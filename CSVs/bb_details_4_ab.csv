","A multi-layered tale of two very different pigs that you will find yourself snickering at . . . yet you will find very thought-provoking. Sidney & Norman uses the simple context of two pigs living next door to each other to communicate a profound truth about how we judge each other and often judge ourselves. On the surface, Sidney & Norman appears to be a picture book that will entertain kids. But this story has deeply moved adult audiences in informal readings, leading to deep-thinking discussions.",1400308348,9781400308347),Hardcover,,48 pages,"

","In the fading industrial city of Worcester, Massachusetts, there are men whose jobs are to brave danger, endure long shifts, and trust other men with their lives. Like their counterparts in cities and small towns everywhere, they are firefighters, and like firefighters everywhere, they take enormous pride in their brotherhood and their calling. On December 3, 1999, as the men of Central Street and other Worcester stations lived their daily lives, worked second jobs, and raised their children, they did not know an inferno unlike anything they had ever seen was about to put them to the ultimate test.The fire at Worcester Cold Storage was ignited by two vagrants' Christmas candle. When the first firefighters arrived on the scene, the building-a hulking, abandoned, windowless warehouse-was waiting to explode. As men fought to contain the flames with hoses, they were suddenly surrounded by confusing, suffocating darkness and searing steam. Worcester Cold Storage-with its mazelike layout and rooms so insulated that they prevented men from hearing each other's alarms-was turning into a furious beast, disorienting those inside it, seemingly determined to kill as many men as it could.3000 DEGREES stands with the best works of American reportage. Sean Flynn takes us into the private lives of men heading inexorably into one sudden shared, overwhelming battle. He captures the agony of working wives and mothers hearing the news with mounting terror and a community being hurtled toward unbearable loss. Most of all, he vividly depicts the moments of truth, when ordinary men know that their brothers are going to die, and that to live with themselves, to take another single breath, they too must be prepared to lay down their lives.",0446528315,9780446528313),Hardcover,,245 pages,"

But strange and disturbing things began to happen. One of the cathedral statues of a foolish virgin disappeared, and also the figure of the gargoyle that spouted above it. The mayor dismissed three of the town's most respected councilors, blaming them for the disappearance. And Anemone and her dog, Winnie, ran away from home - driven to it by the mean housekeeper and her horrid son who had made life miserable for Anemone since Father befriended and took them in.Even Aunt Gundula, a remarkable woman, who had been Anemone's mother's dearest friend and with whom Anemone took refuge, couldn't, at first, understand why things in the town were in such upheaval. It was unheard of that the songbirds which had always been welcomed back by the townspeople each spring were now being caught in nets by the Mayor and his friends, and the Mayor had actually forbidden the sale of Easter eggs. This was more than Gundula, who each year painted the most beautiful eggs for Easter, could stand.",0441886698,9780441886692),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Shelley Young’s The Blood Feud is the first book of the Dardian Dreshaj novels. Who would have thought that the death of an aging ex-mafia boss would start a war between law enforcement, the mafia and a secret criminal underworld organization known as The Association? Homicide Detective Jesse Richards is facing the murder case of his career. With hardly any evidence, no witnesses and no identity of the murderer he’s looking for, for the first time he fears he’s been given a case that will end up in the cold files. Desperate to uncover the reason behind Vito Russo’s seemingly senseless death, he’ll stop at nothing to bring the killer he’s looking for to justice. Just when he believes the case has reached a dead end, he stumbles upon a not so lucky break. Could the ruthless killer he’s looking for be the same man who has stolen his daughter’s heart? Aaliyah Richards is the only good thing going for Dardian Dreshaj, and he would do anything to keep her safe. Dardian has made it known from the beginning, mess with him and he might excuse it, mess with Aaliyah and all rules fly out the window. They knew what he was capable of. They knew Padukshëm was not a myth. The reason they threatened her never mattered. What does matter is after he’s finished with them, they’ll know never to do it again.",,,Kindle Edition,,518 pages,"

","Von den fünfziger Jahren über das Wendejahr 89 bis zum Beginn des neuen Jahrtausends reicht dieser Roman einer Familie. Im Mittelpunkt drei Generationen: Die Großeltern, noch überzeugte Kommunisten, kehren aus dem mexikanischen Exil in die junge DDR heim, um dort ihren Anteil am Aufbau der neuen Republik zu leisten. Ihr Sohn, als junger Mann nach Moskau emigriert und später in ein sibirisches Lager verschleppt, tritt die Reise vom anderen Ende der Welt, dem Ural, an. Er kehrt mit seiner russischen Frau zurück in eine Kleinbürgerrepublik, an deren Veränderbarkeit er weiterhin glauben will. Dem Enkel wird die Wahlheimat von Eltern und Großeltern indes zusehends zu eng - bis er, ausgerechnet am neunzigsten Geburtstag des Patriarchen, in den Westen geht.

","As Henry VIII lies on his deathbed, an incendiary manuscript threatens to tear his court apart in the new installment of C.J. Sansom's Shardlake series.Autumn, 1546. King Henry VIII is slowly, painfully dying. His Protestant and Catholic councillors prepare for a final and decisive power struggle; whoever wins will control the government. The Catholics decide to focus their attack on Henry's sixth wife, the Protestant Queen Catherine Parr. As Catherine begins to lose the King's favour, she turns to the shrewd, hunchbacked lawyer, Matthew Shardlake, to contain a potentially fatal secret.The Queen has written a confessional book, Lamentation of a Sinner, a memoir so radical that if it came to the King's attention, it could bring her and her courtly sympathizers to ruination. The London printer into whose hands she entrusted the manuscript has been murdered, the book nowhere to be found.Shardlake's investigations take him down a trail that begins among printshops in the filthy backstreets of London, but leads him once more to the labyrinthine world of court politics, where Protestant friends can be as dangerous as Catholic enemies, and those who will support either side to further their ambition are the most dangerous of all.",0230744192,9780230744196),Hardcover,,642 pages,"

","It is stated as follows in the 164th verse of Surah al-Baqarah that one of the purposes of the Qur'an's revelation is to think, ""In the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and day, and the ships which sail the seas to people's benefit, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky - by which He brings the Earth to life when it was dead and scatters about in it creature of every kind-- And varying directions of the winds, and the clouds subservient between heaven and earth, there are signs for people who use there intellect"". Hundreds of similar verses in the Qur'an summon people to think on those being that created. When a person examines his own body or any other living thing in nature, in it he sees design, art, plan, and intelligence.

","This is Book 2 of the best selling Riding the Line series. All Rhiannon Blake wants is to find her little sister, Mickey. Even though she knows going to a biker bar alone to search for Mickey isn't the best idea, the last thing Rhee expects is to be assaulted. Before things get too far, Dax Jamison, the sexy, tattooed vice president of the Phantoms motorcycle club comes to her rescue. But Rhee has stepped into the middle of something that is far larger than she expects. Dax insists that the Phantoms provide protection for her until he can figure out why she is being targeted by a rival crew. At first, Rhee clashes with Dax—he’s arrogant, domineering, dangerous—and taken. Will Rhee be able to resist her feelings for her rescuer? Will Dax be able to deny his attraction for the girl he’s taken in to protect? This book contains strong language, violence, abuse, and steamy/graphic sexual scenes which some readers might find offensive. This work is intended for readers over the age of 18.

V Hamburku pracuje ve výzkumném centru spánku, sama však ne a ne usnout. A tak má po nocích spoustu času na vzpomínání: na to, jak před sedmnácti lety strávila jedno osudové léto v rodné vesnici Grund, obklopené rozvětveným tokem Rýna a hustými lesy. To léto prožila se svým nejlepším přítelem Andreasem a Lutzem, první velkou láskou. Na podzim toho roku Ellen zjistí, že je těhotná. Lutz ale zmizel. A Andreas oněměl. Do Grundu se Ellen i se svou dcerou vrací až po sedmnácti letech ve chvíli, kdy její matka umírá. Tajemství minulosti začínají pomalu vyplouvat na povrch. Ellen se znovu zamiluje, tentokrát do náměsíčného Benna – historika, který v grundských lesích pátrá po stopách vojáka, jenž se tu za války ukrýval. Ellen potká také nenápadnou starou paní, která se do vesnice právě přistěhovala. Netuší však, že tajuplná žena přijela pátrat po neobjasněných okolnostech Lutzova zmizení. A že z něho viní právě Ellen. Nikdo by se nenadál, že v tichosti sleduje všechny okolo sebe a rozhodla se jednat…",,,Hardcover,,280 pages,"

","Across two critically acclaimed linked novels, now together in this eBook bundle, Lisa See unfolds a captivating saga of the bonds between women—mothers and daughters, sisters and friends—while illuminating the events of China’s tumultuous history.  SHANGHAI GIRLS   In 1937 Shanghai—the Paris of Asia—twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he has gambled away their wealth. To repay his debts, he must sell the girls as wives to suitors from Los Angeles. As Pearl and May set out from the Chinese countryside to the shores of America, they face impossible choices and confront a life-changing secret, but through it all the two sisters hold fast to who they are—Shanghai girls.  DREAMS OF JOY   Reeling from newly uncovered family secrets, Pearl’s nineteen-year-old daughter, Joy, runs away to Shanghai in early 1957 to find her birth father—an artist with whom both May and Pearl were once in love. Dazzled by him, and blinded by idealism, Joy throws herself into the New Society of Red China, heedless of the dangers in the Communist regime. Terrified for Joy’s safety, Pearl returns to Shanghai, determined to save her daughter. Yet even as Joy’s and Pearl’s journeys converge, one of the most tragic episodes in China’s history threatens their very lives.",0812985478,9780812985474),ebook,,704 pages,"

","“YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE” is a common refrain in the emails Walter Lewin receives daily from fans who have been enthralled by his world-famous video lectures about the wonders of physics. “I walk with a new spring in my step and I look at life through physics-colored eyes,” wrote one such fan. When Lewin’s lectures were made available online, he became an instant YouTube celebrity, and The New York Times declared, “Walter Lewin delivers his lectures with the panache of Julia Child bringing French cooking to amateurs and the zany theatricality of YouTube’s greatest hits.” For more than thirty years as a beloved professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lewin honed his singular craft of making physics not only accessible but truly fun, whether putting his head in the path of a wrecking ball, supercharging himself with three hundred thousand volts of electricity, or demonstrating why the sky is blue and why clouds are white. Now, as Carl Sagan did for astronomy and Brian Green did for cosmology, Lewin takes readers on a marvelous journey in For the Love of Physics, opening our eyes as never before to the amazing beauty and power with which physics can reveal the hidden workings of the world all around us. “I introduce people to their own world,” writes Lewin, “the world they live in and are familiar with but don’t approach like a physicist—yet.” Could it be true that we are shorter standing up than lying down? Why can we snorkel no deeper than about one foot below the surface? Why are the colors of a rainbow always in the same order, and would it be possible to put our hand out and touch one? Whether introducing why the air smells so fresh after a lightning storm, why we briefly lose (and gain) weight when we ride in an elevator, or what the big bang would have sounded like had anyone existed to hear it, Lewin never ceases to surprise and delight with the extraordinary ability of physics to answer even the most elusive questions. Recounting his own exciting discoveries as a pioneer in the field of X-ray astronomy—arriving at MIT right at the start of an astonishing revolution in astronomy—he also brings to life the power of physics to reach into the vastness of space and unveil exotic uncharted territories, from the marvels of a supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud to the unseeable depths of black holes. “For me,” Lewin writes, “physics is a way of seeing—the spectacular and the mundane, the immense and the minute—as a beautiful, thrillingly interwoven whole.” His wonderfully inventive and vivid ways of introducing us to the revelations of physics impart to us a new appreciation of the remarkable beauty and intricate harmonies of the forces that govern our lives.",1439108277,9781439108277),Hardcover,,301 pages,"

That is, until another family tragedy thrusts three children into her care and uproots her life in ways she could never imagine. Lauren's first instinct is to run, until she meets their striking, mysterious neighbor Dean Powell. Their immediate chemistry and his connection with her late father just might be enough to keep her in town long enough to uncover pieces of her past that she never had answers to.

","At the time of his death in 1962, E. E. Cummings was, next to Robert Frost, the most widely read poet in America. Combining Thoreau's controlled belligerence with the brash abandon of an uninhibited bohemian, Cummings, together with Pound, Eliot, and William Carlos Williams, helped bring about the twentieth-century revolution in literary expression. He is recognized on the one hand as the author of some of the most beautiful lyric poems written in the English language, and on the other as one of the most inventive American poets of his time in the worlds of Richard Kostelanetz, ""the major American poet of the middle-twentieth-century.""",0871401525,9780871401526),Hardcover,,1136 pages,"

","In deze historische roman kruipt Simone van der Vlugt op overtuigende wijze in de huid van Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436). Jacoba was haar tijd ver vooruit, stak haar feministische ideeen niet onder stoelen of banken en koos ook in de liefde niet altijd voor de makkelijkste weg. We leren een vrouw kennen die veel te verduren krijgt, maar zich daar niet bij neerlegt en door het onrecht dat haar wordt aangedaan juist strijdbaarder wordt. Simone van der Vlugt laat ons niet alleen een hertogin zien die ten oorlog trekt om haar gewesten te verdedigen, maar ook Jacoba's persoonlijke kant: de ontwikkeling van een kwetsbaar, volgzaam meisje tot een volwassen, sterke vrouw. Haar relatie met haar moeder is er een die voor vele vrouwen herkenbaar zal zijn. Op een knappe manier weet Simone van der Vlugt ons deelgenoot te maken van een oud-Nederlands kostuumdrama en laat ze ons een duik nemen in een geschiedenis waar weinigen een duidelijk beeld van hebben.",9041415319,9789041415318),Paperback,,318 pages,"

Hon tvingar i Alicjas kompisar soppa på sönderkokta grönsaker (sockerbeta? lök? potatis?) med något kött (fläsk? kyckling? människa?) och frågar saker som ingen svensk mamma någonsin skulle fråga. Som om det inte vore nog flyttar även mammans storrökande kusin Sylwia in med sin dotter Celestyna. Celestyna tar Alicjas kläder och Sylwia tvingar med Alicja till Vadstena när påven kommer på Sverigebesök. Naturligtvis slutar det med katastrof.

","In 2008, Simon Fitzmaurice was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (mnd). He was given four years to live. In 2010, in a state of lung-function collapse, Simon knew with crystal clarity that now was not his time to die. Against all prevailing medical opinion, he chose to ventilate in order to stay alive.Here, the young filmmaker, a husband and father of five small children draws us deeply into his inner world. Told in simply expressed and beautifully stark prose - in the vein of such memoirs as Jean-Dominique Bauby's The Diving Bell and the Butterfly - the result is an astonishing journey into a life which, though brutally compromised, is lived more fully and in the moment than most, revealing at its core the power of love its most potent.Written using an eye-gaze computer, It's Not Yet Dark is an unforgettable book about relationships and family, about what connects and separates us as people and, ultimately, about what it means to be alive.",1444795163,9781444795165),ebook,,176 pages,"

","We know the legends: Arthur brought justice to a land that had known only cruelty and force; his father, Uther, carved a kingdom out of the chaos of the fallen Roman Empire; the sword Excalibur, drawn from stone by England's greatest king.But legends do not tell the whole tale. Legends do not tell of the despairing Roman soldiers, abandoned by their empire, faced with the choice of fleeing back to Rome, or struggling to create a last stronghold against the barbarian onslaughts from the north and east. Legends do not tell of Arthur's great-grandfather, Publius Varrus, the warrior who marked the boundaries of a reborn empire with his own shed blood; they do not tell of Publius's wife, Luceiia, British-born and Roman-raised, whose fierce beauty burned pale next to her passion for law and honor.With The Camulod Chronicles, Jack Whyte tells us what legend has forgotten: the history of blood and violence, passion and steel, out of which was forged a great sword, and a great nation. The Singing Sword continues the gripping epic begun in The Skystone: As the great night of the Dark Ages falls over Roman Britain, a lone man and woman fight to build a last stronghold of law and learning--a crude hill-fort, which one day, long after their deaths, will become a great city . . . known as Camelot.",0765304589,9780765304582),Paperback,,384 pages,"

A land made up of twenty-five islands, each one representing one hour of the day, each one a unique place of adventure and danger (and one mysterious place out of time), all ruled over by the evil Christopher Carrion, Lord of Midnight, and his monstrous grandmother, Mater Motley.

","TAKE – verb: to reach for and hold in one’s hands or get into one’s possession, power or control. Logan Mitchell is a man who’s always been more than happy to take what he wants. It’s a philosophy that’s proven lucrative in both his business and personal life, and never was it more apparent than the night he laid eyes on Tate Morrison. After pulling out all the stops and convincing the sexy bartender to give him a try—he’s hooked. Now, Logan finds himself in a predicament that demands more from him than a smart-ass answer and his innate ability to walk away when things get too deep. He has a choice to make, and it’ll force him to do something he’s never done before—take a chance.Tate Morrison knows all about taking a chance. He took the biggest one of his life the night he showed up at Logan’s apartment to explore his unexpected reaction to the man. Ever since then, he’s thought about little else.At first he was convinced his attraction was based solely on his body’s curiosity. But the more time he spends with the silver-tongued lawyer, the more Tate realizes that their physical chemistry is only the beginning. He’s starting to catch a glimpse of what life with Logan would be like, and it’s one full of excitement and satisfaction—a far cry from what he had in the past with his soon to be ex-wife.Each man will face their fears as they begin to understand the true meaning of give and take. Their feelings for one another will be tested, as will their very beliefs.

DIVERGENT – a major motion picture in 2014. Readers first encountered Tobias Eaton as ""Four"" in Divergent. His voice is an integral part of Allegiant. Readers will find more of this charismatic character's backstory told from his own perspective in Four: A Divergent Collection. When read together, these long narrative pieces illuminate the defining moments in Tobias Eaton's life. The first three pieces in this volume – ""The Transfer,"" ""The Initiate,"" and ""The Son"" – follow Tobias's transfer from Abnegation to Dauntless, his Dauntless initiation, and the first clues that a foul plan is brewing in the leadership of two factions. The fourth story, ""The Traitor,"" runs parallel with the events of Divergent, giving readers a glimpse into the decisions of loyalty – and love – that Tobias makes in the weeks after he meets Tris Prior.

Intrigat, Miyashita suna, iar la celalalt capat al firului se dovedeste a fi Keiko, o femeie misterioasa care nu accepta sa-l intilneasca decit cu conditia sa ia o pastila de ecstasy in compania unei „amice de incredere”.

","Tristan und Isolde ist eine der bekanntesten Liebesgeschichten aller Zeiten. Der mutige und listige Ritter Tristan nimmt es auf sich, einen Drachen zu töten, um die schöne Isolde zu gewinnen. Im Auftrag seines Onkels. Doch die beiden jungen Menschen verfallen einer unsterblichen Liebe zueinander, die auch nach Isoldes Hochzeit nicht enden will. Sie begehen Ehebruch. Dieter Kühns kongeniale Übertragung eröffnet einen lebendigen Blick auf das sagenhafte Mittelalter, dessen Sorgen und Nöte unseren so ähnlich sind.Gottfried von Straßburg, Verfasser der um 1210 entstandenen bedeutendsten mhd. Tristandichtung. Der Name des Autors ist nur durch spätere mhd. Dichter überliefert. Lebensdaten sind keine bekannt. Ob der Beiname von Straßburg Herkunfts- oder Wirkungsort (bzw. beides) bezeichnet, ist offen. In den Handschriften wird G. in der Regel als meister (Magister) bezeichnet, Hinweis auf seine lat. Bildung. Da er nirgends als her erscheint, geht man von einer nichtadeligen Herkunft aus. Man nimmt eine Beziehung zum Straßburger Stadtpatriziat an, in dessen Kreis man auch den im Akrostichon des Prologs verschlüsselt genannten Gönner Dieterich vermutet. G. stützte sich auf eine frz. Vorlage, den 'Tristan' des Thômas von Britanje (Thomas d'Angleterre), eine um 1170 entstandene höfische Version des Stoffes, die nur bruchstückhaft überliefert ist. Das Eigene der dt. Dichtung sind zum einen die Kommentare und Reflexionen, die das vielschichtige, anspielungsreiche, ambivalente und von einer ironischen Erzählhaltung geprägte Werk durchdringen, zum andern die artistische Sprachkunst G.s, die Eleganz mit Präzision und Klarheit verbindet. Aus dieser Stilvorstellung erklärt sich vermutlich seine Attacke auf den 'dunklen' Stil Wolframs v. Eschenbach, von dem sich G. auch in seiner skeptischen Auffassung vom Rittertumund seiner eher freizügigen Einstellung in religiösen Fragen unterscheidet. Darüber hinaus steht der von G. noch verschärfte Konflikt zwischen der elementaren Gewalt autonomer Liebe und der gesellschaftlichen Ordnung in deutlichem Gegensatz zu den harmonisierenden Tendenzen des dt. Artusromans. G.s Dichtung bricht mit Vers 19 548 ab; die Fortsetzer Ulrich v. Türheim (um 1240) und Heinrich v. Freiberg (um 1290) sprechen davon, dass der Tod den Dichter an der Vollendung seines Werkes gehindert habe.Dieter Kühn, geboren 1935, ist freier Schriftsteller. Für seine Romane, Biographien, Erzählungen, Kinderbücher, Hör- und Schauspiele ausgezeichnet u. a. mit dem Hermann Hesse-Preis und dem Großen Literaturpreis der Bayerischen Akademie der Schönen Künste. Er war Stadtschreiber von Bergen-Enkheim und Mainz. Der Autor lebt in Köln.",,,,,,,"['Classics', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Medieval', 'European Literature', 'German Literature', 'Romance']"

","From four stunning and accomplished French women--at last--a fresh and spirited take on what it really means to be a Parisienne: how they dress, entertain, have fun and attempt to behave themselves.In short, frisky sections, these Parisian women give you their very original views on style, beauty, culture, attitude and men. The authors--Anne Berest, Audrey Diwan, Caroline de Maigret, and Sophie Mas--unmarried but attached, with children--have been friends for years. Talented bohemian iconoclasts with careers in the worlds of music, film, fashion and publishing, they are untypically frank and outspoken as they debunk the myths about what it means to be a French woman today. Letting you in on their secrets and flaws, they also make fun of their complicated, often contradictory feelings and behavior. They admit to being snobs, a bit self-centered, unpredictable but not unreliable. Bossy and opinionated, they are also tender and romantic.You will be taken on a first date, to a party, to some favorite haunts in Paris, to the countryside, and to one of their dinners at home with recipes even you could do -- but to be out with them is to be in for some mischief and surprises. They will tell you how to be mysterious and sensual, look natural, make your boyfriend jealous, and how they feel about children, weddings and going to the gym. And they will share their address book in Paris for where to go: At the End of the Night, for A Birthday, for a Smart Date, for a A Hangover, for Vintage Finds and much more. How to Be Parisian Wherever You Are will make you laugh as you slip into their shoes to become bold and free and tap into your inner cool.",0385538650,9780385538657),Hardcover,,253 pages,"

But when she holds a house key in her hand like her dad does to read its owner's destiny, she can’t see anything. Maybe it’s because she can't get over the loss of her beloved dog, Sky, who died mysteriously. Sky was Spirit’s loyal companion, one of the wild dogs that the local islanders believe possess dangerous spirits. As more dogs start dying and people become sick, too, almost everyone is convinced that these dogs and their spirits are to blame—except for Spirit. Then Sky's ghost appears, and Spirit is shaken.

","A bestseller in 1941, selected by the Book of the Month Club for a special edition and described by Book of the Month Club News as: “. . . full of sensational revelations and interspersed with episodes of daring, of desperate conflict, of torture, and of ruthless conspiracy . . . It is, first of all, an autobiography the like of which has seldom been.”The son of a seafaring father, Richard Julius Herman Krebs, a.k.a. Jan Valtin, came of age as a bicycle messenger during a maritime rebellion. His life as an intimate insider account of the dramatic events of 1920’s and 1930s, where he rose both within the ranks of the Communist Party and on the Gestapo hit list. Known for his honesty and incredible memory, Krebs dedicated his life to the Communist Party, rising to a position as head of maritime, organizing worldwide for the Comintern, only to flee the Party and Europe to evade his own comrade’s attempts to kill him. As a professional revolutionary, agitator, spy and would-be assassin, Krebs traveled the globe from Germany to China, India to Sierra Leon, Moscow to the United States where a botched assassination attempt landed him a stint in San Quentin.From his spellbinding account of artful deception to gain release from a Nazi prison and his work as a double-agent within the Gestapo, to his vivid depiction of a Communist Party fraught with intrigue and subterfuge, Krebs gives an unflinching portrayal of the internal machinations of both parties.Writing at age 36 under the name Jan Valtin, Krebs lays bare a young life filled with idealism and devotion—disillusionment and loss—in a world full of revolutionary promise gone immeasurably wrong.”An exciting, real book without a trace of unnecessary melodrama.”—H.G.Wells",1902593863,9781902593869),Paperback,,720 pages,"

The negative fall-out from this affliction of self-hate includes child behavior problems, anxiety disorders, depression, addictions, over-dependent relationships, and many other troubles. Yet, part of the self-hate problem comes from the lack of common knowledge and understanding of what healthy self-love is all about.

","July 14, 1099. Jerusalem awaits the invasion of the crusaders who have surrounded the city’s gates. There, inside the ancient city’s walls, men and women of every age and every faith have gathered to hear the wise words of a mysterious man known only as the Copt. He has summoned the townspeople to address their fears with truth:“Tomorrow, harmony will become discord. Joy will be replaced by grief. Peace will give way to war. . . . None of us can know what tomorrow will hold, because each day has its good and its bad moments. So, when you ask your questions, forget about the troops outside and the fear inside. Our task is not to leave a record of what happened on this date for those who will inherit the Earth; history will take care of that. Therefore, we will speak about our daily lives, about the difficulties we have had to face.”The people begin with questions about defeat, struggle, and the nature of their enemies; they contemplate the will to change and the virtues of loyalty and solitude; and they ultimately turn to questions of beauty, love, wisdom, sex, elegance, and what the future holds. “What is success?” poses the Copt. “It is being able to go to bed each night with your soul at peace.”Now, these many centuries later, the wise man’s answers are a record of the human values that have endured throughout time. And, in Paulo Coelho’s hands, The Manuscript Found in Accra reveals that who we are, what we fear, and what we hope for the future come from the knowledge and belief that can be found within us, and not from the adversity that surrounds us.Paulo Coelho One of the most influential writers of our time, Paulo Coelho is the author of many international best sellers, including The Alchemist, Aleph, Eleven Minutes and The Pilgrimage. Translated into 74 languages, his books have sold more than 140 million copies in more than 170 countries. He is a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and in 2007, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace.",,,Hardcover,,172 pages,"

","This is a searing short novel, built of the interlocking fates of a badger-baiter and a disconsolate farmer, unfolding in a stark rural setting where man, animal, land and weather are at loggerheads. Their two paths converge with tragic inevitability. Jones writes of the physiology of grief and the isolation of loss with brilliance, and about the simple rawness of animal existence with a naturalist's unblinking eye. His is a pared-down prose of resonant simplicity and occasional lushness. His writing about ducks and dogs and cows is axe-sharp. There is not a whiff of the bucolic pastoral or the romanticized sod here. This is a real rural ride. It is short, but crackles with latent compressed energy that makes it swell to fill more space than at first glance it occupies.",1847088783,9781847088789),Hardcover,,159 pages,"

How long will we continue to live our lives in a position of weakness and ignorance?  In Are We There Yet?, author Martin L. Davis provides the blueprint for what people of color need to do to change their standing in American society and throughout the world. It delivers a blow-by-blow, step-by-step, challenge-by-challenge outline that speaks directly to the heart of the ills black people face today. It addresses how black Americans can correct those ills internally, without outside help or influence.   Complete with concrete directives, initiatives, and challenges to the black population, Are We There Yet? clearly dictates that black Americans take responsibility and be accountable for their actions and inactions. Davis maintains that following the multiple directives and challenges collectively will guarantee a dramatic and positive change in our communities, our place in American society, and better interaction among one another as a people.""

","A portrait of a resilient African village, ruled until recently by magic and tradition, now facing modern problems and responding, often triumphantly, to change When Sarah Erdman, a Peace Corps volunteer, arrived in Nambonkaha, she became the first Caucasian to venture there since the French colonialists. But even though she was thousands of miles away from the United States, completely on her own in this tiny village in the West African nation of Cote d'Ivoire, she did not feel like a stranger for long. As her vivid narrative unfolds, Erdman draws us into the changing world of the village that became her home. Here is a place where electricity is expected but never arrives, where sorcerers still conjure magic, where the tok-tok sound of women grinding corn with pestles rings out in the mornings like church bells. Rare rains provoke bathing in the streets and the most coveted fashion trend is fabric with illustrations of Western cell phones. Yet Nambonkaha is also a place where AIDS threatens and poverty is constant, where women suffer the indignities of patriarchal customs, where children work like adults while still managing to dream. Lyrical and topical, Erdman's beautiful debut captures the astonishing spirit of an unforgettable community. ",0805073817,9780805073812),Hardcover,,322 pages,"

Yet she refuses to forget her best friend Elizabeth, who she is convinced is missing and in terrible danger.But no one will listen to Maud—not her frustrated daughter, Helen, not her caretakers, not the police, and especially not Elizabeth's mercurial son, Peter. Armed with handwritten notes she leaves for herself and an overwhelming feeling that Elizabeth needs her help, Maud resolves to discover the truth and save her beloved friend.This singular obsession forms a cornerstone of Maud's rapidly dissolving present. But the clues she discovers seem only to lead her deeper into her past, to another unsolved disappearance: her sister, Sukey, who vanished shortly after World War II.As vivid memories of a tragedy that occurred more than fifty years ago come flooding back, Maud discovers new momentum in her search for her friend.

","وفي هذا العمل يقترب الراوي من الذات الإنسانية ونوازعها الخفية فيزاوج ببراعة ما بين أطروحات النقد السردي الحديث وتقنيات علم النفس والتحليل النفسي ليصوغ فيه مركباً نقدياً يسعى إلى استكناه قضايا متعددة: الوطن، الآخر المحتل، العقاب والثواب، القيم والمثل، الحزن والوحدة، الذكريات والتداعيات. وهي في مجموعها خطابات أو رسائل يحدد فيها الروائي تصوره لذاته في علاقتها بالكتابة، ومن ثم يجنح إلى الاهتمام بسؤال فعل الكتابة، حيث يبدو الإلحاح على التجريب مطلباً قوياً بما يعنيه ذلك من انكباب على مسألة الذات. حكاية بطلها ""أشبه بالفيلم السينمائي الممل، وكانت البطولة المطلقة فيه للحزن الذي صمد حتى النهاية. أما السعادة فهي الطفلة المسكينة التي ظهرت بفستانها الأبيض لدقائق معدودة (...) أما حكايتي، فقد كانت عجينة من حزن وألم ويُتم وحرمان ذُرت بذرات سعادة أقل من أن يكون لها طعماً..."". ما يميز العمل تلك الرؤية الواقعية المشوبة باحتمالات الوجدان الرومانسي وأبعاد الحس المأساوي وما يعكسه من مظاهر الضياع والحرمان لواقع الأنا (الفردي) للبطل بقدر ما يحيل على الوجه الآخر للمفارقة متمثلاً في هيمنة الرعب التي فرضتها كواليس غزو الكويت في التسعينات على واقع البطل وفقدانه لوالده ""داوود عبد العزيز"" الذي قضى شهيداً في الدفاع عن بلاده... من هنا تشتد الحبكة الروائية لدى أديبنا عبر خيوط المشهد العاطفي الموسوم بسمات الممانعة والرفض والتعالي التي توجه سلوك الآخر – المعتدي – في مقابل تضخم إحساس الأنا بالإحباط والتدني إلى درجة اليأس والضمور لدى بطل الرواية. وخصوصاً عند فقدانه لوالدته فيما بعد. ""سجين المرايا"" هي أكثر من رسائل، أو حكايات تروى من هنا وهناك، إنها حفر في الذاكرة وقراءة تضم ذلك التنوع – الكويتي – بكل زخمه وكواليسه المدهشة، يصوغ فيها السنعوسي إشكالية يتداخل فيها (الاجتماعي – النفسي) مع (الثقافي - المعرفي) لتاريخ بلاده ليبرز ما بين السطور تدافع الأمل واليأس، وفورة الحب الرومانسي في أسمى وأرق صوره والنظر إلى العالم من خلال ""عيون القلب"" وحدها..",,,Paperback,1st Edition,247 pages,"

","She had rejected her noble birthright and embraced the freedom only a man could claim. She was Romilly who lived among the beasts of hill and forest and communicated with them, who tried humanity and turned it down for its evils and jealousies. She had the MacAran gift, the rare laran that conferred mastery over hawk and horse.There was war in the lands of Darkover, for this was the age of chaos when usurpers took the throne and the true king wandered in disguise with a price on his head. Romilly wanted none of all this, but there were those who shared her talents—the men and women of the Towers. And for them, Romilly was the key.Whether male-garbed or beast-minded, she was also human.

A long-forgotten, fanatical order is out to kill her, and if the Council ever discovers what she did in the Catskills, she's a goner... and so is Aiden. If that's not freaky enough, whenever Alex and Seth spend time ""training""--which really is just Seth's code word for some up-close and personal one-on-one time--she ends up with another mark of the Apollyon, which brings her one step closer to Awakening ahead of schedule. Awesome. But as her birthday draws near, her entire world shatters with a startling revelation and she's caught between love and Fate. One will do anything to protect her. One has been lying to her since the beginning. Once the gods have revealed themselves, unleashing their wrath, lives will be irrevocably changed... and destroyed.

","A rollicking, globe-trotting adventure with a twist: a four-legged heroine you won’t soon forgetElsie Bovary is a cow, and a pretty happy one at that—her long, lazy days are spent eating, napping, and chatting with her best friend, Mallory. One night, Elsie and Mallory sneak out of their pasture; but while Mallory is interested in flirting with the neighboring bulls, Elsie finds herself drawn to the farmhouse. Through the window, she sees the farmer’s family gathered around a bright Box God—and what the Box God reveals about something called an “industrial meat farm” shakes Elsie’s understanding of her world to its core.There’s only one solution: escape to a better, safer world. And so a motley crew is formed: Elsie; Jerry—excuse me, Shalom—a cranky, Torah-reading pig who’s recently converted to Judaism; and Tom, a suave (in his own mind, at least) turkey who can’t fly, but who can work an iPhone with his beak. Toting stolen passports and slapdash human disguises, they head for the airport.Elsie is our wise-cracking, pop-culture-reference-dropping, slyly witty narrator; Tom—who does eventually learn to fly (sort of)—dispenses psychiatric advice in a fake German accent; and Shalom, rejected by his adopted people in Jerusalem, ends up unexpectedly uniting Israelis and Palestinians.

This is what Terry Tempest Williams' mother, the matriarch of a large Mormon clan in northern Utah, told her a week before she died. It was a shock to Williams to discover that her mother had kept journals. But not as much of a shock to discover that the three shelves of journals were all blank. In fifty-four short chapters, Williams recounts memories of her mother, ponders her own Mormon faith, and contemplates the notion of absence in art and in our world. When Women Were Birds is a carefully crafted kaleidoscope that keeps turning around the question: What does it mean to have a voice?",1250024110,9781250024114),Paperback,,228 pages,"

","""Like attending seasons of elegant tea parties—each one resplendent with character and drama. Delicious.”—Maxine Hong Kingston The story of two women whose lives intersect in late-nineteenth-century Japan, The Teahouse Fire is also a portrait of one of the most fascinating places and times in all of history—Japan as it opens its doors to the West. It was a period when wearing a different color kimono could make a political statement, when women stopped blackening their teeth to profess an allegiance to Western ideas, and when Japan’s most mysterious rite—the tea ceremony—became not just a sacramental meal, but a ritual battlefield. We see it all through the eyes of Aurelia, an American orphan adopted by the Shin family, proprietors of a tea ceremony school, after their daughter, Yukako, finds her hiding on their grounds. Aurelia becomes Yukako’s closest companion, and they, the Shin family, and all of Japan face a time of great challenges and uncertainty. Told in an enchanting and unforgettable voice, The Teahouse Fire is a lively, provocative, and lushly detailed historical novel of epic scope and compulsive readability.",1594489300,9781594489303),Hardcover,,391 pages,"

","When U.S. Border Patrol Agent Christian Rivera discovers the body of an undocumented alien in the middle of the vast Sonoran Desert with three enigmatic words carved into her flesh, presumably by her own hand, it triggers a frantic search for the remainder of her party, a group of twenty-five men and women who have inexplicably vanished into the desert.Aided by two of the agency's best trackers, Rivera follows the woman's trail into the brutal heart of one of the hottest and most unforgiving landscapes on the planet, where nothing can survive for long. As more bodies turn up, Rivera and the others begin to realize they may be up against an enemy far deadlier than the desert, an unseen adversary that will stop at nothing to take from them what it needs to survive. A mythical evil that may not be myth at all, but horrifically real, could very well be stalking them, and their only hope of surviving the same fate that befell the missing party lies in deciphering the clues to their disappearance before it's too late. If it isn't already…From Michael McBride, bestselling author of Burial Ground and Snowblind, comes Sunblind, a thrilling new novel of terror and action that will take you on an unforgettable journey from the desperate streets of Mexico, through the deadliest corridor in the world, to a place where mankind was never meant to tread.",1940544335,9781940544335),Paperback,,384 pages,"

Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. “The best of all the Greeks”—strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess—Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine—much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles’ mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller’s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.",0062060635,9780062060631),ebook,,416 pages,"

La abundancia de esa bibliografía y la rigurosidad con que se aplica al análisis serían ya un aval suficiente para entrar en confianza en un texto escrito para descifrar uno de los temas constantes más importantes en la obra literaria de GGM: la medicina, los médicos, los diagnósticos y las enfermedades. Pero es que, además de eso, el autor, en más de un centenar de páginas, con una escritura reconocida por su claridad y pertinencia en sus anteriores libros y en sus habituales columnas de prensa, indaga, analiza y cifra con la habilidad de un cirujano inteligente y paciente cada una de las líneas que en las novelas, cuentos y crónicas (incluida la biografía final) desarrollan dicho tema médico.",,,Paperback,,140 pages,"

","Vanaf juli van zijn tweede jaar aan de universiteit tot januari van het jaar daarop leefde Tsukuru Tazaki met constante gedachten aan de dood. Gedurende die tijd werd hij twintig en dus officieel volwassen, maar die gewichtige dag had geen speciale betekenis voor hem. Al die dagen kwam het idee om zelf een eind aan zijn leven te maken hem voor als het meest natuurlijke en logische wat hij kon doen. Ook nu begrijpt hij nog niet goed waarom hij op het laatste ogenblik die beslissende stap nooit heeft gezet.’Tsukuru Tazaki is opeens helemaal alleen. Zijn oude vrienden, die zijn achtergebleven in zijn geboortestad toen hij in Tokyo ging studeren, willen hem van de ene op de andere dag niet meer kennen. Hij doet de dagelijkse dingen – opstaan, douchen, eten, naar college gaan – maar zijn leven is leeg en hol. En hoewel hij de definitieve stap nooit zet, ouder wordt, afstudeert, een baan vindt en carrière maakt, kan hij het verlies van zijn jeugdvrienden niet loslaten, totdat zijn vriendin Sala hem ertoe aanzet om nu eindelijk eens uit te zoeken wat er gebeurd is al die jaren terug. Maar hoe dieper hij in het verleden graaft, hoe hoger de prijs van vriendschap blijkt te zijn.",9025442072,9789025442071),Paperback,,364 pages,"

Against a tableau of famous historical figures-among them G.H.

","Life is returning to normal since Willow defeated the faerie prince who had ensnared Mistolear in a deadly game. She is refining her skills at Mage School and spending time with her new friends, especially Brand, the handsome knight who has sworn to protect her. Unfortunately, he also drives her mad with his old-fashioned rules about ""proper courtship."" The peace does not last, however, as a misstep in Clarion dooms Willow to play another twisted faerie game. If she loses, faeries will once again be free to wreak havoc in the realms of Mistolear and Earth. The Game Master, King Jarlath of the Unseelie Court, throws Willow and Brand into the Goblin's Gauntlet where goblins, phookas and a host of bloodthirsty creatures are on the hunt. In a surprising move, Jarlath sends his own children into the game as well. Dacia, the female twin, is ruthless and cunning. Theon, the male, is clever, flirtatious and, like all faeries, devastatingly beautiful. Willow struggles to resist Theon's charm, while Brand's jealousy simmers--but with the fate of two realms hanging in the balance, both must push their emotions aside. Can Willow and Brand trust the faerie siblings, or is there more than one game being played?",1770800727,9781770800724),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Winner of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book, Caribbean & Canada and the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award; Finalist for the Governor General's Literary Award for Fiction, the Thomas Head Raddall Atlantic Book Award, and the Winterset AwardWhen a whale beaches itself on the shore of the remote coastal town of Paradise Deep, the last thing any of the townspeople expect to find inside it is a man, silent and reeking of fish, but remarkably alive. The discovery of this mysterious person, soon christened Judah, sets the town scrambling for answers as its most prominent citizens weigh in on whether he is man or beast, blessing or curse, miracle or demon. Though Judah is a shocking addition, the town of Paradise Deep is already full of unusual characters. King-me Sellers, self-appointed patriarch, has it in for an inscrutable woman known only as Devine's Widow, with whom he has a decades-old feud. Her granddaughter, Mary Tryphena, is just a child when Judah washes ashore, but finds herself tied to him all her life in ways she never expects. Galore is the story of the saga that develops between these families, full of bitterness and love, spanning two centuries. With Paradise Deep, award-winning novelist Michael Crummey imagines a realm where the line between the everyday and the otherworldly is impossible to discern. Sprawling and intimate, stark and fantastical, Galore is a novel about the power of stories to shape and sustain us.",1590514343,9781590514344),Paperback,,338 pages,"

","In the grand spy-tale tradition of John le Carré comes this shocking thriller written with insider detail known only to a veteran CIA officer. In present-day Russia, ruled by blue-eyed, unblinking President Vladimir Putin, Russian intelligence officer Dominika Egorova struggles to survive in the post-Soviet intelligence jungle. Ordered against her will to become a “Sparrow,” a trained seductress, Dominika is assigned to operate against Nathaniel Nash, a young CIA officer who handles the Agency’s most important Russian mole.Spies have long relied on the “honey trap,” whereby vulnerable men and women are intimately compromised. Dominika learns these techniques of “sexpionage” in Russia’s secret “Sparrow School,” hidden outside of Moscow. As the action careens between Russia, Finland, Greece, Italy, and the United States, Dominika and Nate soon collide in a duel of wills, tradecraft, and—inevitably—forbidden passion that threatens not just their lives but those of others as well. As secret allegiances are made and broken, Dominika and Nate’s game reaches a deadly crossroads. Soon one of them begins a dangerous double existence in a life-and-death operation that consumes intelligence agencies from Moscow to Washington, DC.Page by page, veteran CIA officer Jason Matthews’s Red Sparrow delights and terrifies and fascinates, all while delivering an unforgettable cast, from a sadistic Spetsnaz “mechanic” who carries out Putin’s murderous schemes to the weary CIA Station Chief who resists Washington “cake-eaters” to MARBLE, the priceless Russian mole. Packed with insider detail and written with brio, this tour-de-force novel brims with Matthews’s life experience, including his knowledge of espionage, counterintelligence, surveillance tradecraft, spy recruitment, cyber-warfare, the Russian use of “spy dust,” and covert communications. Brilliantly composed and elegantly constructed, Red Sparrow is a masterful spy tale lifted from the dossiers of intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. Authentic, tense, and entertaining, this novel introduces Jason Matthews as a major new American talent.",1476706123,9781476706122),Hardcover,,431 pages,"

","Hiç tereddütsüz 20. yüzyılın en büyük düşünürlerinden biri olarak görülebilir Michel Foucault. Onun önemi, her şeyden önce, çağdaş Batı felsefesinde tarihdışı niteliğe sahip olduğu kabul edilen ""özne"" kavramını tarihselleştirme çabasından kaynaklanır. Düşünür, başta elinizdeki kitap olmak üzere birçok çalışmasında öznenin bir felsefi kategori olarak kuruluşuna dair kışkırtıcı sorular ortaya atar: ""Özne"" dediğimiz şey tarihsel süreç içinde nasıl kurulmuştur? Bu kuruluş sürecini hangi söylemsel çerçeveler, hangi bilgi/iktidar mekanizmaları, hangi hakikat oyunları kuşatır? Bireyselleştikçe, yani kendimizi eylemlerimizin birer ""özne""si olarak gördükçe özgürleştiğimiz düşüncesini hangi devasa tertibatlar ayakta tutar?Cinselliğin Tarihi, kariyeri boyunca akıl hastalığının, tıbbın ve hapishanenin tarihi üzerine kafa yoran Foucault'nun son çalışması olur. Ona göre cinsellik, baskıcı bir iktidarın altında özgürleşme mücadelesi veren doğal bir güdü değil, yeni bir iktidar biçiminin işleyişinde merkezi konumda bulunan bir tertibattır. Bu tertibat, kendimizi birer ""özne"" olarak kurmamızda vazgeçilmez işlevler yüklenir; seks etkinliğimizin bizdeki en ""doğal"", en ""temel"", dolayısıyla da en ""öznel"" boyut olduğunu tekrar tekrar anımsatır. Bu tertibata göre bir ""özne"" olarak kendimizi tanımak istiyorsak, cinsellik denen şey üzerine kafa yormalı, onu alabildiğine anlaşılır kılmalı, söyleme dökmeli ve ne olduğumuzu ona sormalıyızdır. Ancak, der Foucault, söz konusu tertibat, içimizdeki o meçhul ""otantik benliği"" açığa çıkardığına inandığımız ölçüde bizimle bütünleşir, görünmez hale gelir ve elimizden kaçar.Bu noktada, elinizdeki çalışmanın başta siyaset felsefesi olmak üzere sosyal bilimlerin tüm alanlarında çığır açan özelliği ortaya çıkar: Cinsellik sorunuyla birlikte ortaya atılan, her şeyden önce bir iktidar sorunudur. Ancak bu sorunu doğru anlayabilmek için de, Batı'daki klasik siyaset düşüncesinin yüzyıllardır kabul ettiği ""baskıcı iktidar"" düşüncesini bir kenara bırakmak, yepyeni bir iktidar kuramı geliştirmek; özgürleşmeye alternatif olarak kendini yaratmayı, arzunun özgürleşmesi yerine zevki yoğunlaştırmayı öne çıkarmak gerekir. İşte elinizdeki kitap, bu yeni iktidar kuramının ortaya atıldığı en önemli metinlerden biridir. Bütün ilişkilerde içkin olarak mevcut olan, yukarıdan değil aşağıdan gelen, sadece yok etmeyip aynı zamanda da üreten ve yeni direniş olanaklarını da beraberinde getiren bu yeni iktidar biçimi, en parlak ifadesini bu metinde bulur. Yazık ki tamamlanmamış bu çalışmanın, sadece olağanüstü bir tarih çalışması değil, aynı zamanda sosyal bilimleri derinden sarsan bir felsefe metni olduğunu unutmamak gerekir.",,,Paperback,Ağır Kitaplar,509 pages,"

","Eminem is a rap phenomenon who's sold more than 57 million records worldwide, won nine Grammys, countless MTV awards, and an Oscar. Since 1999, when he burst into the world's consciousness with the mega-selling The Slim Shady LP, Eminem has revealed in outspoken detail every aspect of his tortured existence. But how much of his music is inspired by the truth, and how much is poetic license? Only one woman knows—his mother Debbie Nelson. The target of some of her son's most memorable lyrics and routinely dismissed as a bad parent, Debbie has suffered one of the worst public character assassinations in recent memory—she's been spat on by fans, attacked and robbed at gunpoint, and reviled on dozens of internet sites as the most hated mother in the world. Yet underneath her complexities lies a mother who remains passionate about her son and who will never cease to rebuild the special relationship they once had. Debbie reveals a bittersweet story of a single mother who gave her son everything in an attempt to make up for his absent father and her own miserable childhood. She tells the inside truth about Marshall Bruce Mathers III, and tries to untangle the outspoken and enigmatic alter egos Eminem and ""Slim Shady"". It's a rocky road and Debbie does not try to conceal the facts. This is her story.",1844544567,9781844544561),Hardcover,,259 pages,"

","From Flannery O’Connor and Rona Jaffe Award winner Lori Ostlund, a debut novel about a man who leaves his longtime partner in New Mexico for a new life in San Francisco, launching him on a tragicomic road trip and into the mysteries of his own Midwestern childhood.Sensitive, big-hearted, and achingly self-conscious, forty-year-old Aaron Englund long ago escaped the confines of his Midwestern hometown, but he still feels like an outcast. After twenty years under the Pygmalion-like direction of his older partner Walter, Aaron at last decides it is time to stop letting life happen to him and to take control of his own fate. But soon after establishing himself in San Francisco—where he alternates between a shoddy garage apartment and the absurdly ramshackle ESL school where he teaches—Aaron sees that real freedom will not come until he has made peace with his memories of Morton, Minnesota: a cramped town whose four hundred souls form a constellation of Aaron’s childhood heartbreaks and hopes.After Aaron’s father died in the town parade, it was the larger-than-life misfits of his childhood—sardonic, wheel-chair bound dwarf named Clarence, a generous, obese baker named Bernice, a kindly aunt preoccupied with dreams of The Rapture—who helped Aaron find his place in a provincial world hostile to difference. But Aaron’s sense of rejection runs deep: when Aaron was seventeen, Dolores—Aaron’s loving, selfish, and enigmatic mother—vanished one night with the town pastor. Aaron hasn’t heard from Dolores in more than twenty years, but when a shambolic PI named Bill offers a key to closure, Aaron must confront his own role in his troubled past and rethink his place in a world of unpredictable, life-changing forces.Lori Ostlund’s debut novel is an openhearted contemplation of how we grow up and move on, how we can turn our deepest wounds into our greatest strengths. Written with homespun charm and unceasing vitality, After the Parade is a glorious new anthem for the outsider.",1476790108,9781476790107),Hardcover,First hardcover edition,340 pages,"

","Ximen Nao, a landowner known for his generosity and kindness to his peasants, is not only stripped of his land and worldly possessions in Mao's Land Reform Movement of 1948, but is cruelly executed, despite his protestations of innocence. He goes to Hell, where Lord Yama, king of the underworld, has Ximen Nao tortured endlessly, trying to make him admit his guilt, to no avail. Finally, in disgust, Lord Yama allows Ximen Nao to return to earth, to his own farm, where he is reborn not as a human but first as a donkey, then an ox, pig, dog, monkey, and finally the big-headed boy Lan Qiansui. Through the earthy and hugely entertaining perspectives of these animals, Ximen Nao narrates fifty years of modern Chinese history, ending on the eve of the new millennium.

All Fen cares about is saving his family, and he'll sacrifice anything that gets in his way. Including his own soul. No longer willing to wait for the machinations of the gods' minions, Fen accepts the trade Kamen Malick offers. Together they set out to rescue Fen's family and kill the man who betrayed them.

","George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, Silas Marner is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics.Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. Silas Marner, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis.Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published Scenes of Clerical Life, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including The Mill on the Floss, Middlemarch, and Daniel Deronda.If you enjoyed Silas Marner, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, also available in Penguin Classics.'I think Silas Marner holds a higher place than any of the author's works. It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect ... which marks a classical work'Henry James",,,Mass Market Paperback,,188 pages,"

He used to make my knees weak just at the sight of him. No one could have predicted it. That's life I suppose. Full of unexpected twists and turns. There were so many times I contemplated walking away; contemplated how much simpler my life would become...but it wasn't that easy; he wasn't easy to walk away from...AveryThere was never any doubt in my mind that Austyn was the woman I would be spending the rest of my life with, I just didn’t see the rush to the alter if we already knew that. My eyes never wandered, and, why would they? She was a modern-day goddess. No one could have prepared me for that day. Had I known, I still believe the outcome would have remained the same. I know it was difficult on her, it would have been difficult on anyone, but she stayed strong for me. I honestly believe she saved me-she saved my life.Against All Odds is the fifth book and final installment of the Infinite Love series.",,,Kindle Edition,,232 pages,"

","This exquisite, resonant novel by PEN/Faulkner winner James Salter is a brilliant portrait of a marriage by a contemporary American master. It is the story of Nedra and Viri, whose favored life is centered around dinners, ingenious games with their children, enviable friends, and near-perfect days passed skating on a frozen river or sunning on the beach. But even as he lingers over the surface of their marriage, Salter lets us see the fine cracks that are spreading through it, flaws that will eventually mar the lovely picture beyond repair. Seductive, witty, and elegantly nuanced, Light Years is a classic novel of an entire generation that discovered the limits of its own happiness—and then felt compelled to destroy it.",0679740732,9780679740735),Paperback,,308 pages,"

","Majestically told and based on materials not available to any previous biographer, the definitive life of Andrew Carnegie-one of American business's most iconic and elusive titans-by the bestselling author of The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst.  Celebrated historian David Nasaw, whom The New York Times Book Review has called ""a meticulous researcher and a cool analyst,"" brings new life to the story of one of America's most famous and successful businessmen and philanthropists- in what will prove to be the biography of the season.  Born of modest origins in Scotland in 1835, Andrew Carnegie is best known as the founder of Carnegie Steel. His rags to riches story has never been told as dramatically and vividly as in Nasaw's new biography. Carnegie, the son of an impoverished linen weaver, moved to Pittsburgh at the age of thirteen. The embodiment of the American dream, he pulled himself up from bobbin boy in a cotton factory to become the richest man in the world. He spent the rest of his life giving away the fortune he had accumulated and crusading for international peace. For all that he accomplished and came to represent to the American public-a wildly successful businessman and capitalist, a self-educated writer, peace activist, philanthropist, man of letters, lover of culture, and unabashed enthusiast for American democracy and capitalism-Carnegie has remained, to this day, an enigma.  Nasaw explains how Carnegie made his early fortune and what prompted him to give it all away, how he was drawn into the campaign first against American involvement in the Spanish-American War and then for international peace, and how he used his friendships with presidents and prime ministers to try to pull the world back from the brink of disaster.  With a trove of new material-unpublished chapters of Carnegie's Autobiography; personal letters between Carnegie and his future wife, Louise, and other family members; his prenuptial agreement; diaries of family and close friends; his applications for citizenship; his extensive correspondence with Henry Clay Frick; and dozens of private letters to and from presidents Grant, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and British prime ministers Gladstone and Balfour, as well as friends Herbert Spencer, Matthew Arnold, and Mark Twain-Nasaw brilliantly plumbs the core of this facinating and complex man, deftly placing his life in cultural and political context as only a master storyteller can.",1594201048,9781594201042),Hardcover,,896 pages,"

","The most relentless, deeply disturbing thriller writer since Jeffery Deaver and Gillian FlynnFor years, best friends Sarah and Jennifer kept what they called the “Never List”: a list of actions to be avoided, for safety’s sake, at all costs. But one night, against their best instincts, they accept a cab ride with grave, everlasting consequences. For the next three years, they are held captive with two other girls in a dungeon-like cellar by a connoisseur of sadism.Ten years later, at thirty-one, Sarah is still struggling to resume a normal life, living as a virtual recluse under a new name, unable to come to grips with the fact that Jennifer didn’t make it out of that cellar. Now, her abductor is up for parole and Sarah can no longer ignore the twisted letters he sends from jail.Finally, Sarah decides to confront her phobias and the other survivors—who hold their own deep grudges against her. When she goes on a cross-country chase that takes her into the perverse world of BDSM, secret cults, and the arcane study of torture, she begins unraveling a mystery more horrifying than even she could have imagined.A shocking, blazingly fast read, Koethi Zan’s debut is a must for fans of Karin Slaughter, Laura Lippman, and S.J.

","Alain Bonnard, the owner of a small art cinema in Paris, is a dyed-in-the-wool nostalgic. In his Cinéma Paradis there are no buckets of popcorn, no XXL coca-colas, no Hollywood blockbusters. Not a good business plan if you want to survive, but Alain holds firm to his principles of quality. He wants to show films that create dreams, and he likes most of the people that come to his cinema. Particularly the enchanting, shy woman in the red coat who turns up every Wednesday in row 17. What could her story be? One evening, Alain plucks up courage and invites the unknown beauty to dinner. The most tender of love stories is just getting under way when something incredible happens: The Cinéma Paradis is going to be the location of Allan Woods' new film Tender Memories of Paris. Solène Avril, the famous American director's favourite actress, has known the cinema since childhood and has got it into her head that she wants the film to be shot there. Alain is totally overwhelmed when he meets her in person. Suddenly, the little cinema and its owner are the focus of public attention, and the red-plush seats are sold out every evening.But the mystery woman Alain has just fallen in love with seems suddenly to have vanished. Is this just coincidence? Alain sets off in search of her and becomes part of a story more delightful than anything the cinema has to offer.",1250043123,9781250043122),Paperback,,288 pages,"

Though his father is a reclusive scholar, his mother a pious though confused Catholic, and his uncle a shameless opportunist determined to gain power in the shifting politics of their post-colonial nation, Matapari remains an unsullied child who wears Reeboks, drinks Coke, reads Japanese comics, and watches Rambo. But when his family becomes the nucleus of the revolution for democracy, Matapari proves to be the ideal narrator for this story of violent upheaval and bloody corruption–a voice whose ironic innocence makes bearable and even humorous the awful realities of the world it describes.",0385721226,9780385721226),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Forward ""Incidentally, I despise everything which merely instructs me without increasing or immediately enlivening my activity."" These are Goethe's words. With them, as with a heartfelt expression of Ceterum censeo [I judge otherwise], our consideration of the worth and the worthlessness of history may begin. For this work is to set down why, in the spirit of Goethe's saying, we must seriously despise instruction without vitality, knowledge which enervates activity, and history as an expensive surplus of knowledge and a luxury, because we lack what is still most essential to us and because what is superfluous is hostile to what is essential. To be sure, we need history. But we need it in a manner different from the way in which the spoilt idler in the garden of knowledge uses it, no matter how elegantly he may look down on our coarse and graceless needs and distresses. That is, we need it for life and action, not for a comfortable turning away from life and action or merely for glossing over the egotistical life and the cowardly bad act. We wish to use history only insofar as it serves living. But there is a degree of doing history and a valuing of it through which life atrophies and degenerates. To bring this phenomenon to light as a remarkable symptom of our time is every bit as necessary as it may be painful. I have tried to describe a feeling which has often enough tormented me. I take my revenge on this feeling when I expose it to the general public. Perhaps with such a description someone or other will have reason to point out to me that he also knows this particular sensation but that I have not felt it with sufficient purity and naturalness and definitely have not expressed myself with the appropriate certainty and mature experience. Perhaps one or two will respond in this way. However, most people will tell me that this feeling is totally wrong, unnatural, abominable, and absolutely forbidden, that with it, in fact, I have shown myself unworthy of the powerful historical tendency of the times, as it has been, by common knowledge, observed for the past two generations, particularly among the Germans. Whatever the reaction, now that I dare to expose myself with this natural description of my feeling, common decency will be fostered rather than shamed, because I am providing many opportunities for a contemporary tendency like the reaction just mentioned to make polite pronouncements. Moreover, I obtain for myself something of even more value to me than respectability: I become publicly instructed and set straight about our times.  This essay is also out of touch with the times because here I am trying for once to see as a contemporary disgrace, infirmity, and defect something of which our age is justifiably proud, its historical culture. For I believe, in fact, that we are all suffering from a consumptive historical fever and at the very least should recognize that we are afflicted with it. If Goethe with good reason said that with our virtues we simultaneously cultivate our faults and if, as everyone knows, a hypertrophic virtue (as the historical sense of our age appears to me to be) can serve to destroy a people just as well as a hypertrophic vice, then people may make allowance for me this once. Also in my defence I should not conceal the fact that the experiences which aroused these feelings of torment in me I have derived for the most part from myself and only from others for the purpose of comparison and that, insofar as I am a student more of ancient times, particularly the Greeks, I come as a child in these present times to such anachronistic experiences concerning myself....",,,Kindle Edition,,78 pages,"

","My name is Hemy Knox and I’m a fucking heartbreaker . . .I’ve hurt the one person that means the most to me in life; the only woman I have ever fucking loved. I let the drugs, alcohol and wild life take over; consume me. I got her where I wanted her and ripped her fucking heart out.Since then, I’ve spent countless nights having dirty, meaningless sex with a multitude of people; only leaving them wanting and begging for more with no regrets. Some may even call me the devil; soulless.They look and judge, but there is one thing they don’t know; no one does. I want more than this life of stripping and sleeping around; the never ending party. I want love and everything that comes with it; that high that never ends. The problem is . . . I only want it with her.Onyx.She refuses to be mine . . . again. She’s smart and it’s a mother fucking pain in my ass; guarding her heart while ripping mine right out of my chiseled chest. I can’t say that I blame her. I always was a dumb ass when it came to the emotions of a woman, especially her.She wants to see me suffer as much as I made her; watch me wither and fucking die at her feet. She wants to crush me until I’m no longer breathing and I will let her, because it hurts far less than not having her as mine.I will stop at nothing to make her mine again. The pain only drives me harder; feeding my fury and giving me a reason to live . . . her.***Author's note*** Due to strong language and a very high amount of sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.

","Conceived as a fairly serious guide to amateur boating on the Thames in 1889, Jerome K. Jerome's best-known novel ended up as a hilarious account of the misadventures of three friends and a dog as they attempt to relax and enjoy themselves amid unreliable weather forecasts, imaginary illnesses, repellent cooking, and an unopenable can of pineapple chunks.Three Men in a Boat was a terrific success for its author, and a surprisingly accurate portrayal of the age. George, Harris, and J., the narrator, were entertaining representatives of the new middle class, seeking to escape the dreary world of offices and desks during weekend trips out into the countryside. Jerome's heroes proved so popular that he brought them back for an equally picaresque bicycle tour of Germany, an adventure recorded in Three Men on the Bummel. The new Introduction by Jeremy Lewis describes the social context of the two books and the remarkable life of their author.",0140063927,9780140063929),Paperback,,208 pages,"

The tragedy Henry IV dramatizes the lucid madness of a man who may be King. In So It Is (If You Think So) the townspeople exercise a morbid curiosity attempting to discover 'the truth' about the Ponza family. Each of these plays can lay claim to being Pirandello's masterpiece, and in exploring the nature of human personality each one stretches the resources of drama to their limits.",014018922X,9780140189223),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","""Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful?"" Estragon's complaint, uttered in the first act of ""Waiting for Godot"", is the playwright's sly joke at the expense of his own play - or rather at the expense of those in the audience who expect theatre always to consist of events progressing in an apparently purposeful and logical manner towards a decisive climax. In those terms, ""Waiting for Godot"" - which has been famously described as a play in which ""nothing happens, twice""- scarcely seems recognizable as theatre at all. As the great English critic wrote ""Waiting for Godot jettisons everything by which we recognize theatre. It arrives at the custom-house, as it were, with no luggage, no passport, and nothing to declare; yet it gets through, as might a pilgrim from Mars.""",0802130348,9780802130341),Paperback,,111 pages,"

Why does recalling the 10 Commandments reduce our tendency to lie, even when we couldn't possibly be caught? Why do we splurge on a lavish meal but cut coupons to save 25 cents on a can of soup? Why do we go back for second helpings at the unlimited buffet, even when our stomachs are already full? And how did we ever start spending $4.15 on a cup of coffee when, just a few years ago, we used to pay less than a dollar?When it comes to making decisions in our lives, we think we're in control. We think we're making smart, rational choices. But are we? In a series of illuminating, often surprising experiments, MIT behavioral economist Dan Ariely refutes the common assumption that we behave in fundamentally rational ways. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms, and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day, but we make the same types of mistakes, Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable - making us predictably irrational.From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. Predictably Irrational will change the way we interact with the world - one small decision at a time.",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged,,"

","Popularity has its pitfalls, and Polly is discovering them firsthand in this middle-grade M!X novel.Polly Pierce likes being the second-most popular girl at Winston Academy, right after her BFF, Kelsy. Popularity comes with special privileges, like a seat at the best table in the cafeteria and a coveted spot on the planning committee for the school’s big talent show competition, Groove It Up! And since all Polly has to do is agree with whatever Kelsy says, being popular is easy—even if kids do call her “Plastic Polly” behind her back.But when a freak accident takes Kelsy out of the picture, Polly is suddenly in charge of the Groove It Up! committee. She’s not prepared for her new status—and neither is anyone else. Backstabbing friends, an intimidating crush, and diva demands from an injured Kelsy all threaten to derail Polly’s plans. Can she prove to everyone—and herself—that she has a personality of her own?",144245248X,9781442452480),Paperback,,240 pages,"

And she'll spend all of her free time studying for the SATs or grieving silently with her mother over her father's recent unexpected death. But everything changes when Macy is corralled into helping out at one of her mother's open house events, and she meets the chaotic Wish Catering crew. Before long, Macy joins the Wish team.

","Мартин ни представя за първи път своя „странстващ рицар” без потекло сър Дънкан Високия и скуайъра му Ег в повестта „Странстващият рицар”, станала финалист за Световната награда за фентъзи. Двамата герои стават много популярни и се завръщат за нови приключения в „Заклетият меч”. В следващата изпълнена с живот и изключително занимателна повест „Тайнственият рицар” Мартин повежда Дънк и Ег към ново приключение, в което двамата участват в зловещ турнир, в който абсолютно нищо не е такова, каквото изглежда – включително и главните герои! Династията, основана от Егон и сестрите му, устояла близо триста години. Друг крал от рода на Таргариен, Дерон Втори, по-късно включил Дорн във владението и обединил цял Вестерос под един владетел. Направил го с брак, не със завоевание, тъй като последният от драконите умрял половин век преди това. Действието в „Странстващият рицар” се разиграва в последните дни от властването на Добрия крал Дерон, около сто години преди началото на първия от романите „Песен за огън и лед”, докато владението е в мир и династията Таргариен е на върха си. Разказва историята за първата среща между Дънк, скуайър на странстващ рицар, и Ег, момче, което е много повече, отколкото изглежда на пръв поглед, и за великия турнир на Ашфордски лъг. „Заклетият меч”, следващото сказание, подхваща историята им около година по-късно.",,,Paperback,,304 pages,"

So when her impulsive, short-lived marriage ends in heartbreak, she decides it’s time for a change. She moves to Miami with the intention of hitting reset on her irresponsible life, and she does quite well…aside from an epically humiliating one-night stand in Cancun with a hot blond bouncer named Ben. Thank God she can get on a plane and leave that mistake behind her.Football scholarship and frat parties with hot chicks? Part of charmer Ben Morris’s plan. Blown knee that kills any hope of a professional football career? So not part of the plan. Luckily Ben has brains to go with his knockout looks and magnetism. After three long years of balancing law school with his job as a bouncer at Penny’s Palace, he’s ready to lead a more mature life—until his first day of work, when he finds himself in the office of that crazy, hot chick he met in Cancun. The one he hasn’t stopped thinking about.If Ben truly were a smart guy, he’d stay clear of Reese. She’s the boss’s stepdaughter and it’s been made very clear that office romances are grounds for dismissal. Plus, rumor has it she’s trouble.

","My name is Eric Riordan. Once, I was a wealthy man leading a comfortable, easy life. Then my old friend Gabriel told me how the world would end. Gabriel tried to help me. He taught me everything he learned as a Scout Sniper in the Marine Corps. All the hard lessons from years spent in the sand choked battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. I did everything I could to prepare. I thought I was ready.I was wrong.When the Outbreak came, it destroyed everything. The dead rose to consume the living, and all that mankind spent so many millennia working to build was laid to waste in a matter of months. The undead spared no one, leaving only ashes and death in their wake.For those of us still alive, every single day is a struggle. In spite of the danger, and the darkness, I still believe there is a chance that the human race can rebuild. If I can make my way North and enlist Gabriel's help, maybe we can find enough people to start over again. It won't be easy, though. I have to make my way across the ruins of the old world, and along the way my will to live, my humanity, and my very soul will be tested.I have food, I have a pickup truck, and I have my trusty rifle. Most importantly, I have hope. Hope is a powerful thing, but I will need much more than that if I am to survive the dead.This is the beginning. This is my story.",,,Kindle Edition,,349 pages,"

[Armand] until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles. Here he assumes center stage, relating his five hundred years of life to fledgling vampire David Talbot, who plays amanuensis to Armand as he did to Lestat.... It's not just the epic plot by Rice's voluptuary worldview that's the man attraction.... Elegant narrative has always been her hallmark.... Rice is equally effective in showing how Armand eventually loses his religion and becomes 'the vagabond angel child of Satan,' living under the Paris cemeteries and founding the Grand Guignol-ish Theatre des Vampires. In the twentieth century, a rehabilitated Armand regains his faith but falls in love with two children who save his life.

","“The blood-song rose with an unexpected tune, a warm hum mingling recognition with an impression of safety. He had a sense it was welcoming him home.” Vaelin Al Sorna, warrior of the Sixth Order, called Darkblade, called Hope Killer. The greatest warrior of his day, and witness to the greatest defeat of his nation: King Janus’s vision of a Greater Unified Realm drowned in the blood of brave men fighting for a cause Vaelin alone knows was forged from a lie. Sick at heart, he comes home, determined to kill no more. Named Tower Lord of the Northern Reaches by King Janus’s grateful heir, he can perhaps find peace in a colder, more remote land far from the intrigues of a troubled Realm. But those gifted with the blood-song are never destined to live a quiet life. Many died in King Janus’s wars, but many survived, and Vaelin is a target, not just for those seeking revenge but for those who know what he can do. The Faith has been sundered, and many have no doubt who their leader should be. The new King is weak, but his sister is strong. The blood-song is powerful, rich in warning and guidance in times of trouble, but is only a fraction of the power available to others who understand more of its mysteries. Something moves against the Realm, something that commands mighty forces, and Vaelin will find to his great regret that when faced with annihilation, even the most reluctant hand must eventually draw a sword.",0425265625,9780425265628),Hardcover,US edition,602 pages,"

She’s just a good time at a party. She’s stupid, heartless, cold and useless. All she cares about is getting a guy to look at her. Why would anyone want to be her friend?”Some of those things are true. Others were true. They’re all hurtful. None of it matters.I’m ready to make the hard choices. I’m ready to face the consequences. I’m ready to be the girl I was before, and I’m done being the one who lost her way. I’m ready to become the girl Houston Orr sees when he looks at me. Houston isn’t a star athlete. He doesn’t play in a band. He’s never going to be president, and his life is so far away from simple and easy it isn’t even funny. He wasn’t part of my plan. But I’m starting to think plans are overrated, and maybe our stories are what we make them. And mine depends entirely on me, and the choices I make…starting now.Houston is my fairytale. He’s perfectly imperfect. He’s poetry and life. He’s truth and heartbreak, all rolled up in a tall body with dark hair, broad shoulders and green eyes that lull me into submission. He’s nothing I ever thought I wanted, but the very thing I need. He’s the only guy I’ve ever really loved, and he thinks I’m a princess. I fell into him, and now I’m holding on.But sometimes life takes away our ability to choose. Sometimes…things aren’t in your control. Sometimes, it hurts to be selfless. My only hope is that when it comes time to choose, I get it right.Welcome to my once upon a time and wish for happily ever after.",,,,,,,"['New Adult', 'Romance', 'Academic', 'College', 'Contemporary']"

","One question, a split-second decision, and Brian Darby lies dead on the kitchen floor. His wife, state police trooper Tessa Leoni, claims to have shot him in self-defense, and bears the bruises to back up her tale. For veteran detective D. D. Warren it should be an open-and-shut case. But where is their six-year-old daughter?As the homicide investigation ratchets into a frantic statewide search for a missing child, D. D. Warren must partner with former lover Bobby Dodge to break through the blue wall of police brotherhood, seeking to understand the inner workings of a trooper’s mind while also unearthing family secrets. Would a trained police officer truly shoot her own husband? And would a mother harm her own child? For Tessa Leoni, the worst has not yet happened. She is walking a tightrope, with nowhere to turn, no one to trust, as the clock ticks down to a terrifying deadline. She has one goal in sight, and she will use every ounce of her training, every trick at her disposal, to do what must be done. No sacrifice is too great, no action unthinkable. A mother knows who she loves. And all others will be made to pay.",0553807250,9780553807257),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Tascabili Omnibus 11.Il gioco di inventare paesi fantastici, genti immaginarie, usi e costumi pittoreschi ha una salda tradizione alle sue spalle, e la fantascienza vi ha fatto ricorso un numero infinito di volte. Raramente però questo gioco ha raggiunto i vertici di umorismo toccato da L. Sprague de Camp nel suo ""ciclo di Novaria"". I bersagli contro cui De Camp indirizza le sue frecciate sono ben noti ai lettori di fantascienza: la saccenteria dei pedanti, la vanagloria dei guerrieri da poltrona, l'astuzia truffaldina dei demagoghi. Perciò si può essere sicuri, iniziando a leggere una sua opera, che troveremo, dietro la maschera dell'ambiente immaginario, situazioni e comportamenti che ci circondano nella vita di tutti i giorni.Il mondo di Novaria è un reame tipicamente alla maniera di De Camp. Vi domina una curiosa e ribalda anarchia di forme politiche e sociali. Regni costituzionali e no, repubbliche oscurantiste o illuminate, e anche il puro e semplice dominio del più forte: ognuna di queste forme vi trova dei convinti assertori.In questo mondo, l'unica persona capace di avvertire le incongruenze che lo circondano è il protagonista del romanzo, Jorian. Re per caso, avventuriero suo malgrado, cantastorie per vocazione, viene coinvolto nella estenuante ricerca di un antico tesoro: in essa incontrerà ogni sorta di nemici e di pericoli, nella miglior tradizione dell'avventura eroicomica. Contiene tre racconti: La torre di Goblin (The Goblin Tower, 1968),Jorian di Jiraz (The Clocks of Iraz, 1971),Il re non decapitato (The Unbeheaded King, 1983).",8842907642,9788842907640),Paperback,,602 pages,"

Now, twenty years later, in the heat of a New Mexican summer, Thomas has begun having bizarre conversations with his dead relatives and it's up to Amina-a photographer in the midst of her own career crisis-to figure out what is really going on. But getting to the truth is far harder than it seems. From Thomas's unwillingness to talk, to Kamala's Born Again convictions, to run-ins with a hospital staff that seems to know much more than they let on, Amina finds herself at the center of a mystery so thick with disasters that to make any headway at all, she has to unravel the family's painful past.",0812994787,9780812994780),Hardcover,,512 pages,"

Il exprime une expérience extatique de Dieu, «Lumière des Lumières», dévoile dans l'univers sensible les multiples miroirs des Intelligences et des Âmes.Il ressuscite la sagesse de l'Iran zoroastrien et, fidèle au platonisme, fonde en métaphysique le sentiment gnostique de la vie : la Ténèbre, les substances qui «portent en elles nuit et mort» s'opposent aux Lumières angéliques. Cette philosophie dramatique de l'existence s'achève en un magnifique chant de l'âme, en l'une des plus puissantes théories de la béatitude.Le lecteur trouvera ici, en outre, les deux commentaires qu'en ont fait Qotboddîn Shîrâzî (VIIe/XIIIe s.) et Mollâ Sadrâ Shîrâzî (XIe/XVIIe s.), lui-même le plus grand philosophe du shî'isme iranien.",2070427218,9782070427215),Paperback,,704 pages,"

A beautiful, heartfelt, funny and inspiring collection of photographs capturing the spirit of a city
In the summer of 2010, photographer Brandon Stanton set out on an ambitious project: to single-handedly create a photographic census of New York City.  Armed with his camera, he began crisscrossing the city, covering thousands of miles on foot, all in an attempt to capture New Yorkers and their stories.  The result of these efforts was a vibrant blog he called ""Humans of New York,"" in which his photos were featured alongside quotes and anecdotes. Humans of New York is the book inspired by the Internet sensation. With four hundred color photos, including exclusive portraits and all-new stories, Humans of New York is a stunning collection of images that showcases the outsized personalities of New York.Surprising and moving, Humans of New York is a celebration of individuality and a tribute to the spirit of the city.",1250038820,9781250038821),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Set against dramatic Mediterranean Sea views and lush olive groves, The Rocks opens with a confrontation and a secret: What was the mysterious, catastrophic event that drove two honeymooners apart so suddenly and absolutely in 1948 that they never spoke again despite living on the same island for sixty more years? And how did their history shape the Romeo and Juliet–like romance of their (unrelated) children decades later? Centered around a popular seaside resort club and its community, The Rocks is a double love story that begins with a mystery, then moves backward in time, era by era, to unravel what really happened decades earlier.Peter Nichols writes with a pervading, soulful wisdom and self-knowing humor, and captures perfectly this world of glamorous, complicated, misbehaving types with all their sophisticated flaws and genuine longing. The result is a bittersweet, intelligent, and romantic novel about how powerful the perceived truth can be—as a bond, and as a barrier—even if it’s not really the whole story; and how one misunderstanding can echo irreparably through decades.",1594633312,9781594633317),Hardcover,,432 pages,"

Tim was a former armored car driver lying low on the cruise ship after making off with half a million dollars of his employer's cash. Amber was the successful CEO of a mult-million dollar publishing company taking a much needed vacation from her high-stress job.  Neither one could have predicted their cruise ship would be hijacked by terrorists. Neither one could have predicted they would have to rely on each other to survive.  But the terrorists are the least of their problems. After the cruise ship's controls are blasted and the ship sent far off course, they find themselves shipwrecked on a remote Pacific island. On the island, Tim and Amber must survive outrageous terrors created by a twisted science that exceed a lunatic's most deranged nightmares.",,,Kindle Edition,,322 pages,"

In the aftermath, Aurora Esperanza grows distant from her mother, Felicia, who as a housekeeper in the Hollywood Hills establishes a unique relationship with a detached housewife.The Esperanzas’ shifting lives connect with those of various members of their neighborhood. A day laborer trolls the streets for work with men half his age and witnesses a murder that pits his morality against his illegal status; a religious hypocrite gets her comeuppance when she meets the Virgin Mary at a bus stop on Sunset Boulevard; a typical bus route turns violent when cultures and egos collide in the night, with devastating results; and Aurora goes on a journey through her gentrified childhood neighborhood in a quest to discover her own history and her place in the land that all Mexican Americans dream of, ""the land that belongs to us again.""

She never dared dream their shared waltz would rekindle their affection for one another. But she knows loving Lord Ryerton is impossible, because Elizabeth hides a dark and dangerous secret.
A Tribute to The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes
This novella is a tipping of the hat to Alfred Noyes. Oh, what silken dreams were spun on the wheel of his romantic poem, The Highwayman. If you leaned out the window with the innkeeper's daughter and sighed over the dashing highwayman, this is a story for you. Several verses are echoed in the chapter headings, and the complete poem is available at the end of the book.This improbable tale is written solely for your delight and enjoyment. Should you happen to crave more information about the highly romanticized, sometimes brutal truths behind the real highwaymen of myth and legend, please visit Kathleen's website.Until then, take a deep breath; close your eyes to harsh realities, and stroll into Claegburn Woods where the moon rides high and the owls are hunting on silent wing, there we will enter the lives of a rather unusual band of Robinhoodlums.",,,Kindle Edition,,77 pages,"

Ve hemen fırlayarak yerimden Penceremde demirlere yapışarak hürriyetin sütbeyaz maviliğine sana yazdıklarımı bağıra bağıra okumalıyım...Nâzım Hikmetin seçme şiirlerinden oluşan Ne Güzel Şey Hatırlamak Seni kitabı, kitap ve kitapla birlikte verilen 4 CD ekinden oluşuyor.CDlerde sanatçı Genco Erkalın sesinden dinleyeceğimiz 51 Nâzım şiiri, şairin hemen bütün kitaplarından, şiir serüveninin gelişmesini de gözeten, sevda, hasret ve siyasi şiirlerinden dengeli bir seçim yapılarak hazırlandı.Yapı Kredi Yayınları tarafından yayımlanan Ne Güzel Şey Hatırlamak Seni kitabındaki Nâzım Hikmet şiirlerinden bazıları ise şöyle: Hasret, Sesini Kaybeden Şehir, Mavi Gözlü Dev, Minnacık Kadın ve Hanımelleri, Karıma Mektup, Ne Güzel Şey Hatırlamak Seni, Karlı Kayın Ormanında, Ceviz Ağacı, Mavi Liman, Kara Haber ve Henüz Vakit Varken Gülüm.""Genco Erkal'ın sesinden Nâzım Hikmet Şiirleri'ni seçerken, YKY'nin (daha önceden Memet Fuat'ın yönetiminde yayımlanan) Nâzım külliyatının sırasını gözettik. Bu çalışma sırasında Nâzım'ın hemen bütün kitaplarından, şiir serüveninin gelişmesini de gözeten örnekler seçmeye çalıştık. Genco Erkal'ın önerisiyle listeye ekler de yaptık. Sonuçta Nâzım'ın sevda, hasret ve siyasi şiirlerinden dengeli bir seçim ortaya çıktı.Bazı şiirler uzun şiirlerin parçası ya da adsız (bazen de başlıklı) olduğu için, CD listesinde ve içindekilerde, arandığında kolay bulunsun diye, bilinen ve hemen hatırlanan ilk dizelerini, köşeli parantez içinde belirttik. O yüzden içindekiler listesi ile CD listesinde küçük farklılıklar oluştu.Nâzım külliyatından yalnızca Memleketimden İnsan Manzaraları'ndan parçalar almadık. Belki bu bizi yeni bir çalışma yapmaya yöneltecektir.",,,Audio CD,,224 pages,"

O mundo parece voltar ao tempo da Guerra Fria.Enquanto no Ocidente ainda se recorda a era Gorbatchov com alguma simpatia, na Rússia há quem procure esquecer esse período e o designe por a Catástrofe Russa. E, desde então, emergiu uma nova geração de russos, que anseia pela grandiosidade de outrora, ao mesmo tempo que exalta Estaline como um grande homem.Com uma acuidade e uma atenção únicas, Svetlana Aleksievitch reinventa neste magnífico requiem uma forma polifónica singular, dando voz a centenas de testemunhas, os humilhados e ofendidos, os desiludidos, o homem e a mulher pós-soviéticos, para assim manter viva a memória da tragédia da URSS e narrar a pequena história que está por trás de uma grande utopia.",,,Paperback,,469 pages,"

","Devil in the Grove is the winner of the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.Arguably the most important American lawyer of the twentieth century, Thurgood Marshall was on the verge of bringing the landmark suit Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court when he became embroiled in an explosive and deadly case that threatened to change the course of the civil rights movement and cost him his life.In 1949, Florida’s orange industry was booming, and citrus barons got rich on the backs of cheap Jim Crow labor. To maintain order and profits, they turned to Willis V. McCall, a violent sheriff who ruled Lake County with murderous resolve. When a white seventeen-year-old Groveland girl cried rape, McCall was fast on the trail of four young blacks who dared to envision a future for themselves beyond the citrus groves. By day’s end, the Ku Klux Klan had rolled into town, burning the homes of blacks to the ground and chasing hundreds into the swamps, hell-bent on lynching the young men who came to be known as “the Groveland Boys.”And so began the chain of events that would bring Thurgood Marshall, the man known as “Mr. Civil Rights,” into the deadly fray. Associates thought it was suicidal for him to wade into the “Florida Terror” at a time when he was irreplaceable to the burgeoning civil rights movement, but the lawyer would not shrink from the fight—not after the Klan had murdered one of Marshall’s NAACP associates involved with the case and Marshall had endured continual threats that he would be next.Drawing on a wealth of never-before-published material, including the FBI’s unredacted Groveland case files, as well as unprecedented access to the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund files, King shines new light on this remarkable civil rights crusader, setting his rich and driving narrative against the heroic backdrop of a case that U.S. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson decried as “one of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to American justice.”",0062097717,9780062097712),ebook,,434 pages,"

Within twenty-four hours a reporter receives an anonymous letter that points out alarming similarities between the murder and Jack the Ripper’s first murder—a letter that calls out Lacey by name. If it’s real, and they have a killer bent on re-creating London’s bloody past, history shows they have just five days until the next attempt.No one believes the connections are anything more than a sadistic killer’s game, not even Lacey, whom the killer seems to be taunting specifically. However, as they investigate the details of the case start reminding her more and more of a part of her past she’d rather keep hidden. And the only way to do that is to catch the killer herself.",0312600526,9780312600525),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","Evelina, the first of Burney's novels, was published anonymously and brought her immediate fame. It tells the story of a young girl, fresh from the provinces, whose initiation into the ways of the world is frequently painful, though it leads to self-discovery, moral growth, and, finally, happiness. Hilarious comedy and moral gravity make the novel a fund of entertainment and wisdom. Out of the graceful shifts from the idyllic to the near-tragic and realistic, Evelina emerges as a fully realized character. And out of its treatment of contrasts - the peace of the countryside and the cultured and social excitement of London and Bristol, the crowd of life-like vulgarians and the elegant gentry - the novel reveals superbly the life and temper of eighteenth-century England, as seen through the curious eyes of its young heroine.

","Rock star, crowdfunding pioneer, and TED speaker Amanda Palmer knows all about asking. Performing as a living statue in a wedding dress, she wordlessly asked thousands of passersby for their dollars. When she became a singer, songwriter, and musician, she was not afraid to ask her audience to support her as she surfed the crowd (and slept on their couches while touring). And when she left her record label to strike out on her own, she asked her fans to support her in making an album, leading to the world's most successful music Kickstarter.Even while Amanda is both celebrated and attacked for her fearlessness in asking for help, she finds that there are important things she cannot ask for-as a musician, as a friend, and as a wife. She learns that she isn't alone in this, that so many people are afraid to ask for help, and it paralyzes their lives and relationships. In this groundbreaking book, she explores these barriers in her own life and in the lives of those around her, and discovers the emotional, philosophical, and practical aspects of The Art Of Asking.Part manifesto, part revelation, this is the story of an artist struggling with the new rules of exchange in the twenty-first century, both on and off the Internet. The Art Of Asking will inspire readers to rethink their own ideas about asking, giving, art, and love.",1455581089,9781455581085),Hardcover,,339 pages,"

For all Teddy endures in battle, his greatest challenge will be to face living in a future he never expected to have.This gripping, often deliriously funny yet emotionally devastating book looks at war – that great fall of Man from grace – and the effect it has, not only on those who live through it, but on the lives of the subsequent generations. It is also about the infinite magic of fiction.Those who loved the bestselling Life After Life will recognise Teddy as Ursula Todd’s adored younger brother – but for those who have not read it, A God in Ruins stands fully on its own. Few will dispute that it proves once again that Kate Atkinson is one of the most exceptional novelists of our age.",,,Paperback,,552 pages,"

","On June 17, 1940 William L. Shirer stood in the streets of Paris and watched the unending flow of gray German uniforms along its boulevards. In just six lovely weeks in the spring and summer of 1940 a single battle brought down in total military defeat one of the world's oldest, greatest, and most civilized powers—the second mightiest empire on earth and the possessor of one of the finest military machines ever assembled. How did it happen? After nearly a decade of research in the massive archives left from World War II and after hundreds of conversations with the Third Republic's leaders, generals, diplomats, and ordinary citizens, Shirer presents the definitive answer in his stunning re-creation of why and how France fell before Hitler's armies in 1940. His book is also a devastating examination of the confusion, corruption, and cynicism that drained the strength and toughness of a democracy which Thomas Jefferson once called ""every man's second country."" This book complements and completes the dramatic story of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and continues to rank as one of the most important works of history of our time.",0306805626,9780306805622),Paperback,,1082 pages,"

","Alternate cover edition can be found here. At first sight, Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets.But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so?In the end, you will see, there is something about Ove that is quite irresistible...The word-of-mouth bestseller causing a sensation across Europe, Fredrik Backman's heartwarming debut is a funny, moving, uplifting tale of love and community that will leave you with a spring in your step - and less ready to judge on first impressions a man you might one day wish to have as your dearest friend.",1444775812,9781444775815),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Cleo Connelly siempre quiso ser como su hermana Leslie. Por eso, cuando decidió trabajar para la Ley, Cleo la siguió y se esforzó siempre por llegar a su nivel. Pero solo Leslie fue aceptada en el FBI, mientras que Cleo tuvo que conformarse con patrullar su ciudad natal: Nueva Orleans.Ahora, Leslie ha desaparecido. El subdirector del departamento del FBI ha visitado a Cleo para pedirle que les ayude y colabore en su misión rescate, puesto que necesitan un perfil parecido al de su hermana. La joven policía, llevada por el miedo y la desesperación, accederá a hacerlo antes de entender en qué tipo de misión estaba Leslie metida: ¿Un Rol llamado Dragones y mazmorras DS? ¿Diseño de drogas afordisíacas? ¿BDSM? ¿Red de trata de personas? ¡¡¿¿BDSM?!! Si antes le hubieran explicado que tendrían que instruírla para hacerla pasar por sumisa, puede que la respuesta fuera otra… ¿Sumisa? ¡¿Ella?! ¡Pero si su resistencia al dolor era nula y pegaba a la que le hacía las manicuras! ¿Cómo iba a hacerse pasar por…? Maldita sea. Por supuesto que sí. Por su hermana haría cualquier cosa. Un momento… ¿Había dicho el inspector que su “master” iba a ser Lion? ¡¡¿¿Lion Romano??!! ¡Lo retiraba! El atractivo y arisco Lion Romano está devastado por la muerte de su mejor amigo Clint, encontrado muerto mientras trabajaba de encubierto en la misión de la trata de blancas en la que se hallaba inmerso junto con Leslie Connelly, una de las mejores agentes del FBI, cuyo paradero se hallaba desconocido. Lion hará lo posible por recuperar a Leslie, y si para ello debe infiltrarse en el rol de BDSM con la sexy, inconsciente y descarada de su hermana Cleo, el sacrificio merecería la pena. Lo que nadie sabía era que someter e instruir a Cleo en el arte de la dominación y la sumisión, era algo que deseaba hacer desde que la joven cumplió su mayoría de edad. Ambos se enrolarán en una aventura llena de peligro y sensualidad, crudeza y crueldad, en la que las fustas y los látigos marcan la realidad y el día a día. Una poli con vocación de agente especial que no se cree sumisa está a punto de conocer al AMO que está destinado a someterla.¿Lograrán salvar a Leslie antes de que se maten entre ellos? ¿El trabajo se puede mezclar con el placer? Los juegos están servidos: los dragones salen de sus mazmorras.Esta historia se divide en dos partes. La Doma de Cleo a manos de Lion, que se localiza en la gran y oscura Nueva Orleans y en la que se descubren el uno al otro en sus roles, y después, el intenso y apasionante torneo de dominación y sumisión de Dragones y Mazmorras DS.No hay margen para el aburrimiento.

","The name is French and it has connections to German expressionist cinema, but film noir was inspired by the American Raymond Chandler, whose prose was marked by the gripping realism of seedy hotels, dimly lit bars, main streets, country clubs, mansions, cul-de-sac apartments, corporate boardrooms, and flop houses of America. Chandler and the other writers and directors, including James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, Jane Greer, Ken Annakin, Rouben Mamoulian and Mike Mazurki, who were primarily responsible for the creation of the film noir genre and its common plots and themes, are the main focus of this work. It correlates the rise of film noir with the new appetites of the American public after World War II and explains how it was developed by smaller studios and filmmakers as a result of the emphasis on quality within a deliberately restricted element of cities at night. The author also discusses how RKO capitalized on films such as Murder, My Sweet and Out of the Past--two of film noir's most famous titles--and film noir's connection to British noir and the great international triumph of Sir Carol Reed in The Third Man.",0786416297,9780786416295),Paperback,,211 pages,"

","For the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris’s new book is a guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.From multiple New York Times bestselling author, neuroscientist, and “new atheist” Sam Harris, Waking Up is for the 30 percent of Americans who follow no religion, but who suspect that Jesus, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history could not have all been epileptics, schizophrenics, or frauds. Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experiences of such contemplatives—and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.Waking Up is part seeker’s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris—a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic—could write it.",1451636016,9781451636017),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

The ruthless Grand Duke Orso is locked in a vicious struggle with the squabbling League of Eight, and between them they have bled the land white. While armies march, heads roll and cities burn, and behind the scenes bankers, priests and older, darker powers play a deadly game to choose who will be king.War may be hell but for Monza Murcatto, the Snake of Talins, the most feared and famous mercenary in Duke Orso's employ, it's a damn good way of making money too. Her victories have made her popular - a shade too popular for her employer's taste. Betrayed, thrown down a mountain and left for dead, Murcatto's reward is a broken body and a burning hunger for vengeance. Whatever the cost, seven men must die.Her allies include Styria's least reliable drunkard, Styria's most treacherous poisoner, a mass-murderer obsessed with numbers and a Northman who just wants to do the right thing. Her enemies number the better half of the nation. And that's all before the most dangerous man in the world is dispatched to hunt her down and finish the job Duke Orso started...Springtime in Styria.

","Alternate cover edition can be found hereA vividly imagined fantasy of court intrigue and dark magics in a steampunk-inflected world, by a brilliant young talent.The youngest, half-goblin son of the Emperor has lived his entire life in exile, distant from the Imperial Court and the deadly intrigue that suffuses it. But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an ""accident,"" he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir.Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an attempt on his life at any moment.Surrounded by sycophants eager to curry favor with the naïve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while, he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend... and hoping for the possibility of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest he lose his throne – or his life.This exciting fantasy novel, set against the pageantry and color of a fascinating, unique world, is a memorable debut for a great new talent.",,,Kindle Edition,,447 pages,"

","Morbid obsessions with sex, germs, or with one's appearance, and uncontrollable compulsions to hoard objects, to check and recheck locks, or to pull one's hair are just a few of the symptoms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders, which afflict over ten million Americans. Many suffer in isolation, not knowing that their disorder has a name, how to seek help, or how to help themselves.  Dr. Penzel discusses the entire spectrum of these disorders, from the classic form characterized by intrusive, repetitive, and often unpleasant thoughts, to body dysmorphic disorder (""imagined ugliness""), trichotillomania (compulsive hair pulling), compulsive skin picking, and nail biting. He takes the reader through each step of the most effective behavioral therapies, detailing how progress is made and how to avoid relapse. He also offers a completely up-to-date discussion of medication--how it is used as part of the overall treatment, its effect on pregnancy, how to choose the best medicine, and how to know if it is working. In addition, Dr. Penzel discusses the treatment of children with these disorders, offers helpful advice for the families of sufferers, and lists sources of help and information (including the latest sites on the Internet).",0195140923,9780195140927),Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel, published just before his death in 1881, chronicles the bitter love-hate struggle between the outsized Fyodor Karamazov and his three very different sons. It is above all the story of a murder, told with hair-raising intellectual clarity and a feeling for the human condition unsurpassed in world literature.Dostoevsky’s towering reputation as one of the handful of thinkers who forged the modern sensibility has sometimes obscured the purely novelistic virtues–brilliant characterizations, flair for suspense and melodrama, instinctive theatricality–that made his work so immensely popular in nineteenth-century Russia. 

This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky–the definitive version in English–magnificently captures the rich and subtle energies of Dostoevsky’s masterpiece.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)",0679410031,9780679410034),Hardcover,,976 pages,"

","Virginia Woolf's Orlando 'The longest and most charming love letter in literature', playfully constructs the figure of Orlando as the fictional embodiment of Woolf's close friend and lover, Vita Sackville-West. Spanning three centuries, the novel opens as Orlando, a young nobleman in Elizabeth's England, awaits a visit from the Queen and traces his experience with first love as England under James I lies locked in the embrace of the Great Frost. At the midpoint of the novel, Orlando, now an ambassador in Constantinople, awakes to find that he is a woman, and the novel indulges in farce and irony to consider the roles of women in the 18th and 19th centuries. As the novel ends in 1928, a year consonant with full suffrage for women.

","Books 1 and 2 of the Valkyrie Series - Historical adventure of piracy, love and revenge in the Caribbean in the seventeenth century. ILL WIND: Gabriella Berryngton is an unhappy and oppressed fourteen-year-old girl living in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1683. She dreams of escaping her bitter, ambitious stepfather and sailing off into the unknown. Her dreams come true when her stepfather sells her into marriage. Aboard Freyja, she is hopeful that her new life in the Dutch West Indies will be an improvement – a hope that dies when she is given a slave, Klara, and a whip. She discovers that her soon-to-be father-in-law is a ruthless slave trader in league with pirates, and her fiancé is cold, unfriendly and disinterested in Gabriella. She is little more than a vessel to provide the next generation of van Eckens. Largely ignored and desperately unhappy, she and Klara develop a friendship which makes life bearable – at first. Once married, Gabriella’s life takes a turn for the worse and she descends into a world of horror and abuse until tensions finally explode. Life will never be the same and she has no choice but to take fate into her own hands. DEAD RECKONING: Leo is born in Spanish Panama in 1659. When he is twelve years old he witnesses the violent rape and murder of his mother by three of the Caribbean’s most feared pirates: Tarr, Blake and Hornigold, and swears revenge at all costs. Gabriella is trapped in an abusive marriage to a ruthless Dutch slave trader, who is in business with the same English cut-throats. She risks all to escape with her life. Leo and Gabriella meet aboard one of the most horrific ships in the Caribbean – a slaver – and join forces against their common enemy. They face a number of challenges as they battle not only the dangers of a life at sea, including storm, drowning, and being cast adrift in a crippled ship, but also repeated attacks by Blake and Hornigold. But their biggest threat proves to be each other. Can they reconcile their hearts in time for the fiercest battle in their quest of revenge, and survive the gallows?

","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERContinuing the series that began with A Blaze of Glory,  Jeff Shaara returns to chronicle another decisive chapter in America's long and bloody Civil War. In A Chain of Thunder,  the action shifts to the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There, in the vaunted ""Gibraltar of the Confederacy,"" a siege for the ages will cement the reputation of one Union general--and all but seal the fate of the rebel cause.In May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton's army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. But after sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low. Grant reluctantly decides to lay siege to the city, trapping soldiers and civilians alike inside an iron ring of Federal entrenchments. Six weeks later, the starving and destitute Southerners finally surrender, yielding command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces on July 4--Independence Day--and marking a crucial turning point in the Civil War.Drawing on comprehensive research and his own intimate knowledge of the Vicksburg Campaign, Jeff Shaara once again weaves brilliant fiction out of the ragged cloth of historical fact. From the command tents where generals plot strategy to the ruined mansions where beleaguered citizens huddle for safety, this is a panoramic portrait of men and women whose lives are forever altered by the siege. On one side stand the emerging legend Grant, his irascible second William T. Sherman, and the youthful ""grunt"" Private Fritz Bauer; on the other, the Confederate commanders Pemberton and Joseph Johnston, as well as nineteen-year-old Lucy Spence, a civilian doing her best to survive in the besieged city. By giving voice to their experiences at Vicksburg, A Chain of Thunder vividly evokes a battle whose outcome still reverberates more than 150 years after the cannons fell silent.",0345527380,9780345527387),Hardcover,,562 pages,"

","LONGLISTED 2015  – International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award The Circle is the exhilarating new novel from Dave Eggers, bestselling author of A Hologram for the King, a finalist for the National Book Award. When Mae Holland is hired to work for the Circle, the world’s most powerful internet company, she feels she’s been given the opportunity of a lifetime. The Circle, run out of a sprawling California campus, links users’ personal emails, social media, banking, and purchasing with their universal operating system, resulting in one online identity and a new age of civility and transparency. As Mae tours the open-plan office spaces, the towering glass dining facilities, the cozy dorms for those who spend nights at work, she is thrilled with the company’s modernity and activity. There are parties that last through the night, there are famous musicians playing on the lawn, there are athletic activities and clubs and brunches, and even an aquarium of rare fish retrieved from the Marianas Trench by the CEO. Mae can’t believe her luck, her great fortune to work for the most influential company in the world—even as life beyond the campus grows distant, even as a strange encounter with a colleague leaves her shaken, even as her role at the Circle becomes increasingly public. What begins as the captivating story of one woman’s ambition and idealism soon becomes a heart-racing novel of suspense, raising questions about memory, history, privacy, democracy, and the limits of human knowledge.From the Hardcover edition.",0345808592,9780345808592),Paperback,,498 pages,"

","Schnitzler beschreibt in dieser Novelle die scheinbar harmonische Ehe des Arztes Fridolin und seiner Frau Albertine. Unter der Oberfläche werden beide von ungestillten erotischen Begierden und Träumen heimgesucht, die zu einer Folge merkwürdiger und gefährlicher Ereignisse führen. Fridolin taucht ein ins Dunkel der Großstadt - wird er wieder herausfinden? Das Geheimnisvolle dieser Novelle rührt - neben der krimihaften Spannung - auch von der Entdeckungsreise ins Selbst her, die Fridolin unternimmt, einen Abstieg in die Tiefen seiner eigenen Psyche, und zugleich handelt es von den Machenschaften einer dubiosen Geheimgesellschaft. Die Novelle ist ein Glücksfall: literarisch erstklassig und spannend zugleich. Verfilmt in abgewandelter Form von S. Kubrick.",,,Kindle Edition,,102 pages,"

Ten years later she was still trying to protect Selah from the world.  Selah learned the hard way, life was harder then just missing a party or two. Sixteen and recovering from trauma, Selah thought the worst had past.  But there was something going on. Times when she could hear voices. Whispers. Selah was sure she was going crazy. How else could she explain what was happening. Her dreams were nothing but nightmares and she wanted to confide in her sister. But secrets were reveling themselves.

","Lively reminiscences of bandit warfare in the sertao, the still primitive Brazilian back country, told by a wise, retired outlaw chief. ~Worldcat.orgGrande Sertão: Veredas (Portuguese for ""Great Backlands: Tracks""; English translation: The Devil to Pay in the Backlands) is a novel published in 1956 by the Brazilian writer João Guimarães Rosa.The original title refers to the veredas - small paths through wetlands usually located at higher altitudes characterized by the presence of grasses and buritizais, groups of the buriti palm-tree (Mauritia flexuosa), that criss-cross the Sertão region in northern Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil - as a labyrinthine net where an outsider can easily get lost, and where there is no single way to a certain place, since all paths interconnect in such a way that any road can lead anywhere. The English title refers to a later episode in the book involving an attempt to make a deal with the Devil. Most of the book's spirit is however lost in translation, as the Portuguese original is written in a register that is both archaic and colloquial, making it a very difficult book to translate. The combination of its size, linguistic oddness and polemic themes caused a shock when it was published, but now it is considered one of the most important novels of South American literature.In a 2002 poll of 100 noted writers conducted by Norwegian Book Clubs, the book was named among the top 100 books of all time.",,,,,469 pages,"

","Come definire una storia come questa? A prima vista potrebbe sembrare un romanzo fantastico, ma forse sfugge a ogni possibile definizione. Tabucchi l’ha sottotitolato “Un mandala”, ma a ben vedere, con criteri tutti occidentali, si tratta in fin dei conti di un’inchiesta, una ricerca che sembra condotta da un Philip Marlowe metafisico. Ma con la metafisica, in questa ricerca spasmodica e pellegrina, si sposa un concetto tutto terrestre della vita: sapori, odori, luoghi, città, fotografie che sono legati al nostro immaginario, ai nostri sogni, ma anche alla nostra quotidiana esperienza. E allora? Nella sua nota Tabucchi suggerisce di pensare a un monaco vestito di rosso, a Hölderlin e a una canzone napoletana. Potranno forse sembrare degli ingredienti incongrui. Ma forse è meglio non cercare la congruenza in uno dei più stravaganti, visionari e insieme struggenti romanzi che la letteratura italiana ci abbia mai regalato.",8807030632,9788807030635),Paperback,I Narratori,128 pages,"

","Women of the Dawn tells the stories of four remarkable Wabanaki Indian women who lived in northeast America during the four centuries that devastated their traditional world. Their courageous responses to tragedies brought on by European contact make up the heart of the book. The narrative begins with Molly Mathilde (1665-1717), a mother, a peacemaker, and the daughter of a famous chief. Born in the mid-1600s, when Wabanakis first experienced the full effects of colonial warfare, disease, and displacement, she provided a vital link for her people through her marriage to the French baron of St. Castin. The sage continues with the shrewd and legendary healer Molly Ockett (1740-1816) and the reputed witchwoman Molly Molasses (1775-1867). The final chapter belongs to Molly Dellis Nelson (1903-1977) (known as Spotted Elk), a celebrated performer on European stages who lived to see the dawn of Wabanaki cultural renewal in the modern era.",080328277X,9780803282773),Paperback,,152 pages,"

","A thousand years ago, two young lovers were betrayed-Alger Waterlow to his death, and Hanalea, Queen of the Fells, to a life without love. Now, once again, the Queendom of the Fells seems likely to shatter apart. For young queen Raisa ana'Marianna, maintaining peace even within her own castle walls is nearly impossible; tension between wizards and Clan has reached a fevered pitch. With surrounding kingdoms seeking to prey on the Fells' inner turmoil, Raisa's best hope is to unite her people against a common enemy. But that enemy might be the person with whom she's falling in love.Through a complicated web of lies and unholy alliances, former streetlord Han Alister has become a member of the Wizard Council of the Fells. Navigating the cut-throat world of blue blood politics has never been more dangerous, and Han seems to inspire hostility among Clan and wizards alike. His only ally is the queen, and despite the perils involved, Han finds it impossible to ignore his feelings for Raisa. Before long, Han finds himself in possession of a secret believed to be lost to history, a discovery powerful enough to unite the people of the Fells. But will the secret die with him before he can use it? A simple, devastating truth concealed by a thousand-year-old lie at last comes to light in this stunning conclusion to the Seven Realms series.",142315214X,9781423152149),Paperback,,598 pages,"

","Há mais de 20 semanas entre os mais vendidos do New York Times!Durante os últimos dois anos, uma jovem transformou quase todos os aspectos de sua vida. Parou de fumar, correu uma maratona e foi promovida. Em um laboratório, neurologistas descobriram que os padrões dentro do cérebro dela ou seja, seus hábitos foram modificados de maneira fundamental para que todas essas mudanças ocorressem. Há duas décadas pesquisando ao lado de psicólogos, sociólogos e publicitários, cientistas do cérebro começaram finalmente a entender como os hábitos funcionam ¿ e, mais importante, como podem ser transformados. Embora isoladamente pareçam ter pouca importância, com o tempo, têm um enorme impacto na saúde, na produtividade, na estabilidade financeira e na felicidade. Com base na leitura de centenas de artigos acadêmicos, entrevistas com mais de trezentos cientistas e executivos, além de pesquisas realizadas em dezenas de empresas, o repórter investigativo do New York Times Charles Duhigg elabora, em O poder do hábito, um argumento animador: a chave para se exercitar regularmente, perder peso, educar bem os filhos, se tornar uma pessoa mais produtiva, criar empresas revolucionárias e ter sucesso é entender como os hábitos funcionam. Transformá-los pode gerar bilhões e significar a diferença entre fracasso e sucesso, vida e morte. Duhigg conclui por que algumas pessoas e empresas têm tanta dificuldade em mudar, enquanto outras o fazem da noite para o dia. Descobre, por exemplo, como hábitos corretos foram cruciais para o sucesso do nadador Michael Phelps, do diretor executivo da Starbucks, Howard Schultz, e do herói dos direitos civis, Martin Luther King, Jr.: ""Eles tiveram êxito transformando hábitos. Todos começam com um padrão psicológico. Primeiro, há uma sugestão, ou gatilho, que diz ao seu cérebro para entrar em modo automático e desdobrar um comportamento. Depois, há a rotina, que é o comportamento em si. Para alterar um hábito, é preciso modificar os padrões que moldam cada aspecto de nossas vidas. Entendendo isso, você ganha a liberdade ¿ e a responsabilidade ¿ para começar a trabalhar e refazê-los"", diz o autor.Um dos exemplos citados pelo autor diz respeito a ele próprio. Duhigg explica como conseguiu parar de consumir cookies no meio do dia de trabalho ao compreender o hábito que o levava diariamente a uma cafeteria para comê-los, mesmo sem fome ¿ as visitas diárias ao lugar ocorriam por necessidade de socialização. ""Refiz o hábito e, agora, pelas 15h30, levanto da minha mesa e procuro alguém para conversar por 10 minutos. E não como um cookie há seis meses"", conta ele. A prática é um dos segredos para a mudança: ""Tarefas que parecem incrivelmente complexas no início, como aprender a tocar violão e falar uma língua estrangeira, podem se tornar muito mais fáceis depois de executadas inúmeras vezes. Maus hábitos, como fumar e beber demais, são superados quando aprendemos novas rotinas e a praticamos incessantemente. ""Há ainda, segundo Duhigg, os chamados ""hábitos mestres"", capazes de desencadear uma série de reações no modo da pessoa organizar sua própria vida. Um bom exemplo de um hábito mestre é o exercício físico.""Quando as pessoas começam a se exercitar regularmente, começam a mudar outros comportamentos que não estão relacionados à atividade física. Passam a comer melhor e a levantar da cama mais cedo. Fumam menos e se tornam mais pacientes. (...) Não está completamente claro porque isso ocorre, mas está provado que exercício é um hábito mestre, que propaga mudanças em todos os aspectos da vida.""",,,Paperback,,407 pages,"

","Hope Unseen challenges readers to question their doubts, not their beliefs, and depend upon God no matter what—the inspiring true story of “blind” faith.A nervous glance from a man in a parked car. Muted instincts from a soldier on patrol. Violent destruction followed by total darkness. Two weeks later, Scotty Smiley woke up in Walter Reed Army Medical Center, helpless . . . and blind.  Blindness became Scotty’s journey of supreme testing. As he lay helpless in the hospital, Captain Smiley resented the theft of his dreams—becoming a CEO, a Delta Force operator, or a four-star general. With his wife Tiffany’s love and the support of his family and friends, Scotty was transformed—the injury only intensifying his indomitable spirit. Since the moment he jumped out of a hospital bed and forced his way through nurses and cords to take a simple shower, Captain Scotty Smiley has climbed Mount Rainier, won an ESPY as Best Outdoor Athlete, surfed, skydived, become a father, earned an MBA from Duke, taught leadership at West Point, commanded an army company, and won the MacArthur Leadership Award. Scotty and Tiffany Smiley have lived out a faith so real that it will inspire you to question your own doubts, push you to serve something bigger than yourself, and encourage you to cling to a Hope Unseen.",1439186820,9781439186824),ebook,,256 pages,"

","Vem da Suécia um dos maiores êxitos no gênero de mistério dos últimos anos: a trilogia Millennium - da qual este romance, Os homens que não amavam as mulheres, é o primeiro volume. Seu autor, Stieg Larsson, jornalista e ativista político muito respeitado na Suécia, morreu subitamente em 2004, aos cinqüenta anos, vítima de enfarte, e não pôde desfrutar do sucesso estrondoso de sua obra. Seus livros não só alcançaram o topo das vendas nos países em que foram lançados (além da própria Suécia, onde uma em cada quatro pessoas leu pelo menos um exemplar da série, a Alemanha, a Noruega, a Itália, a Dinamarca, a França, a Espanha, a Itália, a Espanha e a Inglaterra), como receberam críticas entusiasmadas.O motivo do sucesso reside em vários fronts. Um deles é a forma original com que Larsson engendra a trama, fazendo-a percorrer variados aspectos da vida contemporânea, da ciranda financeira feita de corrupção à invasão de privacidade, da violência sexual contra as mulheres aos movimentos neofascistas e ao abuso de poder de uma maneira geral. Outro é a criação de personagens extremamente bem construídos e originais, como a jovem e genial hacker Lisbeth Salander, magérrima, com o corpo repleto de piercings e tatuagens e comportamento que beira a delinqüência. O terceiro é a maestria em conduzir a narrativa, repleta de suspense da primeira à última página.Os homens que não amavam as mulheres é um enigma a portas fechadas - passa-se na circunvizinhança de uma ilha. Em 1966, Harriet Vanger, jovem herdeira de um império industrial, some sem deixar vestígios. No dia de seu desaparecimento, fechara-se o acesso à ilha onde ela e diversos membros de sua extensa família se encontravam. Desde então, a cada ano, Henrik Vanger, o velho patriarca do clã, recebe uma flor emoldurada - o mesmo presente que Harriet lhe dava, até desaparecer. Ou ser morta. Pois Henrik está convencido de que ela foi assassinada. E que um Vanger a matou. Quase quarenta anos depois, o industrial contrata o jornalista Mikael Blomkvist para conduzir uma investigação particular. Mikael, que acabara de ser condenado por difamação contra o financista Wennerström, preocupa-se com a crise de credibilidade que atinge sua revista, a Millennium. Henrik lhe oferece proteção para a Millennium e provas contra Wennerström, se o jornalista consentir em investigar o assassinato de Harriet. Mikael descobre que suas inquirições não são bem-vindas pela família Vanger, e que muitos querem vê-lo pelas costas. De preferência, morto. Com o auxílio de Lisbeth Salander, que conta com uma mente infatigável para a busca de dados - de preferência, os mais sórdidos -, ele logo percebe que a trilha de segredos e perversidades do clã industrial recua até muito antes do desaparecimento ou morte de Harriet. E segue até muito depois.... até um momento presente, desconfortavelmente presente.",853592616X,9788535926163),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","Melisandra balancea sus piernas sobre el río que corre lentamente junto a la hacienda de su abuelo. Aguarda, con la calma propia de los habitantes de Fagua, la llegada anual de los contrabandistas que traerán las últimas noticias del mundo. Pero esta vez con ellos llega un forastero desconocido que le propone emprender juntos la aventura con la que siempre soñó.  Siguiendo el curso del río, internándose en la selva, dos jóvenes emprenden un viaje para encontrar Waslala, el paraíso en cuya búsqueda se perdieron los padres de Melisandra, un lugar utópico y legendario que parece haberse esfumado, dejando tan sólo la huella de un ideal imposible, un sueño maravilloso grabado en el recuerdo de unos pocos.  Gioconda Belli recrea uno de los mitos que acompañan al hombre desde el origen del pensamiento: la búsqueda de la Utopía. Y lo hace a través de una historia tremendamente envolvente y sensual que nos transporta a un futuro no tan lejano del que sólo el amor y la imaginación pueden redimirnos. Con cientos de miles de lectores en diferentes lenguas y en todo el mundo, Waslala es una novela llena de magia que se lee, se recomienda y se recuerda con verdadera pasión..",8432296783,9788432296789),Paperback,,344 pages,"

","From the dawn of the twentieth century to the devastation of World War II, this exhilarating novel of love, war, art, and family gives voice to two extraordinary women and brings to life the true story behind the creation and near destruction of Gustav Klimt’s most remarkable paintings.In the dazzling glitter of 1903 Vienna, Adele Bloch-Bauer—young, beautiful, brilliant, and Jewish—meets painter Gustav Klimt. Wealthy in everything but freedom, Adele embraces Klimt’s renegade genius as the two awaken to the erotic possibilities on the canvas and beyond. Though they enjoy a life where sex and art are just beginning to break through the façade of conventional society, the city is also exhibiting a disturbing increase in anti-Semitism, as political hatred foments in the shadows of Adele’s coffee house afternoons and cultural salons.Nearly forty years later, Adele’s niece Maria Altmann is a newlywed when the Nazis invade Austria—and overnight, her beloved Vienna becomes a war zone. When her husband is arrested and her family is forced out of their home, Maria must summon the courage and resilience that is her aunt’s legacy if she is to survive and keep her family—and their history—alive.Will Maria and her family escape the Nazis’ grip? And what will become of the paintings that her aunt nearly sacrificed everything for?Impeccably researched and a “must-read for fans of Kristin Hannah’s The Nightingale and Paula McLain’s Circling the Sun” (Christina Baker Kline, #1 New York Times bestselling author), Stolen Beauty intertwines the tales of two remarkable women across more than a hundred years. It juxtaposes passion and discovery against hatred and despair, and shines a light on our ability to love, to destroy, and above all, to endure.",1501131990,9781501131998),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","In this lyrical, exuberant follow-up to her 2007 novel, The Bastard of Istanbul, acclaimed Turkish author Elif Shafak unfolds two tantalizing parallel narratives—one contemporary and the other set in the thirteenth century, when Rumi encountered his spiritual mentor, the whirling dervish known as Shams of Tabriz—that together incarnate the poet's timeless message of love.Ella Rubenstein is forty years old and unhappily married when she takes a job as a reader for a literary agent. Her first assignment is to read and report on Sweet Blasphemy, a novel written by a man named Aziz Zahara. Ella is mesmerized by his tale of Shams's search for Rumi and the dervish's role in transforming the successful but unhappy cleric into a committed mystic, passionate poet, and advocate of love. She is also taken with Shams's lessons, or rules, that offer insight into an ancient philosophy based on the unity of all people and religions, and the presence of love in each and every one of us. As she reads on, she realizes that Rumi's story mir­rors her own and that Zahara—like Shams—has come to set her free.",0141047186,9780141047188),Paperback,,355 pages,"

","The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred worlds, interconnected by a web of transport “tunnels” known as wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a star . . . vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him. Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship’s mission for its own ends. Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted.

","Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. (1985) score redefined video game music. With under three minutes of music, Kondo put to rest an era of bleeps and bloops-the sterile products of a lab environment-replacing it with one in which game sounds constituted a legitimate form of artistic expression. Andrew Schartmann takes us through the various external factors (e.g., the video game crash of 1983, Nintendo's marketing tactics) that coalesced into a ripe environment in which Kondo's musical experiments could thrive. He then delves into the music itself, searching for reasons why our hearts still dance to the “primitive” 8-bit tunes of a bygone era.What musical features are responsible for Kondo's distinct “Mario sound”? How do the different themes underscore the vastness of Princess Peach's Mushroom Kingdom? And in what ways do the game's sound effects resonate with our physical experience of the world? These and other questions are explored within, through the lens of Kondo's compositional philosophy-one that would influence an entire generation of video game composers. As Kondo himself stated, “we [at Nintendo] were trying to do something that had never been done before.” In this book, Schartmann shows his readers how Kondo and his team not just succeeded, but heralded in a new era of video games.",1628928530,9781628928532),Paperback,,168 pages,"

","16 hrs and 16 minsRichard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally best-selling, now classic, volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.©1989 Richard Dawkins (P)2011 Audible, Inc.",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged Audiobook,16 pages,"

After her identity is revealed during the Inundation, Princess Wilhelmina is kept prisoner by the Indigo Kingdom, with the Ospreys lost somewhere in the devastated city. When the Ospreys’ leader emerges at the worst possible moment, leaving Wil’s biggest ally on his deathbed, she must become Black Knife to set things right.  HER MAGIC IS UNCONTROLLABLE. Wil’s power is to animate, not to give true life, but in the wraithland she commanded a cloud of wraith mist to save herself, and later ordered it solid. Now there is a living boy made of wraith—destructive and deadly, and willing to do anything for her. HER HEART IS TORN. Though she’s ready for her crown, declaring herself queen means war. Caught between what she wants and what is right, Wilhelmina realizes the throne might not even matter. Everyone thought the wraith was years off, but already it’s destroying Indigo Kingdom villages. If she can’t protect both kingdoms, soon there won’t be a land to rule. In this stunning conclusion to THE ORPHAN QUEEN, Jodi Meadows follows Wilhelmina’s breathtaking and brave journey from orphaned criminal on the streets to magic-wielding queen.",0062317415,9780062317414),Hardcover,,531 pages,"

Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism, Kafka's nightmare has resonated with chilling truth for generations of readers. This new edition is based upon the work of an international team of experts who have restored the text, the sequence of chapters, and their division to create a version that is as close as possible to the way the author left it.In his brilliant translation, Breon Mitchell masterfully reproduces the distinctive poetics of Kafka's prose, revealing a novel as full of energy and power as when it was first written.",0805209999,9780805209990),Paperback,,276 pages,"

For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister—unseen by most and unspoken of by all.The Red Queen’s grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth—drinker, gambler, seducer of women—is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it’s all a rumor—nothing that will affect him—but he is wrong.After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: he and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war—and the Red Queen controls the board.",0425268780,9780425268780),Hardcover,,355 pages,"

","IN PIONEER NEBRASKA, A WOMAN LEADS WHERE NO MAN WILL GOSoon to be a major motion picture directed by Tommy Lee Jones, The Homesman is a devastating story of early pioneers in 1850s American West. It celebrates the ones we hear nothing of: the brave women whose hearts and minds were broken by a life of bitter hardship. A “homesman” must be found to escort a handful of them back East to a sanitarium. When none of the county’s men steps up, the job falls to Mary Bee Cuddy—ex-teacher, spinster, indomitable and resourceful. Brave as she is, Mary Bee knows she cannot succeed alone. The only companion she can find is the low-life claim jumper George Briggs. Thus begins a trek east, against the tide of colonization, against hardship, Indian attacks, ice storms, and loneliness—a timeless classic told in a series of tough, fast-paced adventures.In an unprecedented sweep, Glendon Swarthout’s novel won both the Western Writers of America’s Spur Award and the Western Heritage Wrangler Award. A new afterword by the author’s son Miles Swarthout tells of his parents Glendon and Kathryn’s discovery of and research into the lives of the oft-forgotten frontier women who make The Homesman as moving and believable as it is unforgettable.",1501102877,9781501102875),Paperback,,256 pages,"

Who took her—and why didn’t Harry realize that something was amiss? Suddenly, a man steeped in failure has found a purpose, retracing the strange, twisting route that led to Heather’s vanishing. But the more he learns, the less he knows. Until Harry finds himself at the heart of a dangerous puzzle whose pieces are scattered everywhere: in the realm of British politics, in the beds of adulterous lovers, in the past, the present, and most of all, amid the secrets of a killer....",0385339194,9780385339193),Paperback,,498 pages,"

It's only been ten years since the end, but it feels like a hundred for Emma, who has been alone since the beginning, surviving on the skills her crazy father forced on her. Trust no one. Pull the trigger. Hide. Run. Stay away from the other survivors. Stay away from the Infected. She has obeyed her father's rules since she can remember running from the car accident that claimed his life. But one night that all changes. The knock at her cabin door and voice of the girl on the other side don't make Emma help the girl. No-it's the fact that the girl, Anna, is willing to die to save her wounded brother that changes everything in Emma's world. Emma finds friends and family in Anna and her brother Jake. She feels things that she thought she never would. But like her Granny always said, ""Everything comes at a cost. You must decide what you are willing to pay."" For Emma, that decision comes as Anna is stolen and taken to the breeder farms. Emma knows that she will pay anything to get Anna back, including her own life.",149451009X,9781494510091),Audio CD,,,"

If your parents loved you enough to erase you, who would you become? 
You are not your body. You’re not your hair, your eyes or your nose. You’re not your diseases, your anxieties, or your psychosis. Welcome to Astor Academy where, with the right genetic coding and a stomach for the impossible, you can change not only your body but the very course of your life…Thrust into the sexy, ultra-elite social scene, sixteen year old Savannah Van Duyn starts Astor Academy armed with only her sarcasm, a survivalist’s wit and her father’s promise that the school’s geneticist can fix her many problems at the DNA level. The foremost expert in genetic engineering, however, is teeming with so much dark secrecy it has Savannah’s skin crawling. What begins as a bold promise of genetic therapy becomes a life-threatening search for morality in an immoral cure, and an obsession to right the wrongs heaped upon her and those students who have died before her. Swann is the first in this groundbreaking debut series of young adult novels. Prepare yourself for an unabashed, unapologetic look into today’s YA world, namely: coping with a body fit for shame, crazy mothers on meds, the notion that there’s a pill for every problem, bullying and cyberbullying, the ebb and flow of first love and all things humorous, sick and twisted. In the spirit of balance, however, Swann explores the allure of friendship, the resolve of the desperate soul to find light inside the darkness, and one girl’s path to redemption in the face of insurmountable odds. And so begins the story of the ugly duckling becoming the swan…Note to Reader: Before you read or purchase this book, be sure to read the short author interview below. Due to mature content, Swann is recommended for ages 15 and up.


INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR



Q – How would you categorize the Swann Series?
A – The Swann series doesn’t sit firmly in one particular genre. This is the journey of a less than average girl who is inexplicably changed through the world of fringe science and genetics. This daring new series blends solid plotting with depth of character to produce a fun, laugh out loud, bigger than life story that not only triggers a myriad of interesting emotions, but it does so in a world that acknowledges today’s most relevant social and family issues. The truth is, I’m enamored with badass heroines, bullies and super creepy villains, as well as intriguing, slightly out of the box stories, the kind that lead down strange, often unsettling roads! To address the original question, if there were a BIGGER THAN LIFE category encompassing body image issues, genetic modification and the entanglements of family, social media, friendship and the difficulties of first love, that’s where you’d find this series.


Q – Why should readers give the series a try?
A – When I frequent my favorite steak house, I always order the same thing: filet minion, mashed potatoes, veggies. There’s safety in the known. In the world of fiction, I love vampires, dystopian landscapes, the paranormal and dark conspiracies. When I eat at other restaurants, however, I’m more adventurous in my choice of meals. The Swann series is that kind of a series: a bold departure from the known, a larger than life tale of one girl’s plunge into uncharted waters.",,,Kindle Edition,,320 pages,"

Then he shows up in the prison writing class I have to teach, and he blows me away with his honesty. He tells me secrets in his stories, and it’s getting harder to hide mine. I shiver when he gets too close, with only the cuffs and the bars and the guards holding him back. At night I can’t stop thinking about him in his cell.But that’s the thing about an animal in a cage—you never know when he’ll bite. He might use you to escape. He might even pull you into a forest and hold a hand over your mouth so you can’t call for the cops. He might make you come so hard, you can’t think.And you might crave him more than your next breath.",,,Kindle Edition,,386 pages,"

","We’re Supernatural Protection & Investigations, known as SPI. Things that go bump in the night, the monsters you thought didn’t exist? We battle them and keep you safe. But some supernatural baddies are just too big to contain, even for us…   When I moved to New York to become a world famous journalist, I never imagined that snagging a job at a seedy tabloid would change my career path from trashy reporter to undercover agent. I’m Makenna Fraser, a Seer for SPI. I can see through any disguise, shield, or spell that a paranormal pest can come up with. I track down creatures and my partner, Ian Byrne, takes them out—usually saving my skin in the process.   Our cases are generally pretty routine, but a sickle-wielding serial killer has been prowling the city’s subway tunnels. And the murderer’s not human. The fiend in question, a descendant of Grendel—yes, that Grendel—shares his ancestor’s hatred of parties, revelry, and drunkards. And with New Year’s Eve in Times Square only two days away, we need to bag him quickly. Because if we don’t find him—and the organization behind him—by midnight, our secret’s out and everyone’s time is up.",0425266915,9780425266915),Mass Market Paperback,,292 pages,"

","Some like Farah Khan and Zoya Akhtar had sterling antecedents but it took a tough childhood and intermittent assignments on film sets to win the box office with Om Shanti Om and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; while Ashutosh Gowarikar auditioned for folk dances and failed with his debut film, Lagaan created cinematic history; and Anurag Basu had to first dance as a background extra and later overcome cancer to witness Barfi win hearts and awards. These and other hitherto unfamiliar stories of directors belonging to the 100 crore club like Rohit Shetty and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra; the adventurous Kabir Khan; and the maverick, Mahesh Bhatt take us through the unusual lives of 15 filmmakers of extraordinary films.  Sonia Golani achieves the incredible by sitting each director down to candidly discuss the hype around the Oscars; the exclusivity of the 100 crore club ; effect of corporatization and much more. Decoding Bollywood is more about demystifying the world of Bollywood than a mere decoding of 15 directors who have created benchmarks in their respective genres for generations to follow.",9384030309,9789384030308),Paperback,,202 pages,"

","Miller didn't just inhabit Paris, he devoured it. Not the Paris of the guidebooks, but the City of Light's lurid backways and backwaters, the dens of vice where he could slough off the pale cast of American puritanism and embrace the hedonistic facts of life. The Parisian life of Miller was a turbulent quest for new sensations and avenues, a roisterous, slumming exploration of the soul. This world Miller shared with Brassai, one of the greatest photographers of our century. Miller and Brassai's friendship was a recognition of kindred spirits, born of mutual admiration for each other's tireless, restless fascination with Paris and its inhabitants. In Miller, Brassai found his most compelling subject. Using unpublished letters, recollected conversations, and references to Miller's workand featuring sixteen unforgettable examples of Brassai's photography""Henry Miller: The Paris Years"" is an intimate account of a writer's self-discovery, seen through the unblinking eye of a master photographer. Brassai delves into Miller's relationships with Anais Nin and Lawrence Durrell, as well as his hopelessly tangled though wildly inspiring marriage to June. Brassai remembers Miller's favorite cafes and haunts, revives Miller's idols and anathemas, and evokes their shared passion for the street life of a Montparnasse and Montmartre captured, even during those depression years, in a dazzling moment of illumination.",1559703474,9781559703475),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.When Jack St. Bride arrives by chance in the sleepy New England town of Salem Falls, he decides to reinvent himself. Tall, blond, and handsome, Jack was once a beloved teacher and soccer coach at a girls' prep school -- until a student's crush sparked a powder keg of accusation and robbed him of his reputation. Now, working for minimum wage washing dishes for Addie Peabody at the Do-Or-Diner, Jack buries his past, content to become the mysterious stranger who has appeared out of the blue. With ghosts of her own haunting her, Addie Peabody is as cautious around men as Jack St. Bride is around women. But as this unassuming stranger steps smoothly into the diner's daily routine, she finds him fitting just as comfortably inside her heart -- and slowly, a gentle, healing love takes hold between them. Yet planting roots in Salem Falls may prove fateful for Jack. Amid the white-painted centuries-old churches, a quartet of bored, privileged teenage girls have formed a coven that is crossing the line between amusement and malicious intent. Quick to notice the attractive new employee at Addie's diner, the girls turn Jack's world upside down with a shattering allegation that causes history to repeat itself -- and forces Jack to proclaim his innocence once again. Suddenly nothing in Salem Falls is as it seems: a safe haven turns dangerous, an innocent girl meets evil face-to-face, a dishwasher with a Ph.D. is revealed to be an ex-con. As Jack's hidden past catches up with him, the seams of this tiny town begin to tear, and the emerging truth becomes a slippery concept written in shades of gray. Now Addie, desperate for answers, must look into her heart -- and into Jack's lies and shadowy secrets -- for evidence that will condemn or redeem the man she has come to love.",0340835532,9780340835531),Paperback,,472 pages,"

","1984 (tytuł oryginalny: Nineteen Eighty-Four) – futurystyczna antyutopia o licznych podtekstach politycznych, napisana przez George’a Orwella i opublikowana w roku 1949. Autor napisał ją pod wpływem kontaktu z praktyczną stroną ideologii komunistycznej, do jakiego po raz pierwszy doszło w Hiszpanii w 1938 roku (w czasie wojny domowej), gdzie pojechał jako dziennikarz i sympatyk strony republikańskiej.Pierwsze polskie tłumaczenie - Juliusza Mieroszewskiego opublikowane zostało na emigracji w Instytucie Literackim w Paryżu w roku 1953. Do upadku ustroju komunistycznego w Polsce (1989) była to powieść zakazana przez cenzurę, od roku 1980 była jednak publikowana w postaci przedruków z wydania paryskiego w wydawnictwach niezależnych - tzw. ""drugiego obiegu"". Wszystkie wydania krajowe oficjalne od 1988 r. ukazały się w tłumaczeniu Tomasza Mirkowicza.Do kultury masowej przeniknęły pewne pojęcia z tej powieści np. Wielki Brat (ang.

As Parisians flee the city, human folly surfaces in every imaginable way: a wealthy mother searches for sweets in a town without food; a couple is terrified at the thought of losing their jobs, even as their world begins to fall apart. Moving on to a provincial village now occupied by German soldiers, the locals must learn to coexist with the enemy—in their town, their homes, even in their hearts.When Irène Némirovsky began working on Suite Française, she was already a highly successful writer living in Paris. But she was also a Jew, and in 1942 she was arrested and deported to Auschwitz, where she died. For sixty-four years, this novel remained hidden and unknown.",,,Kindle Edition,,448 pages,"

","Winner of the 1985 National Book Award, White Noise tells the story of Jack Gladney, professor of Hitler Studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America, where his colleagues include New York expatriates who want to immerse themselves in ""American magic and dread."" Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the usual rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism, sleepwalking through a world where ""Coke Is It!"" and the TV is always on.Then a lethal black chemical cloud floats over their lives, an ""airborne toxic event"" unleashed by an industrial accident. The menacing cloud is a more urgent and visible version of the ""white noise"" engulfing the Gladney family—radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, ultrasonic appliances, and TV murmurings—pulsing with life yet heralding the danger of death.With its ironic, satirical telling vision of the anxieties, absurdities, and mysteries of modern American life, White Noise is a masterpiece at once illuminating and darkly prophetic.",0140077022,9780140077025),Paperback,CAN / USA,326 pages,"

","Beyond your waking life and tucked gently between your slumbering eyes and the heart of your soul, there lies the Sherbet Shore. The land where it is located is called Dræm; it’s past Rælity and a bit to the left of the Sea of Hope. In this magical land, it’s not that dreams come true; it’s that we become our dreams. There’s the Kung-Fu Circus, the Parched Pumpkin, the Down Pond and dozens of other places that we discover and create, one wonder at a time. You can drink Curiosity Cola, taste Peppermint Rain or simply enjoy a ride on a dragon ship, a kangaroo, or glide across fields on soapy skates. So feel free to drop on by. After all, life is just a dream. J.D. Estrada is a Puerto Rican author who writes novels, poetry collections and connects with people through all sorts of social media platforms and his blog For Writing Out Loud. This is his first collection of young adult short stories and his tribute to the healing and unifying power of dreams and the joys of embracing our inner children.",1511698454,9781511698450),Paperback,1,92 pages,"

","Růže pro Algernon si poprvé získaly čtenáře jako slavná povídka, která se dočkala uvedení v nesčetných antologiích a byla přeložena do mnoha jazyků. Stejně úspěšná byla i jako televizní inscenace - a nakonec jako celovečerní film s názvem Charly. Pak Daniel Keyes svůj znepokojivý příběh rozšířil a zbydlel dalšími postavami, takže vznikl román, který obdržel od asociace Science Fiction Writers of America cenu Nebula za nejlepší sci-fi roku. Fascinující příběh o odvážném (snad až příliš odvážném) experimentu s lidskou inteligencí popsal jeden kritik jako „milostný trojúhelník tvořený dvěma lidmi“. Jiné nadchla jeho obraznost, napětí nebo lidskost. Růže pro Algernon v sobě spojují všechny tyto kvality. Je to jeden z nejoriginálnějších a zároveň nejcitlivějších románů naší doby.",8024201976,9788024201979),Hardcover,,236 pages,"

","The summer of 1914. The Sheridan brothers pursue the pastimes of the rich and talented in the idyllic village of Tarrant Royal, unaware of the coming war that will test their courage and family loyalty to the limit. Roland, an aspiring surgeon, believes his duty lies in remaining as squire of his Dorset village. But charges of cowardice force him into a conflict his conscience cannot condone. Rex, a womanizer and daredevil aviator, dons the RFC uniform. As time passes and he becomes an ace over the skies of France he knows that one day soon his luck must run out. Chris, a brilliant scholar about to enter university, is driven to enlist by a scandal which shatters his golden future. Hopelessly unfitted for battle, he faces the carnage of Gallipoli not caring whether he lives or dies. In Elizabeth Darrell's richly detailed, mesmeric novel the Sheridans live, love and fight for survival like the sons of all families caught up in a savage war which changed the old ways forever. ‘Moving romance’ - Yorkshire Evening Post ‘A wonderful story, compellingly told…the authenticity - both historical and emotional - really shines through’ - Sarah Harrison Elizabeth Darrell served as an officer in the WRAC. She is the author of seven acclaimed novels, including ‘Concerto’, ‘And in the Morning’ and ‘We Will Remember’. Under the pen-name Emma Drummond she has written eleven historical novels.

","Winner of the Hugo and Nebula AwardsIn order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",,,Kindle Edition,,226 pages,"

","È il 1939 nella Germania nazista. Tutto il Paese è col fiato sospeso. La Morte non ha mai avuto tanto da fare, ed è solo l'inizio.Il giorno del funerale del suo fratellino, Liesel Meminger raccoglie un oggetto seminascosto nella neve, qualcosa di sconosciuto e confortante al tempo stesso, un libriccino abbandonato lì, forse, o dimenticato dai custodi del minuscolo cimitero. Liesel non ci pensa due volte, le pare un segno, la prova tangibile di un ricordo per il futuro: lo ruba e lo porta con sé. Così comincia la storia di una piccola ladra, la storia d'amore di Liesel con i libri e con le parole, che per lei diventano un talismano contro l'orrore che la circonda. Grazie al padre adottivo impara a leggere e ben presto si fa più esperta e temeraria: prima strappa i libri ai roghi nazisti perché «ai tedeschi piaceva bruciare cose. Negozi, sinagoghe, case e libri», poi li sottrae dalla biblioteca della moglie del sindaco, e interviene tutte le volte che ce n'è uno in pericolo. Lei li salva, come farebbe con qualsiasi creatura. Ma i tempi si fanno sempre più difficili. Quando la famiglia putativa di Liesel nasconde un ebreo in cantina, il mondo della ragazzina all'improvviso diventa più piccolo.

But when she ends up meeting Red, a spirited homeless girl only a few years older than she is, Molly makes it her mission to reunite her with her family in time for Christmas. This turns out to be extremely difficult—because Red refuses to talk about her past. There are things Molly won’t talk about either. Like the awful thing that happened last winter. She may never be ready to talk about that. Not to Red, or to Cristo, the soulful boy she meets while riding the Ferris wheel one afternoon. When Molly realizes that the friends who Red keeps mentioning are nothing more than voices inside Red’s head, she becomes even more concerned about her well-being. How will Molly keep her safe until she can figure out a way to get Red home?

Zack lost his job, his apartment, and his hope, which is why he ends up on the roof of a high rise, certain that one final step will solve his problems. But a mysterious stranger named Rob happens to be on the roof that night too. He talks Zack down, convincing him there's still hope left in the world. Zack thinks maybe he's right, which is why he's shocked when he turns on the news the next morning to find out Rob jumped himself. Disturbed and confused, he searches for answers, starting with Rob’s brother Tommy Rayburn.  It’s been Tommy’s job to take care of his brother since they were kids, taking the blows from their father so Rob wouldn’t have to. Tommy thought he could protect him, even if it meant carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Considering Rob threw himself off a building, he obviously couldn't.  Then he meets Zack, a friend of Rob’s who’s suspiciously evasive about how they knew each other. But they’re both grieving and determined to find out why Rob jumped. Answers don’t come easily, and soon they’re soothing each other with sweat-slicked, passionate encounters. Hot as things get in the bedroom, it doesn’t take them long to realize there’s more between them than mind-blowing sex and their pain. But the heaviness is still there, threatening to pull them under, and if they can’t open up with each other to lighten the load, the weight just might be enough to crush them both.",,,Kindle Edition,,281 pages,"

The men and women in these eight short fictions grasp this truth on an elemental level, and their stories, as told by James Baldwin, detail the ingenious and often desperate ways in which they try to keep their head above water. It may be the heroin that a down-and-out jazz pianist uses to face the terror of pouring his life into an inanimate instrument. It may be the brittle piety of a father who can never forgive his son for his illegitimacy. Or it may be the screen of bigotry that a redneck deputy has raised to blunt the awful childhood memory of the day his parents took him to watch a black man being murdered by a gleeful mob.By turns haunting, heartbreaking, and horrifying--and informed throughout by Baldwin's uncanny knowledge of the wounds racism has left in both its victims and its perpetrators--Going to Meet the Man is a major work by one of our most important writers.",0679761799,9780679761792),Paperback,First Vintage International,249 pages,"

","Thrilling, heartbreaking, and, at times, absurdly funny, The Last Resort is a remarkable true story about one family in a country under siege and a testament to the love, perseverance, and resilience of the human spirit. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, Douglas Rogers is the son of white farmers living through that country’s long and tense transition from postcolonial rule. He escaped the dull future mapped out for him by his parents for one of adventure and excitement in Europe and the United States. But when Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe launched his violent program to reclaim white-owned land and Rogers’s parents were caught in the cross fire, everything changed. Lyn and Ros, the owners of Drifters–a famous game farm and backpacker lodge in the eastern mountains that was one of the most popular budget resorts in the country–found their home and resort under siege, their friends and neighbors expelled, and their lives in danger. But instead of leaving, as their son pleads with them to do, they haul out a shotgun and decide to stay. On returning to the country of his birth, Rogers finds his once orderly and progressive home transformed into something resembling a Marx Brothers romp crossed with Heart of Darkness: pot has supplanted maize in the fields; hookers have replaced college kids as guests; and soldiers, spies, and teenage diamond dealers guzzle beer at the bar. And yet, in spite of it all, Rogers’s parents–with the help of friends, farmworkers, lodge guests, and residents–among them black political dissidents and white refugee farmers–continue to hold on. But can they survive to the end? In the midst of a nation stuck between its stubborn past and an impatient future, Rogers soon begins to see his parents in a new light: unbowed, with passions and purpose renewed, even heroic. And, in the process, he learns that the ""big story"" he had relentlessly pursued his entire adult life as a roving journalist and travel writer was actually happening in his own backyard.",0307407977,9780307407979),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","In Supersymmetry and Beyond, renowned physicist Gordon Kane tells the epic story of the quest to uncover a fully unified theory of physics. He introduces the theory of supersymmetry, which implies that each of the fundamental particles has a ""superpartner"" that can be detected at energies and intensities only now being achieved in the giant accelerators. If the theory is correct, these superpartners will also help solve many of the puzzles of modern physics—such as the existence of the Higgs boson—as well as one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology: the notorious ""dark matter"" of the universe.An absorbing narrative of science in the making, Supersymmetry and Beyond, now fully updated to reflect recent discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider, offers a glimpse of the cutting edge in one of the most exciting scientific ventures of our times.",0465082971,9780465082971),Paperback,Revised Edition,197 pages,"

Until one day a letter appears, summoning him to the frozen woods of Vermont. There, Ricky is inducted into a band of paranormal investigators comprised of former addicts and petty criminals, all of whom had at some point in their wasted lives heard The Voice: a mysterious murmur on the wind, a disembodied shout, or a whisper in an empty room that may or may not be from God.Evoking the disorienting wonder of writers like Haruki Murakami and Kevin Brockmeier, but driven by Victor LaValle’s perfectly pitched comic sensibility, Big Machine is a mind-rattling literary adventure about sex, race, and the eternal struggle between faith and doubt.",0385527985,9780385527989),Hardcover,,370 pages,"

It's everything I do.Sarah Wilson—bestselling author and entrepreneur, intrepid solver of problems and investigator of how to live a better life—has helped over 1.2 million people across the world to quit sugar. She has also been an anxiety sufferer her whole life.In her new book, she directs her intense focus and fierce investigatory skills onto this lifetime companion of hers, looking at the triggers and treatments, the fashions and fads. She reads widely and interviews fellow sufferers, mental health experts, philosophers, and even the Dalai Lama, processing all she learns through the prism her own experiences.Sarah pulls at the thread of accepted definitions of anxiety, and unravels the notion that it is a difficult, dangerous disease that must be medicated into submission. Ultimately, she re-frames anxiety as a spiritual quest rather than a burdensome affliction, a state of yearning that will lead us closer to what really matters.Practical and poetic, wise and funny, this is a small book with a big heart. It will encourage the myriad sufferers of the world's most common mental illness to feel not just better about their condition, but delighted by the possibilities it offers for a richer, fuller life.",1743535864,9781743535868),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","In the nonfiction tradition of John Berendt (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) and Erik Larson (The Devil in the White City), New York Times bestselling author Douglas Preston presents a gripping account of crime and punishment in the lush hills surrounding Florence, Italy.In 2000, Douglas Preston fulfilled a dream to move his family to Italy. Then he discovered that the olive grove in front of their 14th century farmhouse had been the scene of the most infamous double-murders in Italian history, committed by a serial killer known as the Monster of Florence. Preston, intrigued, meets Italian investigative journalist Mario Spezi to learn more.This is the true story of their search for—and identification of—the man they believe committed the crimes, and their chilling interview with him. And then, in a strange twist of fate, Preston and Spezi themselves become targets of the police investigation. Preston has his phone tapped, is interrogated, and told to leave the country. Spezi fares worse: he is thrown into Italy's grim Capanne prison, accused of being the Monster of Florence himself. Like one of Preston's thrillers, The Monster of Florence, tells a remarkable and harrowing story involving murder, mutilation, and suicide—and at the center of it, Preston and Spezi, caught in a bizarre prosecutorial vendetta.",0446581194,9780446581196),Hardcover,,322 pages,"

A quest faces them both. Born in India, Kim is nevertheless white, a sahib. While he wants to play the Great Game of Imperialism, he is also spiritually bound to the lama.

","Wyatt Gwyon's desire to forge is not driven by larceny but from love. Exactingly faithful to the spirit and letter fo the Flemish masters, he produces uncannily accurate ""originals""--pictures the painters themselves might have envied. In an age of counterfeit emotion and taste, the real and fake have become indistinguishable; yet Gwyon's forgeries reflect a truth that others cannot touch--cannot even recognize. Contemporary life collapses the distinction between the ""real"" and the ""virtual"" world, and Gaddis' novel pre-empts our common obsessions by almost half a century. This novel tackles the blurring of perceptual boundaries.",1564786919,9781564786913),Paperback,,956 pages,"

And her life in the mountains of West Virginia seems like a fairy tale; her parents sing and dance with her, Cousin Nancy dotes on her, and she is about to get a new baby brother. But when the baby dies soon after he's born, taking Summer's mama with him, Summer's fairy-tale life turns grim. Things get even worse when her father marries a woman who brings poisons and magical mirrors into Summer's world. Stepmama puts up a pretty face, but Summer suspects she's up to no good - and is afraid she's powerless to stop her. This Snow White tale filled with magic and intrigue during the early twentieth century in Appalachia will be hard to forget.",0399256636,9780399256639),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

In the barren highlands they rebel against landlords, government officials, an international corporation and a mythical wire fence which devours their lands.

","Happily retired in the village of Three Pines, Armand Gamache, former Chief Inspector of Homicide with the Sûreté du Québec, has found a peace he’d only imagined possible. On warm summer mornings he sits on a bench holding a small book, The Balm in Gilead, in his large hands. ""There is a balm in Gilead,"" his neighbor Clara Morrow reads from the dust jacket, ""to make the wounded whole.""While Gamache doesn’t talk about his wounds and his balm, Clara tells him about hers. Peter, her artist husband, has failed to come home. Failed to show up as promised on the first anniversary of their separation. She wants Gamache’s help to find him. Having finally found sanctuary, Gamache feels a near revulsion at the thought of leaving Three Pines. ""There’s power enough in Heaven,"" he finishes the quote as he contemplates the quiet village, ""to cure a sin-sick soul."" And then he gets up. And joins her.Together with his former second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, and Myrna Landers, they journey deeper and deeper into Québec. And deeper and deeper into the soul of Peter Morrow. A man so desperate to recapture his fame as an artist, he would sell that soul. And may have. The journey takes them further and further from Three Pines, to the very mouth of the great St. Lawrence river. To an area so desolate, so damned, the first mariners called it The land God gave to Cain. And there they discover the terrible damage done by a sin-sick soul.",1250022061,9781250022066),Hardcover,,373 pages,"

","Mit Shakespearedramen ging es mir wie mit Schokoladenkeksen. Einmal probiert, konnte ich einfach nicht mehr aufhören. Eins nach dem anderen habe ich verschlungen. Wie meisterhaft sind seine Dramen aufgebaut -- Wie perfekt deutet jede Exposition das Geschehen der folgenden Akte an! Wie wundervoll die Sprache, die Bilder. Die Werke dieses genialsten aller Dichter sind einfach traumhaft und wohl auch deshalb am häufigsten gespielt und verfilmt. Besonders das Stück, das in der Johannisnacht spielt: Im Sommernachtstraum tummeln sich in der lauen, wundersamen Nacht allerlei Gestalten: edle Paare aus der höfischen Welt, einfache Handwerker, zauberhafte Wesen aus dem Reich der Elfen. Shakespeare verwebt diese unterschiedlichen Personenkreise überaus kunstvoll miteinander. Knüpft hier eine Verbindung zwischen zwei Liebenden, knotet dort eine Verwirrung in die Beziehung und löst am Ende alle verworrenen Fäden mit genialem Geschick zum Wohlgefallen aller wieder auf. Über 400 Jahre ist dieser Traum um verwirrte Liebende alt, und doch hat er nichts von seiner strahlenden Schönheit eingebüßt. Auch heute erfreut Puck, der Kobold, uns mit seinem Schabernack, läßt uns die anrührende Unbeholfenheit der Handwerker herzlich lachen, bangen wir mit den Liebenden, daß sich die richtigen Paare zusammenfinden mögen. Der Sommernachtstraum, eine Komödie über die Liebe, ist so voller turbulent komischer Szenen und wundersamer Einfälle, daß man zunächst gar nicht bemerkt, welch zynische Auffassung hier zugrunde liegt: Die Menschen sind den Launen der durch und durch amoralischen Elfenwesen wehrlos ausgeliefert. Und die Liebe ist nichts als Narrheit. Trieb, der nicht zu kontrollieren ist -- schon gar nicht mit Vernunft! Egal! Am Ende bleibt's ein wunderschöner Traum, den man am liebsten gleich noch einmal träumen möchte. --Anne Hauschild",3150000734,9783150000731),Paperback,,72 pages,"

","""I had an unusually large-sized head, though this was not uncommon for a baby in the Midwest. The craniums in our part of the country were designed to leave a little extra room for the brain to grow in case one day we found ourselves exposed to something we didn't understand, like a foreign language, or a salad."" Michael Moore-Oscar-winning filmmaker, bestselling author, the nation's unofficial provocateur laureate-is back, this time taking on an entirely new role, that of his own meta-Forest Gump. Breaking the autobiographical mode, he presents twenty-four far-ranging, irreverent, and stranger-than-fiction vignettes from his own early life. One moment he's an eleven-year-old boy lost in the Senate and found by Bobby Kennedy; and in the next, he's inside the Bitburg cemetery with a dazed and confused Ronald Reagan. Fast-forwarding to 2003, he stuns the world by uttering the words ""We live in fictitious times . . . with a fictitious president"" in place of the expected ""I'd like to thank the Academy."" And none of that even comes close to the night the friendly priest at the seminary decides to show him how to perform his own exorcism. Capturing the zeitgeist of the past fifty years, yet deeply personal and unflinchingly honest, HERE COMES TROUBLE takes readers on an unforgettable, take-no-prisoners ride through the life and times of Michael Moore. No one will come away from this book without a sense of surprise about the Michael Moore most of us didn't know. Alternately funny, eye-opening, and moving, it's a book he has been writing-and living-his entire life.",044653224X,9780446532242),Hardcover,,429 pages,"

Él es un einherjar, un guerrero de Odín que sufrió una grandísima traición a manos de la mujer que estaba destinada a ser su compañera eterna. La valkyria le pisoteó el corazón y, debido a ella, lo enviaron a la Tierra a proteger a los humanos; solo, con el alma destrozada y un odio latente en su interior. Carece de sentimientos, carece de miedo y su espíritu rezuma despecho y ansia por devolver el dolor sufrido. Ahora, tiene la posibilidad de obtener aquello que más anhela: someter a Bryn y hacerle pagar por partirle el corazón. Sin embargo, mientras se ciega en su furia, no solo podría perder de vista la misión de encontrar a Gungnir, la lanza de Odín; también podría perder el respeto de aquellos que le rodean y la oportunidad de recibir una explicación por parte de la Generala que podría cambiarlo todo. Pero, ¿cómo puede escuchar un hombre al que nada le ofende impunemente? Bryn La Salvaje lleva eones flagelándose por la decisión que tomó y que afectó de lleno a Ardan. Sus palabras lo alejaron de ella, rompieron su kompromiss y congelaron las alas de su einherjar, el hombre por el que hubiera dado su vida a ciegas. Las alas de ambos están heladas y azules. Pero ahora, ella y su ejército de valkyrias se encuentran en Escocia luchando por recuperar el último de los totems divinos de los dioses que fueron robados del Asgard. La Generala estará, contra su voluntad, en manos del duro highlander, pero no rendirá hasta demostrarle al escocés déspota y dominante que puede someter su cuerpo, pero nunca su alma ni su corazón. Una palabra de Ardan la devolvería al Valhall sin honores; y una pregunta del guerrero de ojos caramelo podría cambiar la relación entre ellos. ¿Le importará ella lo suficiente como para preguntarle por qué hizo lo que hizo? ¿Aprenderá Ardan que no se puede someter a alguien tan disciplinado y honorable como Bryn? El Midgard empieza temblar. La tierra se agrieta y de sus entrañas nace una terrible rebelión. Los portales se empiezan a activar uno detrás de otro y Gungnir, todavía extraviada, no debe clavarse en ninguno de ellos. La guerra está a la vuelta de la esquina. Pero no hay batalla más sangrienta que la que estalla entre dos guerreros de alas congeladas. El hielo seco de ella puede quemar tanto como el despachado fuego de él. Que arda el Midgard.",,,,,484 pages,"

","Neste livro a autora reimaginou a história da Guerra de Tróia e reconta-a do ponto de vista de Cassandra, a bela e atormentada princesa real de Tróia.Na sua brilhante recriação da famosa lenda, a queda de Tróia desenrola-se de uma nova e ousada maneira a partir do julgamento de Páris, do rapto de Helena (esta não sendo aqui a perversa adúltera da lenda, mas sim uma mulher afectuosa e dedicada a Páris e aos seus filhos), e do levantamento dos exércitos gregos por Agamemnon, cunhado enfurecido de Helena, até à tragédia final da destruição da cidade, predestinada pelos deuses e pelo obstinado orgulho dos seus líderes masculinos.A heroína deste conto épico é Cassandra, e a poderosa tensão do romance deriva tanto da luta interna, por ela travada, com as suas próprias lealdades divididas (visto que a sua lealdade ao pai, o rei, e aos irmãos é contraposta à sua submissão crescente à fé mais antiga no Matriarcado e na Terra-Mãe), como do amargo conflito entre Troianos e Gregosm no qual prevê fantasmagoricamente a destruição ou a maldição do tudo que lhe é querido, visto ter o poder da profecia.",9722900528,9722900528,Large Paperback,,564 pages,"

Hailed by critics as animating ""the grand sweep and the intimate details that bring the distant past vividly to life"" (Economist) in a way that makes ""your hair stand on end"" (Christian Science Monitor) and spanning nearly a thousand years of history, this ""highly informative, highly readable"" (Dallas Morning News) work examines not just how we think of ancient Rome but challenges the comfortable historical perspectives that have existed for centuries. With its nuanced attention to class, democratic struggles, and the lives of entire groups of people omitted from the historical narrative for centuries, SPQR will to shape our view of Roman history for decades to come.",1631492225,9781631492228),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","The Sith always betray one another. . . . I'm sure you'll learn that soon enough."" The overthrow of the Republic is complete. The Separatist forces have been smashed, the Jedi Council nearly decimated, and the rest of the Order all but destroyed. Now absolute power rests in the iron fist of Darth Sidious-the cunning Sith lord better known as the former Senator, now Emperor, Palpatine. But more remains to be done. Pockets of resistance in the galaxy must still be defeated and missing Jedi accounted for . . . and dealt with. These crucial tasks fall to the Emperor's ruthless enforcer, Darth Vader. In turn, the Dark Lord has groomed a lethal apprentice entrusted with a top-secret mission: to comb the galaxy and dispatch the last of his masters' enemies, thereby punctuating the dark side's victory with the Jedi's doom. Since childhood, Vader's nameless agent has known only the cold, mercenary creed of the Sith. His past is a void; his present, the carrying out of his deadly orders. But his future beckons like a glistening black jewel with the ultimate promise: to stand beside the only father he has ever known, with the galaxy at their feet. It is a destiny he can realize only by rising to the greatest challenge of his discipleship: destroying Emperor Palpatine. The apprentice's journeys will take him across the far reaches of the galaxy, from the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk to the junkyard planet of Raxus Prime. On these missions, the young Sith acolyte will forge an unlikely alliance with a ruined Jedi Master seeking redemption and wrestle with forbidden feelings for his beautiful comrade, Juno Eclipse. And he will be tested as never before-by shattering revelations that strike at the very heart of all he believes and stir within him long-forgotten hopes of reclaiming his name . . . and changing his destiny.""",0345499026,9780345499028),Hardcover,,319 pages,"

","Months after the Waterless Flood pandemic has wiped out most of humanity, Toby and Ren have rescued their friend Amanda from the vicious Painballers. They return to the MaddAddamite cob house, which is being fortified against man and giant Pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the Crakers, the gentle, quasi-human species engineered by the brilliant but deceased Crake. While their reluctant prophet, Jimmy -- Crake's one-time friend -- recovers from a debilitating fever, it's left to Toby to narrate the Craker theology, with Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her lover, Zeb.     Meanwhile, Zeb searches for Adam One, founder of the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance against the destructive CorpSeCorps. Now, under threat of an imminent Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four trotters.     At the centre, is the extraordinary story of Zeb's past, which involves a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, and a bizarre act of revenge.    Combining adventure, humour, romance, superb storytelling, and an imagination that is at once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world, MaddAddam is vintage Margaret Atwood, and a moving and dramatic conclusion to her internationally celebrated dystopian trilogy.",,,Kindle Edition,UK,416 pages,"

Once amused and satisfied, she returns to Kevin who welcomes her back with open arms hoping she?ll finally commit. But was there always more to Brenda than meets the eye?

","The subject of John Singer Sargent's most famous painting was twenty-three-year-old New Orleans Creole Virginie Gautreau, who moved to Paris and quickly became the ""it girl"" of her day. A relative unknown at the time, Sargent won the commission to paint her; the two must have recognized in each other a like-minded hunger for fame.Unveiled at the 1884 Paris Salon, Gautreau's portrait generated the attention she craved-but it led to infamy rather than stardom. Sargent had painted one strap of Gautreau's dress dangling from her shoulder, suggesting either the prelude to or the aftermath of sex. Her reputation irreparably damaged, Gautreau retired from public life, destroying all the mirrors in her home.Drawing on documents from private collections and other previously unexamined materials, and featuring a cast of characters including Oscar Wilde and Richard Wagner, Strapless is a tale of art and celebrity, obsession and betrayal.",158542336X,9781585423361),Paperback,,262 pages,"

","El narrador vio por primera vez a aquel hombre en 1971, o 1972, cuando Allende aún era presidente de Chile. Entonces se hacía llamar Ruiz-Tagle y se deslizaba con la distancia y la cautela de un gato por los talleres literarios de la universidad de Concepción. Escribía poemas también distantes y cautelosos, seducía a las mujeres, despertaba en los hombres una indefinible desconfianza. Volvió a verlo después del Golpe. Pero en esa ocasión el narrador aún ignoraba que aquel aviador, Wieder, que escribía con humor versículos de la Biblia con un avión de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y Ruiz-Tagle, el aprendiz de poeta, eran uno y el mismo.

","Katarina Bishop is a thief. To many it wouldn’t matter that she now uses her considerable skills to re-steal valuable works of art and return them to their rightful homes.  She’s still a thief.  So that’s why Kat’s surprised when an Interpol agent comes to her one snowy evening, asking for Kat’s help.  The Magi Miracle Network was set to auction off a very rare, very valuable Faberge egg two days before Christmas, but the egg’s been stolen and now the charity’s reputation—and their future—is on the line. Kat’s family and Interpol might be opposite sides of most jobs, but someone just stole Christmas.  Now it’s up to Kat and her crew to steal it back.  The Grift of the Magi is a Heist Society novella and is approximately half the length of the other novels in the series. It stands alone, but if you want read more about Kat and her crew check out Heist Society, Uncommon Criminals, and Perfect Scoundrels.",,,Kindle Edition,,105 pages,"

","Jane Zarse grew up the child of privilege in Lake Forest, Illinois. She attended a prestigious academy, drove a new Audi to school, and discovered the love of boys. She also discovered alcohol-which quickly became her crutch.In Love and Compassion Is My Religion, Zarse gives readers a heartfelt look at how she finally learned to love herself, climbing back from hitting bottom with the love of God. She fought bulimia and drank to excess after graduating from Boston University, then worked first as an actress and later as a high-volume trader at Chicago's Options Exchange. She lacked compassion for others, but didn't realize why until much later. The reason? She didn't love herself.But everything broke open after Zarse's mother died of a heart attack and she divorced her husband. At first the downward spiral was steep, but then she found the strength to pick herself up and finally seek help.Love and Compassion Is My Religion is a guide to finding your spiritual self-no matter how much you've sinned or lost yourself. It's a guide to how to find your way back. Zarse using her own excesses as an example, shows how it can be done.",151695095X,9781516950959),Paperback,,92 pages,"

It isn't something she's proud of, but the reluctant blackmailer needs the money to care for her gravely ill mother. To make up for her misdeeds, Anabelle keeps to a firm set of rules:• Never request payment from someone who cannot afford it.• Never reveal the secrets of a paying client.• Never enter into any form of social interaction with a client.Her list keeps her (somewhat) honest—until she encounters Owen Sherbourne, the Duke of Huntford. Not only does Owen nip Anabelle's extortion plans in the bud, the devilishly handsome Duke soon has the sexy seamstress dreaming of more than silks and satins. With Owen, Anabelle enjoys pleasures she never imagined . . . until a scandal from the past resurfaces. Now her rules could mean his family's ruin.

","The poetry and prose collected in Plainwater are a testament to the extraordinary imagination of Anne Carson, a writer described by Michael Ondaatje as ""the most exciting poet writing in English today."" Succinct and astonishingly beautiful, these pieces stretch the boundaries of language and literary form, while juxtaposing classical and modern traditions. Carson envisions a present-day interview with a seventh-century BC poet, and offers miniature lectures on topics as varied as orchids and Ovid. She imagines the muse of a fifteenth-century painter attending a phenomenology conference in Italy. She constructs verbal photographs of a series of mysterious towns, and takes us on a pilgrimage in pursuit of the elusive and intimate anthropology of water. Blending the rhythm and vivid metaphor of poetry with the discursive nature of the essay, the writings in Plainwater dazzle us with their invention and enlighten us with their erudition.",0375708421,9780375708428),Paperback,,260 pages,"

","من خلال توظيف المفهوم الخلدوني عن النشأة المستأنفة، بمعنى القطيعة والإستمرارية معاً، يسلط هذا الكتاب ضوءاً باهراً على عملية إعادة تأسيس الإسلام القرآني في إسلام حديثي، طرداً مع التحوّل من إسلام الرسالة إلى إسلام التاريخ، ومن إسلام ""أم القرى"" إلى إسلام الفتوحات.والخطورة لا تكمن فقط في هذه النقلة في المرجعية من القرآن إلى الحديث، بل أيضاً في تحوّل المكلّف في الإسلام إلى ما يشبه الإنسان الآلي الذي لا يتحرّك إلا بالنصوص التي تتحكم بشؤون حياته العامة والخاصة؛ فمع فرضية الشافعي القائلة بأن الرسول لا ينطق إلا عن وحي حتى عندما لا ينطق بالقرآن، أُنزلت الأحاديث التي وُضعت على لسان الرسول بعد وفاته منزلة الوحي، وتوافق أهل الحديث والفقه على إعتبار السنّة، كالقرآن، تشريعاً إلهياً متعالياً، ككل ما هو إلهي ومتعالٍ، تحرّرت السنّة وأحكامها من شروط المكان والزمان.وهذا ما حكم على العقل العربي الإسلامي بالإنكفاء على نفسه وبالمراوحة في مكانه في تكرار لا نهاية له؛ وهذا أيضاً ما سدّ عليه الطريق إلى إكتشاف مفهوم التطوّر وجدلية التقدّم وما يستتبعانه من تغيّر في الأحكام الوضعية ذات المصدر البشري لا الإلهي؛ وهذا ما أسّسه أخيراً في ممانعة للحداثة تنذر في يومنا هذا بالتحوّل إلى ردّة نحو قرون وسطى جديدة.بهذا الكتاب الذي يرصد الآليات الداخلية لإقالة العقل في الإسلام، يختتم المؤلّف مشروع ""نقد نقدِ العقل العربي"".",,,Paperback,الطبعة الأولى,643 pages,"

","O Livro 3 revela o estilo forte e truculento de uma personagem única, Ushikawa de seu nome. A par de Tengo e Aomame, a voz da Ushikawa ecoa nas páginas do terceiro volume de 1Q84 e provoca as reações mais intensas. Amem-no ou detestem-no, mas deixem-no entregue à sua sorte. Tengo e Aomame continuam sem saber, mas aquele é o único lugar perfeito no mundo. Um lugar perfeitamente isolado e, ao mesmo tempo, o único que escapa às malhas da solidão. Este mundo também deverá ter as suas ameaças, os seus perigos, claro, e estar cheio dos seus próprios enigmas e de contradições. Mas não faz mal. A páginas tantas, é preciso acreditar. Sob as duas luas de 1Q84, Aomame e Tengo deixam de estar sozinhos... Inspirado em parte no romance 1984, de George Orwell, 1Q84 é uma surpreendente obra de ficção, escrita de forma poderosa e imaginativa - a um tempo um thriller e uma tocante história de amor. Murakami continua a provocar o espanto e a emoção, comunicando com milhões de pessoas de todas as idades, espalhadas pelo mundo inteiro.

","I got the call. The dreaded call every child fears. My dad wasn’t well, and the man who had always been my everything needed me.  There was only one thing to do; pack up and head back to my hometown. I had finally made my dream life in the city with the great job and loving boyfriend. But was there really a choice not to go?  I found a wonderful job, a quaint house to rent, my boyfriend was working on joining me in Binghamton, and my favorite pizza place was only miles away. Life was good.  Until I met my neighbor.  It's been three years since I'd seen Aaron Walters, and my God is he all kinds of sexy gorgeous. Figures. He was supposed to be my forever, the man I grew old with, but he had different plans. How can a man who ripped my heart apart still trip me up? How can he make me still want him now more than ever?  I’m tempted, I’m drawn toward him, I’m completely and utterly unaware that I’m dating his biological brother.  Now two men own my heart. The question is, which brother will I choose?",,,Kindle Edition,,389 pages,"

","A new tour de force from the bestselling author of Free Food for Millionaires, for readers of A Fine Balance and Cutting for Stone. Profoundly moving and gracefully told, PACHINKO follows one Korean family through the generations, beginning in early 1900s Korea with Sunja, the prized daughter of a poor yet proud family, whose unplanned pregnancy threatens to shame them. Betrayed by her wealthy lover, Sunja finds unexpected salvation when a young tubercular minister offers to marry her and bring her to Japan to start a new life. So begins a sweeping saga of exceptional people in exile from a homeland they never knew and caught in the indifferent arc of history. In Japan, Sunja's family members endure harsh discrimination, catastrophes, and poverty, yet they also encounter great joy as they pursue their passions and rise to meet the challenges this new home presents. Through desperate struggles and hard-won triumphs, they are bound together by deep roots as their family faces enduring questions of faith, family, and identity.",1478976357,9781478976356),Audiobook,,18 pages,"

","Orphaned, raised by wolves, and the proud owner of a horned pig named Merlin, Weylyn Grey knew he wasn’t like other people. But when he single-handedly stopped that tornado on a stormy Christmas day in Oklahoma, he realized just how different he actually was.That tornado was the first of many strange events that seem to follow Weylyn from town to town, although he doesn’t like to take credit. As amazing as these powers may appear, they tend to manifest themselves at inopportune times and places. From freak storms to trees that appear to grow over night, Weylyn’s unique abilities are a curiosity at best and at worst, a danger to himself and the woman he loves. But Mary doesn’t care. Since Weylyn saved her from an angry wolf on her eleventh birthday, she’s known that a relationship with him isn’t without its risks, but as anyone who’s met Weylyn will tell you, once he wanders into your life, you’ll wish he’d never leave.Beasts of Extraordinary Circumstance tells the story of Weylyn Grey’s life from the perspectives of the people who knew him, loved him, and even a few who thought he was just plain weird. Although he doesn’t stay in any of their lives for long, he leaves each of them with a story to tell. Stories about a boy who lives with wolves, great storms that evaporate into thin air, fireflies that make phosphorescent honey, and a house filled with spider webs and the strange man who inhabits it.There is one story, however, that Weylyn wishes he could change: his own. But first he has to muster enough courage to knock on Mary’s front door.In this warm debut novel, Ruth Emmie Lang teaches us about adventure and love in a beautifully written story full of nature and wonder.",1250112044,9781250112040),Hardcover,,346 pages,"

","'Макар и да завършва с разгрома на подготвеното от комунистите септемврийско въстание - романът на Емилиян Станев не е роман за септемврийското въстание. И не само защото изобразява социалния и политически драматизъм на българската история в годините след Първата световна война в цялата им пълнота, а защото представя една много по-широка (от политическа хроника) епическа фреска на българския национален живот в неговата битова пълнота и екзистенциални многообразия. Като роман от типа роман-река, роман-епическа панорама, ""Иван Кондарев"" синтезира в себе си много и различи видове романи - и семейна сага (на Джупуните), и любовен роман (Кондарев - Христина - Костадин Джупуна), и множество други съставни - любовни, психологически и битови - новели, съсредоточени около различни герои (Христакиев, Анастаси Сиров, Корфонозов, Дуса, Балчев, д-р Янакиев, учителят Георгиев и др.). ""Иван Кондарев"", въпреки едноперсонажното си заглавие, е - редом с тетралогията на Талев - най-разгърнатият многоперсонажен роман в българската литература. Чрез образа на гимназиста Кольо Рачиков романът може да бъде четен дори като мемоарно-изповеден Bildungsrоman. При това, макар и опрян върху класически романови поетики от ХІХ век (преди всичко Толстой и Достоевски), романът на Станев представя не тяхно повторение, а модерен синтез - не е трудно да видим, че в ""Иван Кондарев"" се смесват повествувателните техники на Толстоевата изобразителна пластика и психологически анализ с полифоничния роман на идеите на Достоевски.' - Светлозар Игов",,,Hardcover,,808 pages,"

","Il libro è il tragico monologo di una donna che aspetta un figlio guardando alla maternità non come a un dovere ma come a una scelta personale e responsabile. Una donna di cui non si conosce né il nome né il volto né l'età né l'indirizzo: l'unico riferimento che ci viene dato per immaginarla è che vive nel nostro tempo, sola, indipendente e lavora. Il monologo comincia nell'attimo in cui essa avverte d'essere incinta e si pone l'interrogativo angoscioso: basta volere un figlio per costringerlo alla vita? Piacerà nascere a lui? Nel tentativo di avere una risposta la donna spiega al bambino quali sono le realtà da subire entrando in un mondo dove la sopravvivenza è violenza, la libertà un sogno, l'amore una parola dal significato non chiaro.",881715010X,9788817150101),Paperback,,101 pages,"

It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos.

","The link between Hitlerism and a millenarian, necessarily esoteric, and in any case suggestive tradition is a thesis that Miguel Serrano enunciated in Chile well before The Morning of the Magicians. After years of research, mystical experiences in India, and interviews with the most interesting personages of the 20th century—Hesse, Jung, Pound, Skorzeny, Degrelle—the author develops that primitive insight into a delirious exposition.Gnostics, Cathars, Rosicrucians, Templar Knights, Knights of the Thule Order, hidden leaders of National Socialism parade through the pages of this book, to be found in unexpected castles and monasteries, fighting astral battles whose echoes are recorded in history and which are won or lost in accordance to the direction of the swastika, a symbol that appears inexplicably in epics and cultures apparently alien to one another.Revelatory authors from the 1960s and 70s—Molnár, Bloch, Evola, Vögelin—have shown the nexus that links utopias, heresies, and secret societies to politics. Miguel Serrano, on the basis of documentation, abundant iconographic material, and unpublished testimonies applies the same methodology to National Socialism, with surprising and polemical results.This authoritative English-language edition—authorised by Miguel Serrano's estate and produced with their full collaboration and support—comes with a full complement of endnotes, a comprehensive index, and the author’s corrections, none of which were present in the two Spanish-language editions.",,,Hardcover,,462 pages,"

You could never tell that anything was wrong with me by just looking at me, as I dress clean and I keep myself tidy, and I have a smile on my face that hides my emotions and over the years I've become an expert at hiding behind it"" This is the shocking true story of an innocent girl abused by the very people who said they would take good care of her. Lilly's family began the path to her destruction - they used and abused her - but they never ever wanted or loved her. The little girl was sexually physically and emotionally abused by many people around her who were able to hide behind the security of Ireland's Catholic Church-run institutions. She also suffered at the hands of other people around them who they called their friends. You only get one chance to live your life as a child, but Lilly was never given that chance - her childhood was taken from her before it ever begun. From the age of four, when she was first sexually abused, her life changed forever; when she walked through the institution's doors in Ireland, her life continued along the same path that has destroyed her soul. Her emotional pain is as strong today as it was the day it began and will never leave her alone. ""When I go to sleep it's in my head and when I wake up I can see it in the mirror and I am only waiting to die."" A child abuse story that will stay with you forever and one that you will talk about for many years to come, The Girl Nobody Wants is a harrowing true story that will appeal to fans of biographies.",1780880332,9781780880334),Paperback,,248 pages,"

","In this highly original book, a bestseller in Germany, Norman Ohler investigates the murky, chaotic world of drug use in the Third Reich. There have been other books on Dr Morell's cocktail of treatments for Hitler and Goering's reliance on drugs, but Ohler's book is the first to show how the entire Nazi regime was permeated with drugs - cocaine, heroin, morphine and methamphetamines, the last of these crucial to troops' resilience and partly explaining German victory in 1940. Ohler is explicit that drugs cannot explain Third Reich ideology, but their promiscuous use impaired and confused decision-making, with drastic effects on Hitler and his entourage, who, as the war turned against Germany, took refuge in ever more poorly understood cocktails of stimulants. This chemical euphoria changes how we should think about the Nazi high command and its ability to understand the situation it found itself in by 1944-45. As such Blitzed will force a wider reinterpretation of several key events during the Second World War.",0241256992,9780241256992),Hardcover,,360 pages,"

","""At last, at last, at last, Pessoa again! More Pessoa! One of the very great poets of the twentieth century, again and more! And one of the fascinating figures of all literature, with his manifold identities, his amazing audacities, his brilliance and his shyness. I think I have under control the reluctance I feel in having to share Pessoa with the public he should have had all along in America: until now, only the poets, so far as I can tell, have even heard of him, and delighted and exulted in him. He is, in some ways, the poet of modernism, the only one willing to fracture himself into the parcels of action, anguish, and nostalgia which are the grounds of our actual situation."" —C. K. Williams""Pessoa is one of the great originals (a fact rendered more striking by his writing as several distinct personalities) of the European poetry of the first part of this century, and has been one of the last poets of comparable stature, in the European languages, to become known in English. Edwin Honig's translations of Spanish and Portuguese poetry have been known to anyone who cares about either, since his work on Lorca in the forties, and his Selected Poems of Pessoa (1971) was a welcome step toward a long-awaited larger colection."" — W. S. Merwin""Fernando Pessoa is the least known of the masters of the twentieth-century poetry. From his heteronymic passion he produced, if that is the word, two of our greatest poets, Alberto Caeiro and Álvaro de Campos, and a third, Ricardo Reis, who isn't bad. Pessoa is the exemplary poet of the self as other, of the poem as testament to unreality, proclamation of nothingness, occasion for expectancy. In Edwin Honig's and Susan Brown's superb translations, Pessoa and his ""others"" live with miraculous style and vitality."" —Mark StrandFernando Pessoa is Portugal’s most important contemporary poet. He wrote under several identities, which he called heteronyms: Albet Caeiro, Alvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, and Bernardo Soares. He wrote sublime poetry under his own name as well, and each of his “voices” is completely different in subject, temperament, and style. This volume brings back into print the comprehensive collection of his work published by Ecco Press in 1986.",0872863425,9780872863422),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","A skilled painter must stand up to the ancient power of the faerie courts—even as she falls in love with a faerie prince—in this gorgeous debut novel.Isobel is a prodigy portrait artist with a dangerous set of clients: the sinister fair folk, immortal creatures who cannot bake bread, weave cloth, or put a pen to paper without crumbling to dust. They crave human Craft with a terrible thirst, and Isobel’s paintings are highly prized. But when she receives her first royal patron—Rook, the autumn prince—she makes a terrible mistake. She paints mortal sorrow in his eyes—a weakness that could cost him his life. Furious and devastated, Rook spirits her away to the autumnlands to stand trial for her crime. Waylaid by the Wild Hunt’s ghostly hounds, the tainted influence of the Alder King, and hideous monsters risen from barrow mounds, Isobel and Rook depend on one another for survival. Their alliance blossoms into trust, then love—and that love violates the fair folks’ ruthless laws. Now both of their lives are forfeit, unless Isobel can use her skill as an artist to fight the fairy courts. Because secretly, her Craft represents a threat the fair folk have never faced in all the millennia of their unchanging lives: for the first time, her portraits have the power to make them feel.",1481497588,9781481497589),Hardcover,,300 pages,"

When Lucia starts hearing voices, it is Miranda who must find a way to reach her sister. Lucia impetuously plows ahead, but the bitter constant is that she is, in fact, mentally ill. Lucia lives life on a grand scale, until, inevitably, she crashes to earth.  Miranda leaves her own self-contained life in Switzerland to rescue her sister again—but only Lucia can decide whether she wants to be saved. The bonds of sisterly devotion stretch across oceans—but what does it take to break them? Everything Here Is Beautiful is, at its heart, an immigrant story, and a young woman’s quest to find fulfillment and a life unconstrained by her illness.

","A tender novel describing eager and inept young love, Daphnis and Chloe tells the story of a baby boy and girl who are discovered separately, two years apart, alone and exposed on a Greek mountainside. Taken in by a goatherd and a shepherd respectively, and raised near the town of Mytilene, they grow to maturity unaware of one another's existence - until the mischievous god of love, Eros, creates in them a sudden overpowering desire for one another. A masterpiece among early Greek romances, attracting both high praise and moral disapproval, this work has proved an enduringly fertile source of inspiration for musicians, writers and artists from Henry Fielding to Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Maurice Ravel. Longus transforms familiar themes from the romance genre - including pirates, dreams, and the supernatural - into a virtuoso love story that is rich in insight, humorous and ironical in its treatment of human sexual experience.",,,Paperback,,128 pages,"

As a patriotic epic imitating Homer, the Aeneid also set out to provide Rome with a literature equal to that of Greece. It tells of Aeneas, survivor of the sack of Troy, and of his seven-year journey: to Cartage, where he fell tragically in love with Queen Dido; then to the underworld, in the company of the Sibyl of Cumae; and finally to Italy, where he founded Rome. It is a story of defeat and exile, of love and war, hailed by Tennyson as 'the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of man'.David West's acclaimed prose translation is accompanied by an updated introduction, including a new discussion of each of the twelve books of the Aeneid.",0140449329,9780140449327),Paperback,Penguin Classics,290 pages,"

When Gloria sets out to spend the summer before her senior year at a camp for gifted and talented students, she doesn’t know quite what to expect. Fresh from the heartache of losing her grandmother and missing her best friend, Gloria resolves to make the best of her new circumstances. But some things are proving to be more challenging than she expected. Like the series of mysterious clues left by a certain Professor X before he even shows up to teach his class, Secrets of the Written Word. Or the very sweet, but very conservative, roommate whose coal-industry family champions mountaintop removal. Not to mention the obnoxious Mason, who dresses like the Mad Hatter and immediately gets on Gloria’s nerves — but somehow won’t escape her thoughts.

","The Princess Diarist is Carrie Fisher’s intimate, hilarious and revealing recollection of what happened behind the scenes on one of the most famous film sets of all time, the first Star Wars movie. When Carrie Fisher recently discovered the journals she kept during the filming of the first Star Wars movie, she was astonished to see what they had preserved—plaintive love poems, unbridled musings with youthful naiveté, and a vulnerability that she barely recognized. Today, her fame as an author, actress, and pop-culture icon is indisputable, but in 1977, Carrie Fisher was just a (sort-of) regular teenager.With these excerpts from her handwritten notebooks, The Princess Diarist is Fisher’s intimate and revealing recollection of what happened on one of the most famous film sets of all time—and what developed behind the scenes. And today, as she reprises her most iconic role for the latest Star Wars trilogy, Fisher also ponders the joys and insanity of celebrity, and the absurdity of a life spawned by Hollywood royalty, only to be surpassed by her own outer-space royalty. Laugh-out-loud hilarious and endlessly quotable, The Princess Diarist brims with the candour and introspection of a diary while offering shrewd insight into the type of stardom that few will ever experience.",0593077571,9780593077573),Paperback,,257 pages,"

","They tell me that my memory will never be the same, that I'll start forgetting things. At first just a little, and then a lot. So I'm writing to remember.Sammie was always a girl with a plan: graduate at the top of her class and get out of her small town as soon as humanly possible.

","BlurbHave you ever wondered if we choose our loved ones during our lifetime? Before or after that time? Do you ponder the meaning of your existence? Your destiny? What life would be like if your enemies or rivals didn’t exist at all? Brian Sunderland, whom some might call a “profound researcher,” has been looking for answers to these questions. In fact, his entire life so far has been ruled by this quest, as he journeys through various dilemmas, such as surrendering to true love, his coming of age, fighting, standing up for his rights, helping others, and finally, leaving his mark on this world. In stark contrast, Peter Drake is portrayed quite realistically, as he and a cast of “everyday heroes and heroines,"" including General Grant and Lianne Starling, deal with some extraordinary circumstances, tough times, action-packed scenes, and high drama. Sympathetic characters as well as despicable ones float in and out, yet ultimately, the main intrigue of the story concerns the complex relationships and dynamic interactions that occur between the good guys and the bad. Does each person deserve what he or she gets? Does each person move on with life – or simply fail? Read on to find out.About the AuthorFor the time being, Benedict J. Stuart resides in Europe with his girlfriend, taking care of two pets. They are still considered to be relatively young and intelligent. His dreams are mainly about better education, including lifelong learning, raising cultural awareness and improvement of overall human communication worldwide with the help of modern technology. Finally, he is a firm believer in broad general knowledge per se.",,,,,,,"['Science Fiction', 'Philosophy']"

","Dave is fourteen years old, living with his family in a cabin on Oregon's Mount Hood (or as Dave prefers to call it, like the Native Americans once did, Wy'east). He is entering high school, adulthood on the horizon not far off in distance, and contemplating a future away from his mother, father, and his precocious younger sister. And Dave is not the only one approaching adulthood and its freedoms on Wy'east that summer. Martin, a pine marten (a small animal of the deep woods, of the otter/mink family), is leaving his own mother and siblings and setting off on his own as well. As Martin and Dave's paths cross on forest trails and rocky mountaintops, they—and we—witness the full, unknowable breadth and vast sweep of life, and the awe-inspiring interconnectedness of the world and its many inhabitants, human and otherwise. Martin Marten is a coming-of-age tale like no other, told in Brian Doyle's joyous, rollicking style.",1250045207,9781250045201),Hardcover,,309 pages,"

","Our prisons, mental hospitals and streets are filled with tragic stories like Tuesday Storm's. Her childhood was riddled with torturous ""games"" and violent physical attacks. She was isolated from the rest of her family, locked in an attic with nothing but a bare bed and a bucket for a toilet, and fed just enough to keep her alive. The experts say it's next to impossible to find the soul's light in a dark past like Tuesday's. They say she'll never trust again after being betrayed by the people she loved most, or silence the voices inside her head telling her she's worthless and unloved. She's doomed to suffer a lifetime of depression and self-destructive behavior, and destined to be drawn to people who will again abuse her, or worse--she could become an abuser. That's what the experts say. And the thing about experts is--they're usually right. ""Call Me Cockroach"" is a chilling reminder of the unfortunate truth that no one survives the devastation of severe child abuse unscathed.For those of you who've read Byrne's compelling debut book, the Kindle eBook bestseller, ""Call Me Tuesday,"" this memoir unveils what became of the gutsy little girl who spent her early years at the mercy of a sadistic mother. To everyone else, it's an honest glimpse into the tormented mind and troubled heart of a damaged woman determined to overcome the debilitating aftermath of a horrific childhood.",,,Kindle Edition,,236 pages,"

","In I of the Vortex, Rodolfo Llinas, a founding father of modern brain science, presents an original view of the evolution and nature of mind. According to Llinas, the mindness state evolved to allow predictive interactions between mobile creatures and their environment. He illustrates the early evolution of mind through a primitive animal called the sea squirt. The mobile larval form has a brainlike ganglion that receives sensory information about the surrounding environment. As an adult, the sea squirt attaches itself to a stationary object then digests most of its own brain. This suggests that the nervous system evolved to allow active movement in animals. To move through the environment safely, a creature must anticipate the outcome of each movement on the basis of incoming sensory data. Thus the capacity to predict is most likely the ultimate brain function. One could even say that Self is the centralization of prediction.",0262122332,9780262122337),Hardcover,,302 pages,"

Lewis and Mariah are a thrice-blessed couple--handsome, rich, and seemingly happy. Yet, almost at once, Lucy begins to notice cracks in their beautiful facade. With mingled anger and compassion, Lucy scrutinizes the assumptions and verities of her employers' world and compares them with the vivid realities of her native place. Lucy has no illusions about her own past, but neither is she prepared to be deceived about where she presently is.  At the same time that Lucy is coming to terms with Lewis's and Mariah's lives, she is also unraveling the mysteries of her own sexuality. Gradually a new person unfolds: passionate, forthright, and disarmingly honest. In Lucy, Jamaica Kincaid has created a startling new character possessed with adamantine clearsightedness and ferocious integrity--a captivating heroine for our time.",2253153818,9782253153818),Mass Market Paperback,,163 pages,"

Like a hawk swooping toward its prey, Frank reached down and pulled her up by the hair, wrenching an arm behind her back. His fist pulled back again and a well-planned blow shot viciously into her stomach. The wind was knocked out of her. She couldn’t breathe. Still she struggled to escape. He pulled back his fist and hit her again, low in the abdomen. Laura doubled over as an agonizing pain ripped through her body, and she dropped to the floor again. A vicious kick landed into her belly, and she screamed in agony. She tried to roll away, to pull her knees up, protect her baby; but the pain consumed her and waves of blackness rolled over her, threatening to sweep her away.""________________________________________It’s time to return once again to Blacklick Valley and the unsuspecting inhabitants who live within its borders.________________________________________Frank Kinkaid is every woman’s dream-come-true—handsome, powerful, sophisticated, and very, very rich. A dream-come-true, that is, until he becomes her worst nightmare. For under this charismatic facade lies a man obsessed by the need to control, a man who regards women as objects to possess, to exploit, and to use to his own advantage, a man driven by heartless cruelty. For the magnetic Kinkaid, armed with shrewdness and charm, money and women seem easy to come by. But will one of these women, drawn in by fate, ultimately prove to be his demise?One storm-filled day in late April, the exquisitely stunning Laura O’Malley quite literally runs into Frank Kinkaid. Kinkaid has always loved beautiful women, comparing them to a fine thoroughbred or a rare piece of art. He immediately aspires to make Laura his own. She, on the other hand, is taken by both Kinkaid’s charm and good looks and is soon caught up by this handsome and charismatic stranger who charms and beguiles her. Little does she realize the consequences that lie ahead.Annie Ross is a young and naïve girl struggling to make it through her last year of college after a failed romance that has left her torn and broken. Coming from simple and provincial roots and a strict religious upbringing, she seems utterly unaware of her striking appeal and sexual allure to a man like Frank Kinkaid. Her loneliness and naiveté combine to make her an easy and vulnerable target for Kinkaid who sweeps her into a world she has only read about. Her life will change in a way she could never have imagined.Samantha Jessup grew up the hard way and learned early on that you had to fight for your place in the world. Ambitious and driven, Samantha has developed into a tough-minded, uncompromising businesswoman. Although strong-willed and highly successful, even she is no match for the cunning Frank Kinkaid and the destruction he brings into her life. But on a dark and turbulent summer night, in the wake of a violent storm brought in on a hot westerly wind, Frank Kinkaid will finally pay for his sins, will finally meet his destiny.

","In his blistering new novel, Cormac McCarthy returns to the Texas-Mexico border, setting of his famed Border Trilogy. The time is our own, when rustlers have given way to drug-runners and small towns have become free-fire zones. One day, a good old boy named Llewellyn Moss finds a pickup truck surrounded by a bodyguard of dead men. A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law–in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell–can contain.As Moss tries to evade his pursuers–in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives–McCarthy simultaneously strips down the American crime novel and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning’s headlines. No Country for Old Men is a triumph.From the Trade Paperback edition.",0375435042,9780375435041),Hardcover,Large Print,438 pages,"

","A Magical Tale About Forgiving Our Past and Believing in Our FutureThe enchanting, true story of The Valkyries begins in Rio de Janeiro when author Paulo Coelho gives his mysterious master J., the only manuscript for his book The Alchemist. Haunted by a devastating curse, Coelho confesses to J., ""I′ve seen my dreams fall apart just when I seemed about to achieve them."" In response, J. gives Coelho a daunting task: He must find and speak with his guardian angel. ""The curse can be broken,"" he replies, ""if you complete the task.""Rising to the challenge, Paulo and his wife, Cristina, drop everything, pack their bags, and take off on a forty day adventure into the starkly beautiful and sometimes dangerous Mojave Desert where they encounter more than they bargained for. A masterful blend of the exotic locales, dramatic adventure, and magical storytelling, for which Coelho′s fictional works are renowned, this true-life account is at once a modern-day adventure and a metaphysical odyssey.",0722533942,9780722533949),Paperback,,243 pages,"

Instead of basking in the glory of her article’s success, she’s on the run from a powerful man who wants her dead. To stay safe, she’s forced to trade one bad situation for another. Stuck in the Montana wilderness, she’s secluded from anything resembling civilization or the modern-day world.

He has no use for large crowds, noisy cities or dramatic women. So when a hotshot reporter rolls into town, dragging her big-time problems with her, he should have run for the hills. Instead, he volunteered to keep her safe. Bringing her into his world won’t be easy, but if he can convince her that Montana isn’t as terrifying as she believes, they might just be the perfect match.",,,ebook,,362 pages,"

Now I've learned the hard way that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end.""The world fondly remembers the many faces of Gilda Radner: the adamant but misinformed Emily Litella; the hyperkinetic Girl Scout Judy Miller; the irrepressibly nerdy Lisa Loopner; the gross-out queen of local network news, Rosanne Rosannadanna. A supremely funny performer, Gilda lost a long and painful struggle in May 1989 to ""the most unfunny thing in the world""--cancer. But the face she showed the world during this dark time was one of great courage and hope. ""It's Always Something is the story of her struggle told in Gilda's own remarkable words--a personal chronicle of strength and indomitable spirit and love undiminished by the cruel ravages of disease.This is Gilda, with whom we laughed on Saturday Night Live: warm, big-hearted, outrageous, and real.

Hoang mang hơn, Kate được giao nhiệm vụ trở về quá khứ để ngăn chặn nguồn cơn của sự can thiệp thô bạo. Thế nhưng, trước khi Kate có thể bắt đầu trọng trách này, cô phải đối mặt với một thảm kịch còn cấp bách hơn nhiều: bị xóa sổ hoàn toàn khỏi sự sống. Không còn bà ngoại và bố mẹ ở bên để yêu thương chỉ bảo, và đứng trước viễn cảnh chàng trai hết đỗi yêu thương cô, chỗ dựa vững chãi của cô trong chuỗi ngày kinh hoàng kia cũng sẽ không còn nhận ra mình, liệu Kate sẽ làm thế nào để cứu lấy cuộc sống của gia đình và chính bản thân?Căng thẳng, hấp dẫn và lãng mạn đến nhói lòng, Timebound tạo ra một cơn sốt ngay từ khi mới phát hành. Không chỉ lồng ghép một cách tài tình rất nhiều chi tiết về lịch sử tưởng như nhàm chán khô khan vào một cuộc phiêu lưu xuyên thời gian kỳ thú, nó còn đặc tả được một mối tình tuổi thanh xuân ngọt ngào nhưng đau đáu, cũng như thể hiện chân thực và gần gũi những tâm tư suy nghĩ của một cô thiếu nữ.

","Wilson's powerful new novel explores the life and times of one of the greatest British explorers, Captain Cook, and the golden age of Britain's period of expansion and exploration. Wilson's protagonist, witness to Cook's brilliance and wisdom, is George Forster, who travelled with Cook as botanist on board the HMS Resolution, on Cook's second expedition to the southern hemisphere, and penned a famous account of the journey. Resolution moves back and forth across time, to depict Forster's time with Cook, and his extraordinary later life, which ended with his death in Paris, during the French Revolution. Wilson once again demonstrates his great powers as a master craftsman of the historical and the human in this richly evoked novel, which brings to life the real and the extraordinary, brilliantly drawing together a remarkable cast of characters in order to look at human endeavour, ingenuity and valour.",1782398279,9781782398271),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","With the publication of her first novel, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Wonderfully attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and, through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty. Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her ability ""to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."" She writes ""with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming,"" said the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation, but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when it was first published.

",‫«از زندگی چه می‌خواهید؟ ممکن است بگویید همسری مهربان، کاری خوب و خانه ای زیبا. اما اینها صرفاً چیزهایی است که «در» زندگی می‌خواهید. اما پرسش این است که در میان چیزهایی که در جستجویشان هستید کدام‌یک برای شما از همه ارزشمندتر است؟ ... خیلی از ما اصلاً نمی‌دانیم هدف اصلی زندگیمان چیست. شاید بدانیم در هر دقیقه از زندگی یا هر دهه از عمرمان چه می‌خواهیم، اما هرگز درنگی نکرده‌ایم تا به هدف اصلی زندگیمان بیندیشیم. ... بدون فلسفه‌ای برای زندگی ممکن است بد زندگی کنیم. یعنی با وجود تمام سرگرمی‌های لذّت بخشی که داریم ممکن است در آخر کار، زندگی را با تلخکامی به پایان ببریم و وقتی در بستر مرگ افتاده‌ایم ببینیم تنها فرصتمان برای زندگی را از دست داده‌ایم.»‫ویلیام اروین، که مسئلهٔ اصلی‌اش یافتن راهی برای «خوب زندگی کردن» است، در این کتاب پس از پرداختن به ضرورت داشتن فلسفه‌ای برای زندگی به این پرسش می‌پردازد که «کجا باید به دنبال چنین فلسفه‌ای بگردیم؟» زیرا در دوران جدید فلسفه بیش از اندازه تخصصی شده است و در کمتر دانشگاهی فلسفهٔ زندگی درس می‌دهند. اما همیشه اینطور نبوده و بسیاری از فلاسفهٔ یونان و روم باستان نه تنها فلسفهٔ زندگی را موضوع ارزشمندی برای تأمل می‌دانستند بلکه اصلاً باورشان بر این بود که هدف اصلی فلسفه همین است.‫او به این نتیجه می‌رسد که کاوش در میان فلسفه‌های کهن راه نویدبخشی برای یافتن چنین فلسفه‌ای است. و از این میان فلسفهٔ زندگی رواقیون را یکی از بصیرت‌بخش‌ترین و قابل دفاع‌ترین‌ها فلسفه‌های زندگی می‌داند و می‌کوشد با بازبینی و دسته‌بندی این آموزه‌ها و با استفاده از تجربه‌های شخصی‌اش در مسیر رواقی زیستن نشان ‌دهد چطور بینش‌ها و توصیه‌های عملی رواقیون می‌تواند به ما آدم‌های دنیای امروز کمک کند بهتر زندگی کنیم.,,,Paperback,,388 pages,"

Well of course they are, but Jim McDoniel proves that don't have to be boring. Or sparkly.""— Veronica Belmont and Tom Merritt, Sword & LaserJim McDoniel’s debut novel, An Unattractive Vampire, is a darkly comic urban fantasy of ancient horrors in suburban cities. After three centuries trapped underground, thousand-year-old Yulric Bile—also known as the Curséd One, the Devil’s Apprentice, He Who Worships the Slumbering Horrors—awakens only to find that no one believes he is a vampire. Apparently he’s just too ugly—modern vampires, he soon discovers, are pretty, weak, and, most disturbing of all, good. Determined to reestablish his bloodstained reign, Yulric sets out to correct this disgusting turn of events or, at the very least, murder the person responsible. With the help of pert vampire-wannabe Amanda; Simon, the eight-year-old reincarnation of his greatest foe; and a cadre of ancient and ugly horrors, Yulric prepares to battle the glamorous undead. But who will win the right to determine, once and for all, what it truly means to be a vampire?",1941758630,9781941758632),ebook,,309 pages,"

Surrounded by men who are jockeying for power–Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony–young Octavius must work against the powerful Roman political machinations to claim his destiny as first Roman emperor.

","A modernist urban novel in the tradition of James Joyce, Adam Buenosayres is a tour-de-force that does for Buenos Aires what Carlos Fuentes did for Mexico City or José Lezama Lima did for Havana - chronicles a city teeming with life in all its clever and crass, rude and intelligent forms. Employing a range of literary styles and a variety of voices, Leopoldo Marechal parodies and celebrates Argentina's most brilliant literary and artistic generation, the martinfierristas of the 1920s, among them Jorge Luis Borges. First published in 1948 during the polarizing reign of Juan Perón, the novel was hailed by Julio Cortázar as an extraordinary event in twentieth-century Argentine literature. Set over the course of three break-neck days, Adam Buenosayres follows the protagonist through an apparent metaphysical awakening, a battle for his soul fought by angels and demons, and a descent through a place resembling a comic version of Dante's hell. Presenting both a breathtaking translation and thorough explanatory notes, Norman Cheadle captures the limitless language of Marechal's original and guides the reader along an unmatched journey through the culture of Buenos Aires. This first-ever English translation brings to light Marechal's masterwork with an introduction outlining the novel's importance in various contexts - Argentine, Latin American, and world literature - and with notes illuminating its literary, cultural, and historical references. A salient feature of the Argentine canon, Adam Buenosayres is both a path-breaking novel and a key text for understanding Argentina's cultural and political history.",0773543090,9780773543096),Paperback,,739 pages,"

Frech, witzig, provozierend und auf den Punkt gebracht widmet Ronja von Rönne sich darin ungemein scharfsinnig und wortgewaltig den Lebensentwürfen unserer Zeit. Sie schreibt über alles, was das Menschsein zur Unverschämtheit macht: » Positiv denken ist sehr in. Dabei ist das großer Unsinn. Wenn man z. B. sehr einsam ist, hilft es auch nicht, sich einzureden, man sei eigentlich nur die kleinste Polonaise der Welt. Denn die Wahrheit ist doch: Man fühlt sich sehr allein, und wenn Sie sich weiter einreden, lediglich ein ›sehr exklusives Clübchen‹ zu sein, bleibt es auch dabei.«Ein Buch im typischen Rönne-Sound, ein Muss für alle Fans des »neuen Sterns am Himmel des deutschen Popliteratentums«, wie das Deutschlandradio Kultur Ronja von Rönne genannt hat.",3596037034,9783596037032),Paperback,,204 pages,"

","By its evocation of a real or imaged heroic age, its contrasts of character and its variety of adventure, above all by its sheer narrative power, the Odyssey has won and preserved its place among the greatest tales in the world. It tells of Odysseus' adventurous wanderings as he returns from the long war at Troy to his home in the Greek island of Ithaca, where his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus have been waiting for him for twenty years. He meets a one-eyed giant, Polyphemus the Cyclops; he visits the underworld; he faces the terrible monsters Scylla and Charybdis; he extricates himself from the charms of Circe and Calypso. After these and numerous other legendary encounters he finally reaches home, where, disguised as a beggar, he begins to plan revenge on the suitors who have for years been besieging Penelope and feasting on his own meat and wine with insolent impunity.",0393964051,9780393964059),Paperback,Norton Critical Edition,414 pages,"

","Why does a good God allow innocent suffering? Why does a just God act unfairly? Why does a sovereign God let disease and evil run rampant? These are not questions asked from the onlooker's armchair, nor from the academic's desk, but from the anguish of the sickbed and the frustration of the wheelchair: The problem of pain is considered with the heart as well as the head. In Out of the Storm: Grappling With God in the Book of Job, Christopher Ash leads us through the biblical story of Job as we wrestle with these questions today. He explores honestly the lonely and cruel nature of suffering and whether or not God can be found in the midst of it. He exposes the shortcomings of Job's friends, who deny the possibility of innocent suffering and are unaware of the roles that evil, the fall and the cross have to play. With compassion and clarity he takes the reader through Job's long debate with God towards a humbling-and hopeful-resolution. Christopher Ash is Principal of the Cornhill Training Course in London, a teaching ministry of the Proclamation Trust . He is married to Carolyn and they have four children.",1844740560,9781844740567),Paperback,,112 pages,"

","From the author of Rust & Stardust comes this heartbreaking story, inspired by true events, of how far one mother must go to protect her daughter. Dover, Massachusetts, 1969. Ginny Richardson's heart was torn open when her baby girl, Lucy, born with Down Syndrome, was taken from her. Under pressure from his powerful family, her husband, Ab, sent Lucy away to Willowridge, a special school for the “feeble-minded."" Ab tried to convince Ginny it was for the best. That they should grieve for their daughter as though she were dead. That they should try to move on. But two years later, when Ginny's best friend, Marsha, shows her a series of articles exposing Willowridge as a hell-on-earth--its squalid hallways filled with neglected children--she knows she can't leave her daughter there. With Ginny's six-year-old son in tow, Ginny and Marsha drive to the school to see Lucy for themselves. What they find sets their course on a heart-racing journey across state lines—turning Ginny into a fugitive.For the first time, Ginny must test her own strength and face the world head-on as she fights Ab and his domineering father for the right to keep Lucy. Racing from Massachusetts to the beaches of Atlantic City, through the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia to a roadside mermaid show in Florida, Keeping Lucy is a searing portrait of just how far a mother’s love can take her.",1250164222,9781250164223),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","In this riveting box set, an award-winning author delves into the gritty, gruesome details of the most notorious serial killers to strike the United States, including the unidentified killers who may still be on the loose. This book is a compilation of four books: female serial killers, unsolved serial killings, notorious serial killers who were captured such as Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Son of Sam, and doctors who killed their patients. WOMEN WHO KILL When we hear about a Serial Killer, we never consider the sex, we would immediately assume a man...right? but that's not always the case! Females are for the most part, the loving and caring protectors of our species and the ones that are more susceptible to danger. However, they are in fact the most dangerous because they are the least suspected of the Serial Killers. Like their male counterparts, they show no remorse and have no mercy for their victims. Should we still call them the weaker sex? CASE CLOSED: SERIAL KILLERS CAPTURED When a Serial Killer is active in a community it is extremely scary for everyone. This book focuses on Serial Killers who have been captured and some of the most notorious and ruthless killers in history.Serial killers stay close to home and their victims are random. Dennis Rader found all his victims in Kansas not far from the Wichita home he shared with his wife and two kids. Rader, the president of his local church, knocked on his victim's doors and they simply let him in. John Wayne Gacy, met many of his 33 victims, all young men and boys, at charity events where he appeared dressed a clown. After luring them to his house and murdering them he stuffed them under his Cook County, Illinois home. Gary Leon Ridgway, the Green River Killer, was convicted of strangling 49 random women he met in Washington. He confessed to killing 71 but authorities believe the number of victims could be over 90. Jeffrey Dahmer of Milwaukee admitted to killing and cannibalizing 17 young men and boys before he was arrested.Case Closed is a compilation of criminal file dossiers on several of those Serial Killers that were captured. DOCTORS WHO KILLED This book captures the stories of five doctors who have killed their patients, including, Harold Shipman, Marcel Petiot, Michael Swango, H.H. Holmes, and John Bodkin Adams. It is amazing that these people chose a profession to help save lives, but preferred to kill.Is it not their job to curtail suffering and death? We sometimes put our lives in the hands of doctors, trusting that our best interests are the most important to them. Thankfully, there are only a handful of doctors who have been inclined to murder their patients, and they do not represent the millions of doctors who genuinely care and uphold their oath. UNSOLVED SERIAL KILLINGS If you enjoy reading true crime and especially reading about Unsolved Serial Killers, this is the book for you. It's hard to believe, that at any given time in the United States alone, there are thirty to fifty unidentified active serial killers at work constantly changing their targets and methods; however, some authorities think that number is even much higher.""Unsolved Serial Killings by RJ Parker is a fascinating glimpse into the mindsets of cold blooded serial killers. Complete with F.B.I stats, profile classifications and psychotic windows to peer into, this book is about the most horrific of criminals. There are some great examples of unsolved murders that leave the reader wondering, did the killer, stop killing, die, or go to prison on unrelated charges? A spellbinding page-turner from an author with investigator in his blood!""",1481959719,9781481959711),Paperback,Box Set,298 pages,"

","A two-ebook edition of Hilary Mantel' s bestselling novels: Wolf Hall, winner of the Man Booker Prize 2009, and Bring Up the Bodies, winner of the Man Booker Prize 2012.Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies, the first two instalments in Hilary Mantel' s Tudor trilogy, have gathered readers and praise in equal and enormous measure. They have been credited with elevating historical fiction to new heights and animating a period of history many thought too well known to be made fresh.Through the eyes and ears of Thomas Cromwell, the books' narrative prism, we are shown Tudor England, the court of King Henry VIII. Cromwell is a wholly original man: the son of a brutal blacksmith, a political genius, a briber, a charmer, a bully, a man with a delicate and deadly expertise in manipulating people and events.In Wolf Hall we witness Cromwell' s rise, beginning as clerk to Cardinal Wolsey, Henry' s chief advisor, charged with securing the divorce the pope refuses to grant. He is soon to become his successor. By 1535, when the action of Bring Up the Bodies begins, Cromwell is Chief Minister to Henry, his fortunes having risen with those of Anne Boleyn, Henry' s second wife. Anne' s days, though, are marked. Cromwell watches as the king falls in love with silent, plain Jane Seymour, sensing what Henry' s affection will mean for his queen, for England, and for himself.",1443422827,9781443422826),ebook,,965 pages,"

","After everything that the citizens of Beartown have gone through, they are struck yet another blow when they hear that their beloved local hockey team will soon be disbanded. What makes it worse is the obvious satisfaction that all the former Beartown players, who now play for a rival team in Hed, take in that fact. Amidst the mounting tension between the two rivals, a surprising newcomer is handpicked to be Beartown’s new hockey coach.Soon a new team starts to take shape around Amat, the fastest player you’ll ever see; Benji, the intense lone wolf; and Vidar, a born-to-be-bad troublemaker. But bringing this team together proves to be a challenge as old bonds are broken, new ones are formed, and the enmity with Hed grows more and more acute.As the big match approaches, the not-so-innocent pranks and incidents between the communities pile up and their mutual contempt grows deeper. By the time the last game is finally played, a resident of Beartown will be dead, and the people of both towns will be forced to wonder if, after all they’ve been through, the game they love can ever return to something simple and innocent.",1501160796,9781501160790),Hardcover,English edition,448 pages,"

The Bible is a story, not a lexicon of systematic theological definitions. With this in mind, The Through New Eyes Bible Commentary Series builds on the foundational Biblical-theology work of James B. Jordan and other like-minded scholars in bringing you a set of commentaries that will help you read, teach and preach through the Bible while picking up on the rich symphonic themes and the literary symbolism of the Scriptures.

","Celebrated novelist John Lanchester (author of The Debt to Pleasure) returns with an epic novel that captures the obsessions of our time. It’s 2008 and things are falling apart: Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers are going under, and the residents of Pepys Road, London—a banker and his shopaholic wife, an old woman dying of a brain tumor and her graffiti-artist grandson, Pakistani shop owners and a shadowy refugee who works as the meter maid, the young soccer star from Senegal and his minder—are receiving anonymous postcards reading “We Want What You Have.” Who is behind it? What do they want? Epic in scope yet intimate, capturing the ordinary dramas of very different lives, this is a novel of love and suspicion, of financial collapse and terrorist threat, of property values going up and fortunes going down, and of a city at a moment of extraordinary tension.",0393345092,9780393345094),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","For most of her life, Juliet Emerline has subsisted - isolated by deafness - making hats in the solitude of her home. Now, she's at risk to lose her sanctuary to Lord Nicolas Thornton, a mysterious and eccentric architect with designs on her humble estate. When she secretly witnesses him raging beside a grave, Juliet investigates, finding the name ""Hawk"" on the headstone and an unusual flower at the base. The moment Juliet touches the petals, a young English nobleman appears in ghostly form, singing a song only her deaf ears can hear. The ghost remembers nothing of his identity or death, other than the one name that haunts his afterlife: Thornton.To avenge her ghostly companion and save her estate, Juliet pushes aside her fear of society and travels to Lord Thornton's secluded holiday resort, posing as a hat maker in one of his boutiques. There, she finds herself questioning who to trust: the architect of flesh and bones who can relate to her through romantic gestures, heartfelt notes, and sensual touches ... or the specter who serenades her with beautiful songs and ardent words, touching her mind and soul like no other man ever can. As sinister truths behind Lord Thornton's interest in her estate and his tie to Hawk come to light, Juliet is lured into a web of secrets. But it's too late for escape, and the tragic love taking seed in her heart will alter her silent world forever.International and NYT bestselling author, A.G. Howard, brings her darkly magical and visual/visceral storytelling to Victorian England. The Architect of Song is the first installment in her lush and romantic Haunted Hearts Legacy series, a four book New Adult gothic saga following the generations of one family as - haunted by both literal and figurative ghosts - they search for self-acceptance, love, and happiness.Recommended for ages 16+",099768741X,9780997687415),Paperback,,431 pages,"

Zavala lo va a riprendere al canile, e il destino gli fa ritrovare, tra i dipendenti di quel luogo che sembra piuttosto un macello, Ambrosio, per molti anni autista di famiglia. Insieme vanno a bere una birra a «La Catedral», sordido locale di periferia, a dal loro dialogo viene fuori il romanzo di una città, e dei suoi deliri: storie di vinti e di illusi, di militari a caccia di potere, di politici, giornalisti, prostitute, delle loro sconfitte, ma anche di rari momenti di quiete. Destini personali che insieme restituiscono un'immagine globale della società di Lima, ma anche peruviana, e latinoamericana, negli anni cinquanta e sessanta.

","Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it all, and more—he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone, that is, but the devil inside. . . .",,,Kindle Edition,,388 pages,"

His young life is disrupted by two arrivals. The first is his aunt Julia, recently divorced and thirteen years older, with whom he begins a secret affair. The second is a manic radio scriptwriter named Pedro Camacho, whose racy, vituperative soap operas are holding the city's listeners in thrall. Pedro chooses young Marito to be his confidant as he slowly goes insane. Interweaving the story of Marito's life with the ever-more-fevered tales of Pedro Camacho, Vargas Llosa's novel is hilarious, mischievous, and masterful, a classic named one of the best books of the year by the New York Times Book Review.",0374106916,9780374106911),Paperback,,374 pages,"

Just when she despairs of making friends Greer receives a mysterious invitation with three words embossed upon on it: huntin' shootin' fishin'. When Greer learns that the invitation is to spend the half term weekend at the country manor of Henry de Warlencourt, the most popular and wealthy boy at S.T.A.G.S., she is as surprised as she is flattered.But when Greer joins the other chosen few at the ancient and sprawling Longcross Hall, she realises that Henry's parents are not at home; the only adults present are a cohort of eerily compliant servants.

","Beowulf is the greatest surviving work of literature in Old English, unparalleled in its epic grandeur and scope. It tells the story of the heroic Beowulf and of his battles, first with the monster Grendel, who has laid waste to the great hall of the Danish king Hrothgar, then with Grendel's avenging mother, and finally with a dragon that threatens to devastate his homeland. Through its blend of myth and history, Beowulf vividly evokes a twilight world in which men and supernatural forces live side by side. And it celebrates the endurance of the human spirit in a transient world.""Alexander's translation is marked by a conviction that it is possible to be both ambitious and faithful [and] ...communicates the poem with a care which goes beyond fidelity-to-meaning and reaches fidelity of implication. May it go on ... to another half-million copies."" - Tom Shippey, Bulletin of the International Association of University Professors of English",0140449310,9780140449310),Paperback,,137 pages,"

","Harry Bosch is California's newest private investigator. He doesn't advertise, he doesn't have an office, and he's picky about who he works for, but it doesn't matter. His chops from thirty years with the LAPD speak for themselves.Soon one of Southern California's biggest moguls comes calling. The reclusive billionaire is nearing the end of his life and is haunted by one regret. When he was young, he had a relationship with a Mexican girl, his great love. But soon after becoming pregnant, she disappeared. Did she have the baby? And if so, what happened to it?Desperate to know whether he has an heir, the dying magnate hires Bosch, the only person he can trust. With such a vast fortune at stake, Harry realizes that his mission could be risky not only for himself but for the one he's seeking. But as he begins to uncover the haunting story--and finds uncanny links to his own past--he knows he cannot rest until he finds the truth.At the same time, unable to leave cop work behind completely, he volunteers as an investigator for a tiny cash-strapped police department and finds himself tracking a serial rapist who is one of the most baffling and dangerous foes he has ever faced.",0316225940,9780316225946),Hardcover,,388 pages,"

Yes, Blake believes she’s a notorious spy named Carlotta De Leon, but for six weeks until her twenty-first birthday, when she’ll gain control of her own fortune, hiding out in the titillating company of a mysterious captor is awfully convenient—and maybe just a little romantic, too.Blake Ravenscroft’s mission is to bring “Carlotta” to justice, not to fall in love. His heart has been hardened by years of intrigue, but this little temptress proves oddly disarming and thoroughly kissable.

Wandering the streets of Tokyo and scribbling madly on the interior walls of his box, he describes the world outside as he sees or perhaps imagines it, a tenuous reality that seems to include a mysterious rifleman determined to shoot him, a seductive young nurse, and a doctor who wants to become a box man himself.

 could best be described as a lab manual with simple experiments to prove once and for all that reality is malleable, that consciousness trumps matter, and that you shape your life with your mind. Rather than take it on faith, you are invited to conduct nine 48-hour experiments to prove there really is a positive, loving, totally hip force in the universe. Yes, you read that right. It says prove.       The experiments, each of which can be conducted with absolutely no money and very little time expenditure, demonstrate that spiritual principles are as dependable as gravity, as consistent as Newton’s laws of motion. For years, you’ve been hoping and praying that spiritual principles are true. Now, you can know.       E-Squared proves the following: 1.       There is an invisible energy force or field of infinite possibilities. 2.       You impact the field and draw from it according to your beliefs and expectations. 3.       You, too, are a field of energy. 4.       Whatever you focus on expands.   5.       Your connection to the field provides accurate and unlimited guidance.6.       Your thoughts and consciousness impact matter. 7.       Your thoughts and consciousness provide the scaffolding for your physical body.8.       You are connected to everything and everyone else in the universe. 9.       The universe is limitless, abundant, and strangely accommodating.",1401938906,9781401938901),Paperback,,163 pages,"

Infatti, mentre il treno è bloccato dalla neve qualcuno tra i paseggeri pugnala a morte il signor Ratchett, un ricco americano. L’assassino deve per forza nascondersi fra i viaggiatori, ma nessuno di loro sembra avere avuto nessun motivo per commettere il crimine.

","India has endured a century of clouds heavy with acid rain, and rivers so thick with industrial effluent that they catch fire. Pollutants from toxic pesticides seep through the rich soils of rural Punjab, where a “Cancer Train” shuttles droves of farmers sick with chemical poisoning to oncology centers in foreign states. Sixty percent of the population lives without access to potable water. India’s ecosystem is on a precipice.In Elemental India, Meera Subramanian explores this environmental catastrophe through the five elements that make the building blocks of life—earth, water, fire, air, and ether. Her journey through this country home to 17.5% of the world’s population, and over two thousand ethnic groups, is hopeful. She reveals the modest triumphs of ordinary men and women who struggle to preserve India’s crumbling environment. Kanhaiya has spent the twenty-five years in semi-arid Rajasthan, helping villagers revive rainwater-harvesting practices and resuscitate their land from pervasive drought; Vibhu was the first to notice a baffling and dramatic decline in India’s vulture population in the 1990s and has since devoted his life to rescuing the species from extinction; Pinki Kumari campaigns against over-population and poverty by teaching young adolescents the fundamentals of sexual health in Bihar, a region in the north of India with one of the nation’s highest fertility rates and a notorious reputation for violence.In these stories, Subramanian looks for answers—for a country smothering under cloud of smog so vast that it is visible from outer space; for a country that is now the world’s clearest example of environmental catastrophe. Elemental India beautifully and memorably captures the conflict between humanity and its natural world.",1610395301,9781610395304),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","A man-made plague has swept the earth, but a small group survives, along with the green-eyed Crakers - a gentle species bio-engineered to replace humans. Toby, onetime member of the God's Gardeners and expert in mushrooms and bees, is still in love with street-smart Zeb, who has an interesting past. The Crakers' reluctant prophet, Snowman-the-Jimmy, is hallucinating; Amanda is in shock from a Painballer assault; and Ivory Bill yearns for the provocative Swift Fox, who is flirting with Zeb. Meanwhile, giant Pigoons and malevolent Painballers threaten to attack. Told with wit, dizzying imagination, and dark humour, Booker Prize-winning Margaret Atwood's unpredictable, chilling and hilarious MaddAddam takes us further into a challenging dystopian world - a moving and dramatic conclusion to the internationally celebrated trilogy that began with Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood.",1844087875,9781844087877),Paperback,,476 pages,"

","“I am sixteen years old. I am a human being.”Actually Sarah is several human beings. At once. And only one of them is sixteen. Her parents insist she’s a gifted artist with a bright future, but now she can’t draw a thing, not even her own hand. Meanwhile, there’s a ten-year-old Sarah with a filthy mouth, a bad sunburn, and a clear memory of the family vacation in Mexico that ruined everything. She’s a ray of sunshine compared to twenty-three-year-old Sarah, who has snazzy highlights and a bad attitude. And then there’s forty-year-old Sarah (makes good queso dip, doesn’t wear a bra, really wants sixteen-year-old Sarah to tell the truth about her art teacher). They’re all wandering Philadelphia—along with a homeless artist allegedly named Earl—and they’re all worried about Sarah’s future.But Sarah’s future isn’t the problem. The present is where she might be having an existential crisis. Or maybe all those other Sarahs are trying to wake her up before she’s lost forever in the tornado of violence and denial that is her parents’ marriage.“I am a human being. I am sixteen years old. That should be enough.”",1101994886,9781101994887),Hardcover,,295 pages,"

","Autumn of 1755 bestowed to the Leiningers’ world, not only its rich beauties, but also a rewarding harvest. On this particular day the whole valley seemed to rejoice in the fullness of the season—but suddenly Barbara and Regina’s peaceful frontier life is changed forever. General Braddock and his army had been defeated and soon the Pennsylvania settlers would suffer the bloody effects of the French and Indian War. On October 16, 1755, a band of Indians, led by Allegheny warriors, stormed through Buffalo Valley, burned the Leiningers’ log cabin, and captured the sisters. Few survived the Penn’s Creek Massacre and even fewer lived to tell the story. Regina makes a promise to her older sister just before they are unwillingly separated—each to endure different fates. Barbara is taken deep into the wilderness, but holds on to the hope that she will find her little sister. Though she is adopted into the Indian tribe, there is a longing deep inside that cannot be denied. She must escape—but the penalty if caught is certain death. No one expresses Barbara’s apprehensions better than her own words, written in 1759: “If one could not believe that there is a God, who helps and saves from death, one had better let running away alone...The extreme probability that the Indians would pursue and recapture us, was two to one compared with the dim hope that, perhaps, we would get through...even if we did escape the Indians, how would we ever succeed in passing through the wilderness, unacquainted with a single path or trail…""",1929241364,9781929241361),Hardcover,,203 pages,"

Agora, neste segundo tomo, Diana e Matthew viajam no tempo para a Londres de 1590, mas rapidamente se apercebem de que o passado pode não ser um lugar seguro. Matthew alia-se ao Escolha da Noite, um grupo radical de amigos e desregrados demónios, onde se encontram o dramaturgo Christopher Marlowe e o matemático Thomas Harriot e ao assumir as suas anteriores funções como espião de Isabel I, fica em contato com o submundo de uma Londres em ebulição e sedenta da caça às bruxas. Juntos, Matthew e Diana procuram nas velhas livrarias e nos laboratórios de alquimia o célebre Ashmole 782, sem o qual não poderão regressar ao tempo presente. Diana descobre que os seus poderes são muito maiores do que imaginava mas precisa de uma bruxa que lhe ensine a acordar, desenvolver e controlar as suas forças de tecedeira, o que não é fácil para a fêmea de um vampiro!",,,Paperback,,676 pages,"

"," You Can Grow Your Own Orchids, Yes You Can!   You're probably already thinking to yourself If I have to read a book to grow a flower in a pot, why should I bother?! Yeah, I know –but to be honest, there are a lot of excellent things that come with being able to master at least growing one successful pot of orchids. For one thing, they're gorgeous! Who wouldn't want to say, ""Yeah, I grew those…""?  Damn right you would! Being a badass indoor gardener is one thing, but tackling tropical plants like orchids is a feat unto itself. It's an artform. Think about it for a second. Most of us do not live in the climate conducive to these beauties just thriving on their own in the wild. Anyone who already actively grows and nurtures any species of orchid knows that you've got to climate control that environment like you wouldn't believe. It's not just about that, but you also must watch other factors too. It's an extremely rewarding yet very challenging experience.  In addition, there are so many different species of orchid out there that you can safely assume that each plant you grow is going to be unique to itself. You can get some that you know will definitely be the same color, size or general shape, but we all know that there are so many things unique to each plant. How many flower spikes you end up with after the first blooms dissipate, how many leaves you have, how tall it grows and so many other things are all going to be different.  The cool thing is that with the right know-how, you can nurture one potted orchid for years before you have to kiss it goodbye. In fact, you might keep them growing for almost a decade without even realizing it if you can take care them properly. It will also bolster your confidence when it comes to indoor gardening. You might have never planted anything outside, but you can throw these puppies in a pot and watch them go for forever if you follow a few key pointers and stay on top of their care. You just need to lovingly embrace the hobby and be patient with the process.  Heck, you could have a whole atrium or sunroom full of tropical flowers by the time you're finished fooling around with different kinds –and there are a lot of them! Just imagine the possibilities… In this book, you're going to learn all about how to start off on the right foot with one of the cantankerous ones: orchids. So get out your gloves, grab a bag of potting mix, start jotting down supplies on a notepad, and get growing!",,,Kindle Edition,,60 pages,"

Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.Then an act of sabotage releases the library’s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth’s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she’s been taught—about sorcerers, about the libraries she loves, even about herself.

Whisked from her home in Cairo, she was thrust into the dazzling royal court of Daevabad—and quickly discovered she would need all her grifter instincts to survive there.Now, with Daevabad entrenched in the dark aftermath of a devastating battle, Nahri must forge a new path for herself. But even as she embraces her heritage and the power it holds, she knows she’s been trapped in a gilded cage, watched by a king who rules from the throne that once belonged to her family—and one misstep will doom her tribe..Meanwhile, Ali has been exiled for daring to defy his father. Hunted by assassins, adrift on the unforgiving copper sands of his ancestral land, he is forced to rely on the frightening abilities the marid—the unpredictable water spirits—have gifted him. But in doing so, he threatens to unearth a terrible secret his family has long kept buried.And as a new century approaches and the djinn gather within Daevabad's towering brass walls for celebrations, a threat brews unseen in the desolate north. It’s a force that would bring a storm of fire straight to the city’s gates . . . and one that seeks the aid of a warrior trapped between worlds, torn between a violent duty he can never escape and a peace he fears he will never deserve.",0062678132,9780062678133),Hardcover,,621 pages,"

","""Mit achtzehn ging ich für ein Jahr nach Amerika. Noch heute erzähle ich oft, dass es ein Basketballstipendium war, aber das stimmt nicht. Meine Großeltern haben den Austausch bezahlt."" So beginnt der erste Roman von Joachim Meyerhoff, der seinen Ich-Erzähler aus der norddeutschen Provinz in die Weiten des amerikanischen Westens führt - und in ein Wechselbad der Gefühle. Entscheidend ist der selbstironische, empfindsame, pointiert-witzige Ton: Von der ersten Seite an folgt der Leser dem jugendlichen Helden, der sich aufmacht, einen der begehrten Plätze in einer amerikanischen Gastfamilie zu ergattern. Aber schon beim Auswahlgespräch in Hamburg werden ihm die Unterschiede zu den weltläufigen Großstadt-Jugendlichen schmerzlich bewusst. Konsequent gibt er sich im alles entscheidenden Fragebogen als genügsamer, naturbegeisterter und streng religiöser Kleinstädter aus - und findet sich bald darauf in Laramie, Wyoming wieder, mit Blick auf die Prärie, Pferde und die Rocky Mountains. Der drohende ""Kulturschock"" bleibt erst mal aus, der Stundenplan ist abwechslungsreich, die Basketballsaison steht bevor, doch dann reißt ein Anruf aus der Heimat ihn wieder zurück in seine Familie nach Norddeutschland - und in eine Trauer, der er nur mit einem erneuten Aufbruch nach Amerika begegnen kann.",3462042920,9783462042924),Hardcover,,319 pages,"

Depuis le mois de juillet de sa deuxième année d'université jusqu'au mois de janvier de l'année suivante, Tsukuru Tazaki vécut en pensant presque exclusivement à la mort.A Nagoya, Tsukuru Tazaki avait quatre amis. Le premier s'appelait Akamatsu, on le surnommait Mr Red ; le deuxième était Ômi, Mr Blue ; la troisième, Shirane, était Miss White et la dernière, Kurono, Miss Black. Tsukuru Tazaki, lui, était sans couleur. Tsukuru est parti à Tokyo ; les autres sont restés. Et un jour, ils l'ont appelé et lui ont dit qu'ils ne voulaient plus jamais le voir ni lui parler. Sans explications. Lui-même n'en a pas cherché. Pendant un temps, Tsukuru Tazaki a vécu comme Jonas dans le ventre de la baleine, comme un mort qui n'aurait pas encore compris qu'il est mort. Tsukuru est devenu architecte, ingénieur, designer ; il construit des gares. Aujourd'hui, Tsukuru Tazaki a rencontré Sara. Elle veut comprendre ce cercle d'amis, elle pense que Tsukuru ne sera jamais tranquille tant qu'il ne saura pas pourquoi il a été chassé.

New York Times and Publishers Weekly bestseller!

In New York Times bestselling author Maureen Johnson’s second novel in the Truly Devious series, there are more twists and turns than Stevie Bell can imagine. No answer is given freely, and someone will pay for the truth with their life. 
The Truly Devious case—an unsolved kidnapping and triple murder that rocked Ellingham Academy in 1936—has consumed Stevie for years. It’s the very reason she came to the academy. But then her classmate was murdered, and her parents quickly pull her out of school. For her safety, they say. She must move past this obsession with crime.Stevie’s willing to do anything to get back to Ellingham, be back with her friends, and solve the Truly Devious case. Even if it means making a deal with the despicable Senator Edward King. And when Stevie finally returns, she also returns to David: the guy she kissed, and the guy who lied about his identity—Edward King’s son.But larger issues are at play. Where did the murderer hide? What’s the meaning of the riddle Albert Ellingham left behind? And what, exactly, is at stake in the Truly Devious affair? The Ellingham case isn’t just a piece of history—it’s a live wire into the present. ",,,Kindle Edition,,376 pages,"

It is the year 2058, and technology now completely rules the world. But New York City Detective Eve Dallas knows that the irresistible impulses of the human heart are still ruled by just one thing: passion.  When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. Further complicating matters is Eve's growing attraction to Roarke, who is one of the wealthiest and most influential men on the planet, devilishly handsome... and the leading suspect in the investigation.",0399151575,9780399151576),Hardcover,,294 pages,"

Heartbreaking decisions
Evie was almost seduced by the life of comfort that Death offered her—until Jack was threatened by two of the most horrific Arcana, the Lovers. She will do anything to save him, even escape Death’s uncanny prison, full of beautiful objects, material comforts…and stolen glances from a former love.
Uncertain victory
Despite leaving a part of her heart behind with Death, Evie sets out into a perilous post-apocalyptic wasteland to meet up with her allies and launch an attack on the Lovers. Such formidable enemies require a battle plan, and the only way to kill them may mean Evie, Jack, and Death allying. Evie doesn’t know what will prove more impossible: surviving slavers, plague, Bagmen and other Arcana—or convincing Jack and Death to work together.
Two heroes returned
There’s a thin line between love and hate, and Evie just doesn’t know where she stands with either Jack or Death. Will this unlikely trio be able to defeat The Lovers without killing one another first...?",,,Paperback,,336 pages,"

Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing.The Time Traveler's Wife depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare's marriage and their passionate love for each other, as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals--steady jobs, good friends, children of their own.

","Baratunde Thurston shares his 30-plus years of expertise in being black, with helpful essays like “How to Be the Black Friend,” “How to Speak for All Black People,” “How To Celebrate Black History Month,” and more, in this satirical guide to race issues—written for black people and those who love them. Audacious, cunning, and razor-sharp, How to Be Black exposes the mass-media’s insidiously racist, monochromatic portrayal of black culture’s richness and variety. Fans of Stuff White People Like, This Week in Blackness, and Ending Racism in About an Hour will be captivated, uplifted, incensed, and inspired by this hilarious and powerful attack on America’s blacklisting of black culture: Baratunde Thurston’s How to Be Black.",0062003216,9780062003218),Hardcover,,254 pages,"

","Sixteen-year-old Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. Or at least make it out of her neighborhood one day. As the daughter of an underground rap legend who died before he hit big, Bri’s got big shoes to fill. But now that her mom has unexpectedly lost her job, food banks and shutoff notices are as much a part of Bri’s life as beats and rhymes. With bills piling up and homelessness staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it—she has to make it.On the Come Up is Angie Thomas’s homage to hip-hop, the art that sparked her passion for storytelling and continues to inspire her to this day. It is the story of fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you; of the struggle to become who you are and not who everyone expects you to be; and of the desperate realities of poor and working-class black families.",1406372161,9781406372168),Paperback,UK,435 pages,"

She has a public Facebook account and Tweets incessantly, telling Joe everything he needs to know: she is simply Beck to her friends, she went to Brown University, she lives on Bank Street, and she’ll be at a bar in Brooklyn tonight—the perfect place for a “chance” meeting.As Joe invisibly and obsessively takes control of Beck’s life, he orchestrates a series of events to ensure Beck finds herself in his waiting arms. Moving from stalker to boyfriend, Joe transforms himself into Beck’s perfect man, all while quietly removing the obstacles that stand in their way—even if it means murder.A terrifying exploration of how vulnerable we all are to stalking and manipulation, debut author Caroline Kepnes delivers a razor-sharp novel for our hyper-connected digital age.

","Casaubon, l'io narrante, è dapprima studente e poi giovane professionista dell'editoria a milano. Attraverso una serie di eventi, trova nel mito dei Cavalieri Templari, la sua vera raison d'être culturale e professionale. Da tale mito tuttavia si diramano una serie di filoni che corrispondono alla parte più occulta o a quella più reietta della cosiddetta civiltà occidentale. Attraverso la scoperta di questi filoni facciamo la conoscenza degli altri personaggi del romanzo, alcuni buoni, altri meno, ma tutti interessati a qualcosa. L'avidità di ottenere ciò che i vari protagonisti cercano manda in malora i buoni e i cattivi più deboli, per così dire. Casaubon, Belbo e Diotallevi, infatti, da un puro gioco traggono il Piano-Complotto la cui ""sgangheratezza"" (v. ciò che pensa del film Casablanca Umberto Eco) contribuisce a renderlo verosimile all'avido Agliè, in cerca di uno scopo verso cui indirizzare la società segreta paramassonica che capeggia. Milano, tratteggiata con evidente nostalgia, e la campagna attorno ad Alessandria, in cui la nostalgia è un po' più artefatta, sono i luoghi italiani in cui si snoda il vissuto del libro. Parigi è insieme inizio e finale del narrato, il cui epilogo è però consumato da Casaubon nella rassegnata attesa dei suoi nemici in una stanza del vecchio casolare di Belbo.",8845204081,9788845204081),Hardcover,Letteraria Bompiani ,509 pages,"

","A splendid presentation of Pope’s poems, excluding only his translations of Homer, this is the only one-volume edition that can lay claim to completeness and accuracy of text. It presents the corpus of Pope’s poetry as printed in the highly praised Twickenham Edition, except for the 1712 version of The Rape of the Lock and other early versions of phrases preserved in the critical apparatus of the six-volume work. Pope’s own notes to his poems are included, as well as a generous selection of the copious annotation in the Twickenham text. This reduced version of the unsurpassed standard edition of Pope will be of great value to all students and teachers of English literature. John Butt, Regius Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature at Edinburgh University, is general editor of the Twickenham Edition. ""The publishers are surely right in claiming that 'this should for long remain the standard one-volume edition of Pope's poems.' The Twichenham edition . . . has been a splendid achievement, and Professor Butt's distillation of the long labours of his fellow-editors is most commendable.""—Times Literary Supplement.",0300000308,9780300000306),Paperback,,880 pages,"

","Mapping a literary space uniquely his own, Evenson's CONTAGION AND OTHER STORIES pursues to a new level the crepescular and delirious exploration begun in his acclaimed and controversial ALTMANN'S TONGUE. In the O'Henry Award winning ""Two Brothers,"" a minister breaks his leg while his sons watch then refuses to call an ambulance, remaining convinced even unto death that God will arrive to lift him up and make him whole. The self-acclaimed language specialist of ""The Polygamy of Language"" indiscriminately blends linguistics with murder. ""Contagion"" is a skewed retelling of the early history of barbed wire, which interweaves metaphysics and the Western genre. ""Watson's Boy"" shows a boy endlessly wandering the human equivalent of a conditioned response box while the protagonist of ""By Halves"" finds himself trapped in a relationship that may not exist. Throughout, Evenson's immaculate prose draws us mercilessly up to confront troubled and troubling lives that, astoundingly, are no less human than our own.",1877655341,9781877655340),Paperback,,151 pages,"

","In Iceland, the age of the Vikings is also known as the Saga Age. A unique body of medieval literature, the Sagas rank with the world’s great literary treasures – as epic as Homer, as deep in tragedy as Sophocles, as engagingly human as Shakespeare. Set around the turn of the last millennium, these stories depict with an astonishingly modern realism the lives and deeds of the Norse men and women who first settled in Iceland and of their descendants, who ventured farther west to Greenland and, ultimately, North America. Sailing as far from the archetypal heroic adventure as the long ships did from home, the Sagas are written with psychological intensity, peopled by characters with depth, and explore perennial human issues like love, hate, fate and freedom.",0141000031,9780141000039),Paperback,,820 pages,"

","""Here is the first full translation into English of one of the 20th century's few undoubted classics of history."" —Washington Post Book WorldThe Autumn of the Middle Ages is Johan Huizinga's classic portrait of life, thought, and art in fourteenth- and fifteenth-century France and the Netherlands. Few who have read this book in English realize that The Waning of the Middle Ages, the only previous translation, is vastly different from the original Dutch, and incompatible will all other European-language translations. For Huizinga, the fourteenth- and fifteenth-century marked not the birth of a dramatically new era in history—the Renaissance—but the fullest, ripest phase of medieval life and thought. However, his work was criticized both at home and in Europe for being ""old-fashioned"" and ""too literary"" when The Waning of the Middle Ages was first published in 1919. In the 1924 translation, Fritz Hopman adapted, reduced and altered the Dutch edition—softening Huizinga's passionate arguments, dulling his nuances, and eliminating theoretical passages. He dropped many passages Huizinga had quoted in their original old French. Additionally, chapters were rearranged, all references were dropped, and mistranslations were introduced.This translation corrects such errors, recreating the second Dutch edition which represents Huizinga's thinking at its most important stage. Everything that was dropped or rearranged has been restored. Prose quotations appear in French, with translations preprinted at the bottom of the page, mistranslations have been corrected.""The advantages of the new translation are so many. . . . It is one of the greatest, as well as one of the most enthralling, historical classics of the twentieth century, and everyone will surely want to read it in the form that was obviously intended by the author."" —Francis Haskell, New York Review of Books""A once pathbreaking piece of historical interpretation. . . . This new translation will no doubt bring Huizinga and his pioneering work back into the discussion of historical interpretation."" —Rosamond McKitterick, New York Times Book Review",0226359921,9780226359922),Hardcover,,490 pages,"

","Imagine that as you leave your body at death, you hear the voice of a loved one whispering in your ear explanations of everything you see in the world beyond. Unlike other translations of the Bar do thos grol, the so-called 
Tibetan Book of the Dead
, Robert Thurman's takes literally the entire gamut of metaphysical assumptions. The Bar do thos grol, or as Thurman translates, The Great Book of Natural Liberation through Understanding in the Between, is but one of many mortuary texts of Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism and is commonly recited to or by a person facing imminent death. Thurman reproduces it for this purpose, explaining in some depth the Tibetan conception of post-mortem existence. Over as many as 12 days, the deceased person is given explanations of what he or she sees and experiences and is guided through innumerable visions of the realms beyond to reach eventual liberation, or, failing that, a safe rebirth. Like a backpacker's guide to a foreign land, Thurman's version is clear, detailed, and sympathetic to the inexperienced voyager, including background and supplementary information, even illustrations (sorry, no maps). Don't wait until the journey has begun, every page should be read and memorised well ahead of time. --Brian Bruya",0553370901,9780553370904),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","One murky night in 1816, on the shores of Lake Geneva, Lord Byron, famed English poet, challenged his friends to a contest--to write a ghost story. The assembled group included the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley; his lover (and future wife) Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; Mary's stepsister Claire Claremont; and Byron's physician, John William Polidori. The famous result was Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, a work that has retained its hold on the popular imagination for almost two centuries. Less well-known was the curious Polidori's contribution: the first vampire novel. And the evening begat a curse, too: Within a few years of Frankenstein's publication, nearly all of those involved met untimely deaths. Drawing upon letters, rarely tapped archives, and their own magisterial rereading of Frankenstein itself, Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler have crafted a rip-roaring tale of obsession and creation.",0316000787,9780316000789),Hardcover,,377 pages,"

A confession and manifesto from a senior leader in the emerging church movement. A Generous Orthodoxycalls for a radical, Christ-centered orthodoxy of faith and practice in a missional, generous spirit. Brian McLaren argues for a post-liberal, post-conservative, post-protestant convergence, which will stimulate lively interest and global conversation among thoughtful Christians from all traditions. In a sweeping exploration of belief, author Brian McLaren takes us across the landscape of faith, envisioning an orthodoxy that aims for Jesus, is driven by love, and is defined by missional intent. A Generous Orthodoxy rediscovers the mysterious and compelling ways that Jesus can be embraced across the entire Christian horizon. Rather than establishing what is and is not “orthodox,” McLaren walks through the many traditions of faith, bringing to the center a way of life that draws us closer to Christ and to each other. Whether you find yourself inside, outside, or somewhere on the fringe of Christianity, A Generous Orthodoxy draws you toward a way of living that looks beyond the “us/them” paradigm to the blessed and ancient paradox of “we.” Also available on abridged audio CD, read by the author.",0310258030,9780310258032),Paperback,Abridged,348 pages,"

","The Fellows family has joined numerous others striving to make a go of homesteading in the Oregon high desert. But the venture has been disastrous from the start. Mr. Fellows, who is not a farmer, resents any advice from his wife, who grew up on a farm. Ma is not only troubled about the farming, but 7-year-old Ellie s chronic illness has become a source of constant worry and expense. 12-year-old Chris, who cannot seem to please his father no matter what he does, eases his own misery by stealing time away from work to watch a neighbor s scarcely broken black pony, only to get into more trouble. When it seems circumstances could not get worse for the struggling family, Fellows gets drunk and dies. Not willing to give up, Ma stubbornly and creatively seeks a way for the family to stay in Oregon. Frank Chase, an unintentional element in the death of Chris s father, is added to the mix and challenged by Ma to keep his word to help the family. The resultant dramatic and sometimes humorous contest of wills comes to a satisfying culmination when, after Frank s purchase of the wild black pony for Chris, Ma is reluctantly forced to once again use her backbone of steel for the good of all. Walt Morey s careful research and vivid storytelling talent warmly bring to life the struggles and triumphs of homesteading in the Oregon high desert country in the early 1900 s.

Piggy's Lonely Hearts Club Comic, the first Pearls Before Swine treasury-supersized for your enjoyment.But this is no ordinary cartoon treasury. Like the influential Beatles album that inspired the book's title, Sgt. Piggy is full of surprises. In addition to collecting all of the Pearls cartoons that appeared in BLTs Taste So Darn Good and This Little Piggy Stayed Home, cartoonist Stephan Pastis takes readers on a VIP backstage tour of one of the most successful comic strips in newspapers today. In Sgt. Piggy, Pastis explains the genesis of Pearls (hint: it didn't begin at an artist's easel), why he was initially reluctant to show it to newspaper syndicates (and the surprising reason he changed his mind), the unexpected responses from readers to his work, and which Pearls strips worked and which ones didn't (and how he would have corrected the ones that didn't). The result is a rare and revealing glimpse into the world of Rat, Pig, Goat and Zebra. Full of humor and insight, sardonic asides and unexpected truths, Sgt.

","Tonypandy in 1910 is a town of poverty, hardship, and strife, garrisoned by troops brought in to control the striking miners whose anger all too frequently erupts into bouts of violence and rioting. Megan Williams is 18 and in love with the boy next door, Victor Evans.

","In Maggie Barlow's world, reality is overrated. So what if her singing career has hit a sour note or she's no longer the ingénue that she used to be? So what if she drinks and smokes a bit too much or likes to chat with a fairy godperson who appears to her from time to time? She's the queen of denial and an actress to boot—she can just take on the role of someone she likes better than her sorry self. Regrettably, that role is currently Dorothy in the Little Britches Theater Company's production of The Wizard of Oz.Dorothy on the Rocks is the story of a funny, lovable, totally self-destructive woman who, after a night of one-drink-too-many, wakes up with a strange man in her bed: confident, handsome, sexy, twenty-eight-year-old Jack. What happens next is what makes Barbara Suter's coming-of-middle-age tale so much fun. For when the make-believe is finally stripped away, our hurt, lonely, and very afraid heroine finally takes center stage and finds herself starring in a totally improbable love story. It just might be the role of a lifetime.",1565124715,9781565124714),Paperback,,325 pages,"

","In 1897, an aspiring politician is mysteriously murdered in the rural area of Alabama known as Mitcham Beat. His outraged friends -- mostly poor cotton farmers -- form a secret society, Hell-at-the-Breech, to punish the townspeople they believe responsible. The hooded members wage a bloody year-long campaign of terror that culminates in a massacre where the innocent suffer alongside the guilty. Caught in the maelstrom of the Mitcham war are four people: the aging sheriff sympathetic to both sides; the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of Hell-at-the-Breech; a ruthless detective who wages his own war against the gang; and a young store clerk who harbors a terrible secret. Based on incidents that occurred a few miles from the author's childhood home, Hell at the Breech chronicles the events of dark days that led the people involved to discover their capacity for good, evil, or for both.",0002261596,9780002261593),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Poetry. Native American Studies. ""Whether slyly identifying irony as a white man's invention, or deftly moving from prose-like multilayered narratives to formal poetry and song structures, this fifth collection from poet, novelist, and screenwriter Alexie demonstrates many of his skills. Most prominent perhaps is his ability to handle multiple perspectives and complex psychological subject matter with a humor that feeds readability: 'Successful non-Indian writers are viewed as well-informed about Indian life. Successful mixed-blood writers are viewed as wonderful translators of Indian life. Successful Indian writers are viewed as traditional storytellers of Indian life.' Poems such as the title one, a haunting chant for lost family, and 'The Theology of Cockroaches, ' do some vivid scene setting: '...never/woke to a wall filled with cockroaches/spelling out my name, never/stepped into a dark room and heard/the cockroaches baying at the moon.' At times Alexie allows his language, within the lineated poems almost exclusively, to slacken into cliche. The opening, multipart prose piece 'The Unauthorized Biography of Me' is arguably the strongest in the book, juxtaposing roughly chronological anecdotes with 'An Incomplete List of People I Wish Were Indian' and the formula 'Poetry = anger x imagination.' Other poems tell of 'Migration, 1902' and 'Sex in Motel Rooms'; describe 'How It Happens' and 'Second Grief'; and develop 'The Anatomy of Mushrooms.' Alexie's latest is as powerful and challenging as his previous excellent books, and should only add readers to his ever-widening audience"" Publishers Weekly.""",1882413768,9781882413768),Paperback,,91 pages,"

Born in 1935, Inger Christensen is Denmark's best known poet. Her award-winning alphabet is based structurally on Fibonacci's sequence (a mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two previous numbers), in combination with the alphabet. The gorgeous poetry herein reflects a complex philosophical background, yet has a visionary quality, discovering the metaphysical in the simple stuff of everyday life. In alphabet, Christensen creates a framework of psalm-like forms that unfold like expanding universes, while crystallizing both the beauty and the potential for destruction that permeate our times.",081121477X,9780811214773),Paperback,,79 pages,"

","Permaculture is a verbal marriage of ""permanent"" and ""agriculture."" Australian Bill Mollison pioneered its development. Key features include:- use of compatible perennials;- non-invasive planting techniques;- emphasis on biodiversity;- specifically adaptable to local climate, landscape, and soil conditions;- highly productive output of edibles.Now, picture your backyard as one incredibly lush garden, filled with edible flowers, bursting with fruit and berries, and carpeted with scented herbs and tangy salad greens. The visual impact is of Monet's palette, a wash of color, texture, and hue. But this is no still life. The flowers nurture endangered pollinators. Bright-featured songbirds feed on abundant berries and gather twigs for their nests.The plants themselves are grouped in natural communities, where each species plays a role in building soil, deterring pests, storing nutrients, and luring beneficial insects. And finally, you—good ol' homo sapiens—are an integral part of the scene. Your garden tools are resting against a nearby tree, and have a slight patina of rust, because this garden requires so little maintenance. You recline into a hammock to admire your work. You have created a garden paradise.This is no dream, but rather an ecological garden, which takes the principles of permaculture and applies them on a home-scale. There is nothing technical, intrusive, secretive, or expensive about this form of gardening. All that is required is some botanical knowledge (which is in this book) and a mindset that defines a backyard paradise as something other than a carpet of grass fed by MiracleGro.",1890132527,9781890132521),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","La novela El Señor Presidente se llamó primero Los mendigos políticos. Era un cuento que Miguel Ángel Asturias ya tenía escrito cuando en 1923 partió de Guatemala para instalarse en Europa. Asturias había sido testigo desde muy joven de la situación de desigualdad entre las clases, de la explotación injusta del campesinado y de la sensación palpable del miedo a los horrores de las dictaduras, pero no comprendía aún las razones por las que tales circunstancias existían y cuál era la forma de conjurar la situación. Fue en Europa donde tomó conciencia de los valores escondidos en la cultura tradicional de los ""hombres de maíz"". Y fueron muchos los pasos que tuvo que dar en su larga preparación de ilustración universal, de confrontación de ideas y estilos, para que siguiendo el consejo que le diera Paul Valéry llegara a describir a su pueblo para ser universal. Así se produjo la larga gestación de El Señor Presidente, que por encima de su condición de novela-denuncia trasciende los ecos surgidos en la memoria colectiva a partir de la resonancia natural de las palabras, las fantasías oníricas asimiladas de manera gradual por la realidad de la vida.",8437615178,9788437615172),Paperback,6th edition,428 pages,"

The heroine, Miriam, unwillingly gifted with the power to heal, falls victim to a savage Inquisition that condemns her ability as witchcraft, and to a ruthless nobleman who rapes her after she saves his life. Baudino understands the psychology of the persecuted, astutely motivating the self-immolating rage that consumes Miriam and leads her to undergo a complete, magical physical metamorphosis (she becomes tall, strong and beautiful) so that she can be a scourge for her enemies. Though the plot has its share of exciting sword fights, bold rescues and similar stock-in-trade, Baudino focuses on Miriam's interior journey--her spiritual (which accompanies the corporeal) transformation through contact with the uncorrupted Elves, with the pagan priestesses known as witches and with simple Christians. Her tale acquires an elegiac power, mourning the loss of innocent sources of wisdom even as it vividly imagines them.""",0451453166,9780451453167),Paperback,,384 pages,"

At the tail end of a busy Mardi Gras, Milford Goodman walks into their kitchen—he’s spent the last ten years in Angola Prison for murdering his boss, a wealthy New Orleans restaurateur, but has recently been exonerated on new evidence and released. Rickey remembers him as an ingenious chef and hires him on the spot. When a pill-pushing doctor and a Carnival scion talk Rickey into consulting at the restaurant they’re opening in one of the city’s “floating casinos,” Rickey recommends Milford for the head chef position and stays on to supervise. But soon Rickey finds himself medicating a kitchen injury with the doctor’s wares, and G-man grows tired of holding down the fort at Liquor alone. As the new restaurant moves toward its opening, Rickey learns that Milford’s past is inextricably linked with one of the project’s backers, a man whose intentions begin to seem more and more sinister.Full of the flavor of one of America’s greatest cities, Soul Kitchen is a sharp commentary on race relations in pre-Katrina New Orleans and a fast ride through the dark side of haute cuisine.",0307237656,9780307237651),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Award-winning US writer Nell Freudenberger's stunning debut collection A collection of five stories, Lucky Girls is set in India and southern Asia. The characters -- rootless, often en route to someplace else -- find themselves variously attracted to or repelled by unfamiliar landscapes where every object seems strange and every emotion is heightened. Living according to alien rules, these characters are also vulnerable in unexpected ways: in the title story, a young woman who has been involved in an affair with an Indian man feels bound to both her memories and her adopted country after his death; the protagonist of 'Outside the Eastern Gate' returns to her childhood home in Delhi to find a house still inhabited by the impulsive, desperate spirit of her mother.",0330493418,9780330493413),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","From Neal Gabler, the definitive portrait of one of the most important figures in twentieth-century American entertainment and cultural history.Seven years in the making and meticulously researched - Gabler is the first writer to be given complete access to the Disney archives - this is the full story of a man whose work left an ineradicable brand on our culture but whose life has largely been enshrouded in myth.Gabler shows us the young Walt Disney breaking free of a heartland childhood of discipline and deprivation and making his way to Hollywood. We see the visionary, whose desire for escape honed an innate sense of what people wanted to see on the screen and, when combined with iron determination and obsessive perfectionism, led him to the reinvention of animation. It was Disney, first with Mickey Mouse and then with his feature films - most notably Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo, and Bambi - who transformed animation from a novelty based on movement to an art form that presented an illusion of life.We see him reimagine the amusement park with Disneyland, prompting critics to coin the word Disneyfication to describe the process by which reality can be modified to fit one's personal desires. At the same time, he provided a new way to connect with American history through his live-action films and purveyed a view of the country so coherent that even today one can speak meaningfully of ""Walt Disney's America."" We see how the True-Life Adventure nature documentaries he produced helped create the environmental movement by sensitizing the general public to issues of conservation. And we see how he reshaped the entertainment industry by building a synergistic empire that combined film, television, theme parks, music, book publishing, and merchandise in a way that was unprecedented and was later widely imitated.Gabler also reveals a wounded, lonely, and often disappointed man, who, despite worldwide success, was plagued with financial problems much of his life, suffered a nervous breakdown, and at times retreated into pitiable seclusion in his workshop making model trains. Gabler explores accusations that Disney was a red-baiter, an anti-Semite, an embittered alcoholic. But whatever the characterizations of Disney's personal life, he appealed to the nation by demonstrating the power of wish fulfillment and the triumph of the American imagination. Walt Disney showed how one could impose one's will on the world.This is a masterly biography, a revelation of both the work and the man - of both the remarkable accomplishment and the hidden life.",067943822X,9780679438229),Hardcover,,851 pages,"

The town is as poor as it was when Leo left, yet some things have changed. Of Leo's childhood companions, only little Guido, whom everyone calls ""Topo,"" embraces him. His best friend is long dead. The woman he once adored refuses to talk to him. And, worst of all, the kindly old town priest seems to have lost his faith.

","Even in death, Skilgannon the Damned's name lives on. Now, as an ancient evil threatens to flood the Drenai heartlands in a tide of blood, he returns...A thousand years after they fell in battle, two heroes - Druss and Skilgannon - are revered throughout the war-torn lands of the Dernai, where men and women live in abject fear of the dark sorceress known as the Eternal...But what if the soul of one such hero could be called back from the void, his bones housed again in flesh? An ancient prophecy foretold that Skilgannon would return in his people's darkest hour. To most, this was a foolish hope. But not so to Landis Kan. Having found Skilgannon's ancient tomb, he gathers up the bones and peforms the mystic ritual.But the reborn hero is an enigma: a young man whose warrior skills are blunted and whose memories are fragmented. This Skilgannon is a man out of time, Marooned in a world as strange to him as a dream, remote from all he knew and loved. Or nearly all. Before bringing back Skilgannon, Landis Kan had experimented upon other bone fragments found in the hero's tomb. That ritual resulted in a surly giant who possessed astounding strength but no memories. To Kan, he is a dangerous failure. To Skilgannon, this giant represents their last hope.As ageless evil threatens to drown the Drenai lands in blood, two legendary heroes will once again lead the way to freedom.",0552146781,9780552146784),Paperback,,640 pages,"

","""Gentleman Jim"" Scott was a brilliant magnetic general. Like a lot of people, he believed the President was ruining the country. Unlike anyone else, he had the power to do something about it, something unprecedented and terrifying. Colonel ""Jiggs"" Casey was the marine who accidentally stumbled onto the plot. At first he refused to believe it; then he risked his life and career to inform the President. Jordan Lyman was President of the United States. By the time he was finally able to convince himself of the appalling truth, he had only seven days left to stop a brilliant, seemingly irresistible military plot to seize control of the government of the United States.Seven Days in May is a political thriller novel written by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II and published in 1962. It was made into a motion picture in 1964, with a screenplay by Rod Serling, directed by John Frankenheimer, and starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.The story is said to have been influenced by the right-wing anti-Communist political activities of General Edwin A. Walker after he resigned from the military. The author, Knebel, got the idea for the book after interviewing then-Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay.",0060124350,9780060124359),Hardcover,1st,341 pages,"

","Charlie Parker is a lost soul. Deprived of his private investigator's license and under scrutiny by the police, Parker takes a job in a Portland bar. But he uses his enforced retirement to begin a different kind of investigation: an examination of his own past and an inquiry into the death of his father, who took his own life after apparently shooting dead two unarmed teenagers. It's a search that will eventually lead Parker to question all that he believed about his beloved parents, and about himself.But there are other forces at work: a troubled young woman who is running from an unseen threat, one that has already taken the life of her boyfriend; and a journalist-turned-writer named Mickey Wallace, who is conducting an investigation of his own. And haunting the shadows, as they have done throughout Parker's life, are two figures: a man and a woman who seem driven to bring an end to Charlie Parker's existence.Haunting, lyrical, and impossible to put down, ""The Lovers"" is John Connolly at his best.Compact Disk Includes a Bonus MP3 CD of John Connolly's ""Every Dead Thing""!",1416569545,9781416569541),Hardcover,,341 pages,"

","Thousands of books have already been written on Atlantis since its reality was first disclosed by the great philosopher Plato, some two and a half millennia ago. Hence, one may well wonder whether a new book on the subject is really needed. Can anything new actually be said about Atlantis? The answer is a most categorical yes. After all, the riddle of Atlantis has never been satisfactorily solved so far. The present book is an attempt by a reputed scientist, to scientifically compare and refute – perhaps for the first time ever – the various existing theories on Atlantis’ location and reality. The author also expounds his own theory which definitively locates Atlantis in Indonesia. In his research, Prof. Santos marries the most recent results and techniques of Modern Science to the sacred and folk lore of all the peoples of the world, knitting humanity together in a solution to the riddle of Atlantis that neatly ties together the vast scientific and traditional evidence which was always there but never before seen by other researchers. The reader, whether a scientist with an open mind or a lay person, is led to conclude that Plato could well have been telling the truth, after all, since the information provided by the great philosopher is so uncannily confirmed by the recent scientific finds of all sorts.",0976955008,9780976955009),,,355 pages,"

Once again Ladinsky reveals his talent for creating profound and playful renditions of classic poems for a modern audience. Rumi's joyous, ecstatic love poems; St. Francis's loving observations of nature through the eyes of Catholicism; Kabir's wild, freeing humor that synthesizes Hindu, Muslim, and Christian beliefs; St. Teresa's sensual verse; and the mystical, healing words of Sufi poet Hafiz—these along with inspiring works by Rabia, Meister Eckhart, St. Thomas Aquinas, Mira, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, and Tukaram are all “love poems by God,” from writers considered to be ""conduits of the divine.""

","La suite de «La reine Margot». Située entre le 9 février 1578 et le 19 août 1579, l'action s'ouvre sur le mariage de Saint-Luc, ex-amant de la reine Margot et favori d'Henri III, rappelé de Pologne pour succéder à Charles IX. Chicot, personnage central de la trilogie, déjoue avec maestria les conspirations contre le roi qui se succèdent. Sur ce fond d'intrigues, se déroule l'histoire des amours de Diane de Méridor, dame de Montsoreau, et du beau Bussy d'Amboise...  Extrait:  Le dimanche gras de l’année 1578, après la fête du populaire, et tandis que s’éteignaient dans les rues les rumeurs de la joyeuse journée, commençait une fête splendide dans le magnifique hôtel que venait de se faire bâtir, de l’autre côté de l’eau et presque en face du Louvre, cette illustre famille de Montmorency qui, alliée à la royauté de France, marchait l’égale des familles princières. Cette fête particulière, qui succédait à la fête publique, avait pour but de célébrer les noces de François d’Épinay de Saint-Luc, grand ami du roi Henri III et l’un de ses favoris les plus intimes, avec Jeanne de Cossé-Brissac, fille du maréchal de France de ce nom.  Le repas avait eu lieu au Louvre, et le roi, qui avait consenti à grand’peine au mariage, avait paru au festin avec un visage sévère qui n’avait rien d’approprié à la circonstance. Son costume, en outre, paraissait en harmonie avec son visage : c’était ce costume marron foncé sous lequel Clouet nous l’a montré assistant aux noces de Joyeuse, et cette espèce de spectre royal, sérieux jusqu’à la majesté, avait glacé d’effroi tout le monde, et surtout la jeune mariée, qu’il regardait fort de travers toutes les fois qu’il la regardait.  Cependant cette attitude sombre du roi, au milieu de la joie de cette fête, ne semblait étrange à personne ; car la cause en était un de ces secrets de cœur que tout le monde côtoie avec précaution, comme ces écueils à fleur d’eau auxquels on est sûr de se briser en les touchant.  À peine le repas terminé, le roi s’était levé brusquement, et force avait été aussitôt à tout le monde, même à ceux qui avouaient tout bas leur désir de rester à table, de suivre l’exemple du roi. Alors Saint-Luc avait jeté un long regard sur sa femme, comme pour puiser du courage dans ses yeux, et s’approchant du roi :  — Sire, lui dit-il, Votre Majesté me fera-t-elle l’honneur d’accepter les violons que je veux lui donner à l’hôtel de Montmorency, ce soir ?  Henri III s’était alors retourné avec un mélange de colère et de chagrin, et, comme Saint-Luc, courbé devant lui, l’implorait avec une voix des plus douces et une mine des plus engageantes :  — Oui, monsieur, avait-il répondu, nous irons, quoique vous ne méritiez certainement pas cette preuve d’amitié de notre part.  Alors mademoiselle de Brissac, devenue madame de Saint-Luc, avait remercié humblement le roi. Mais Henri avait tourné le dos sans répondre à ses remerciements.",160096902X,9781600969027),Paperback,,596 pages,"

","The subject of this book is how human beings construe their experience of the world. The construction of experience is usually thought of as knowledge, represented in the form of conceptual taxonomies, schemata, scripts and the like. The authors offer an interpretation that is complementary to this, treating experience not as knowing but as meaning; and hence as something that is construed in language. In other words, the concern is with the construal of human experience as a semantic system; and since language plays the central role not only in storing and exchanging experience but also in construing it, language is taken as the interpretative base.The focus of the book is both theoretical and descriptive. The authors consider it important that theory and description should develop in parallel, with constant interchange between the two. The major descriptive component is an account of the most general features of the ideational semantics of English, which is then exemplified in two familiar text types (recipes and weather forecasts). There is also a brief reference to the semantics of Chinese. Theoretical issues are raised throughout as they become relevant to the discussion, with the theoretical base being drawn from systemic functional linguistics. Both the theoretical and descriptive proposals offered in the book are compared and contrasted with approaches deriving from AI, cognitive science and cognitive linguistics.",0826488927,9780826488923),Paperback,,672 pages,"

","A cosmic war is a religious war. It is a battle not between armies or nations, but between the forces of good and evil, a war in which God is believed to be directly engaged on behalf of one side against the other. The hijackers who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, thought they were fighting a cosmic war. According to award-winning writer and scholar of religions Reza Aslan, by infusing the United States War on Terror with the same kind of religiously polarizing rhetoric and Manichean worldview, is also fighting a cosmic war-a war that can't be won. How to Win a Cosmic War""""is both an in-depth study of the ideology fueling al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, and like-minded militants throughout the Muslim world, and an exploration of religious violence in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Surveying the global scene from Israel to Iraq and from New York to the Netherlands, Aslan argues that religion is a stronger force today than it has been in a century. At a time when religion and politics are increasingly sharing the same vocabulary and functioning in the same sphere, Aslan writes that we must strip the conflicts of our world-in particular, the War on Terror-of their religious connotations and address the earthly grievances that always lie behind the cosmic impulse. How do you win a cosmic war? By refusing to fight in one.",1400066727,9781400066728),Hardcover,,228 pages,"

      Our Daily Meds: How the Pharmaceutical Companies Transformed Themselves Into Slick Marketing Machines and Hooked the Nation on Prescription Drugs

","In the last thirty years, the big pharmaceutical companies have transformed themselves into marketing machines selling dangerous medicines as if they were Coca-Cola or Cadillacs. They pitch drugs with video games and soft cuddly toys for children; promote them in churches and subways, at NASCAR races and state fairs. They've become experts at promoting fear of disease, just so they can sell us hope. No question: drugs can save lives. But the relentless marketing that has enriched corporate executives and sent stock prices soaring has come with a dark side. Prescription pills taken as directed by physicians are estimated to kill one American every five minutes. And that figure doesn't reflect the damage done as the overmedicated take to the roads. ""Our Daily Meds ""connects the dots for the first time to show how corporate salesmanship has triumphed over science inside the biggest pharmaceutical companies and, in turn, how this promotion driven industry has taken over the practice of medicine and is changing American life. It is an ageless story of the battle between good and evil, with potentially life-changing consequences for everyone, not just the 65 percent of Americans who unscrew a prescription cap every day. An industry with the promise to help so many is now leaving a legacy of needless harm. Melody Petersen covered the pharmaceutical beat for ""The New York Times ""for four years. In 1997, her investigative reporting won a Gerald Loeb Award, one of the highest honors in business journalism. She lives with her husband in Los Angeles.

","Burke is one of the most cold-blooded yet strangely honorable heroes in the history of crime fiction, an outlaw who makes his living by preying on the most vicious of New York City's bottom-feeders, those who thrive on the suffering of children. In Andrew Vachss's tautly engrossing novel Burke is given a purse full of dirty money to find the infamous Ghost Van that is cutting a lethal swath among the teenage prostitutes in the hood. He also gets help in the form of a stripper named Belle, whose moves on the runway are outclassed only by what she can do in a getaway car. But not even Burke is prepared for the evil that is behind the Ghost Van or for the sheer menace of its guardian, a cadaverous karate expert who enjoys killing so much that he has named himself after death.

","Never before available in English, The Halfway House is a trip to the darkest corners of the human condition. Humiliations, filth, stench, and physical abuse comprise the asphyxiating atmosphere of a halfway house for indigents in Miami where, in a shaken mental state, the writer William Figueras lives after his exile from Cuba. He claims to have gone crazy after the Cuban government judged his first novel “morose, pornographic, and also irreverent, because it dealt harshly with the Communist Party,” and prohibited its publication. By the time he arrives in Miami twenty years later, he is a “toothless, skinny, frightened guy who had to be admitted to a psychiatric ward that very day” instead of the ready-for-success exile his relatives expected to welcome and receive among them. Placed in a halfway house, with its trapped bestial inhabitants and abusive overseers, he enters a hell. Romance appears in the form of Frances, a mentally fragile woman and an angel, with whom he tries to escape in this apocalyptic classic of Cuban literature.“Behind the hardly one hundred pages,” Canarias Diario stated, “is the work of a tireless fabulist, a writer who delights in language, extracting verbs and adjectives which are powerful enough to stop the reader in his tracks.”",0811218023,9780811218023),Paperback,,144 pages,"

Chiefly the story of the daughter -- her obsessions with and revulsions from sex, and her relations with two men, the one by morbid fascination and hate and love of a queer sort -- the other by appeal to her better nature.

Her man demanded loyalty, but her body wouldn’t obey.
Have you ever rolled over in the middle of the night and realized you were doing things you swore you’d never do? Sexing brothers you vowed you’d never touch? Bending backwards and stooping lower than you ever thought you’d stoop? Well if you can feel me even a little bit, then let me hit you with a story that just might blow your mind. . . .Nineteen-year-old Juicy Stanfield is the sexy young girlfriend of Granite “G” McKay, owner of Harlem’s notorious G-Spot Social Club. A drug dealer with a lethal streak, he runs Harlem with an iron fist. But even the cash and the bling can’t keep Juicy from getting restless, and while G fulfills her every material desire, she’s burning up with unrequited sexual energy. To cheat on him would mean a death sentence; so Juicy finds pleasure in secret ways: fantasizing on crowded subways or allowing her eyes to hungrily take in the male dancers on the club’s ladies night.But as Juicy’s sexual cravings grow stronger, one thing becomes frighteningly clear: She’s a virtual prisoner in G’s dangerous world. As G begins to suspect her of playin’ him, he pulls the reins he keeps on her even tighter. If she’s ever to escape and get a life of her own she must find a way to start stashing away some of G’s cash. But doing that under G’s watchful eye is a challenge she might not live up to–especially when her appetite tempts her with the deadliest desire of all: G’s very own son. . . .From the Trade Paperback edition.",0345486870,9780345486875),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Science of Survival The most useful book you will ever own. Built around the Hubbard Chart of Human Evaluation, Science of Survival provides the first accurate prediction of human behavior. Included on the chart are all the manifestations of an individual’s survival potential graduated from highest to lowest, making this the complete book on the Tone Scale. Knowing only one or two characteristics of a person and using this chart, you can plot his or her position on the Tone Scale and thereby know the rest, obtaining an accurate index of their entire personality, conduct and character.   Before this book the world was convinced that cases could not improve but only deteriorate. Science of Survival presents the idea of different states of case and the brand-new idea that one can progress upward on the Tone Scale.      ",0884044181,9780884044185),Hardcover,,626 pages,"

","In Kuwait, American forces are stacked up, locked and loaded for the invasion of Iraq. In Paris, a covert agent, a woman who inhabits a twilight of lies and death, is close to cracking a terrorist cell. And just north of the equator, a forty-foot wood-hulled sailboat, manned by a drug runner, a pirate, and two gun-slinging beauties, is witness to the unspeakable. In one instant, all around the world, for politicians and peasants, from Gaza to Geneva, things will never be the same. A wave of inexplicable energy has slammed into the continental United States.
America, as we know it, is gone. . . .

WITHOUT WARNING

Now U.S. soldiers are fighting a war without command or control. A correspondent records horrors for no one. Washington is gone and the line of succession is in tatters; the functioning remnants of government are in Pearl Harbor, Guantánamo Bay, and one desperate, isolated corner of the Northwest. For the jihadists, it’s Allah’s miracle. For Saddam, it’s a chance to attack. Iran declares war on an America that doesn’t exist–except in the hearts and souls of the men and women who want it to.In this astounding work of alternate fiction, John Birmingham hurtles us into a scenario that is unimaginable but shatteringly real: a world of financial ruin where a cloud of noxious waste–from America’s burning cities–darkens Europe, while men and women in offices around the globe struggle to make decisions that cannot hold and opportunists unleash their secret demons.From a slick Texas lawyer who happens to be in the right place at the right time to a hard-working city engineer in Seattle who becomes his terrified city’s only hope, from the cancer-stricken secret agent to a drug runner off the Mexican coast and a U.S. general in Cuba, Without Warning tells a fast, furious story of survival, violence, and a new, soul-shattering reality.",0345502892,9780345502896),Hardcover,,516 pages,"

While the town, with its legendary role in the Civil War’s worst battle, is no stranger to cemeteries, this one is remarkably, eerily different. In it lie 100 coffins—99 of them occupied by vampires, who, luckily, are missing their hearts. But one of the coffins is empty and smashed to pieces.Who is the missing vampire? Does he have access to the 99 hearts that, if placed back in the bodies of their owners, could reanimate an entire bloodthirsty army? How did the vampires end up there, undisturbed and undiscovered for 150 years? The answer lies in Civil War documents that contain sinister secrets about the newly found coffins—secrets that Laura Caxton is about to uncover as she is thrown into a deadly, gruesome mission of saving an entire town from a mass invasion of the undead…",0307381714,9780307381712),Paperback,,295 pages,"

","During the day, Morganville is just a small college town in the heart of Texas. But after dark, students like Claire Danvers know that studying can take a backseat to staying alive. Now together in one bloodthirsty volume, the second two books of the Morganville Vampires series show why underestimating a vampire can be deadly....MIDNIGHT ALLEYClaire Danvers has pledged herself to Amelie, the most powerful vampire in town. But being under Amelie's protection doesn't offer much comfort when people start turning up dead, a talker resurfaces from Claire's past, and an ancient bloodsucker extends a chilling invitation for private lessons at his secluded home in Midnight Alley. To what end, Claire will soon discover - and it will give a terrifying new meaning to night school.FEAST OF FOOLSIn Morganville, vampires and humans have learned to live in relative peace, but the tenuous good-neighbor policy is abruptly turned on its head with the arrival of Mr. Bishop. The ancient old-school vampire is bad to the bones, and what he wants from the town's living and dead is unthinkably sinister. It's only at a formal ball attended by vampires and their human dates that Claire realizes Bishop's plan - and the elaborately evil trap he's set for the warm-blooded souls of Morganville.",0451232895,9780451232892),Paperback,Omnibus Edition,448 pages,"

","Robert J. Sawyer, the award-winning and bestselling writer, hits the peak of his powers in Humans, the second book of The Neanderthal Parallax, his trilogy about our world and parallel one in which it was the Homo sapiens who died out and the Neanderthals who became the dominant intelligent species. This powerful idea allows Sawyer to examine some of the deeply rooted assumptions of contemporary human civilization dramatically, by confronting us with another civilization, just as morally valid, that has made other choices. In Humans, Neanderthal physicist Ponter Boddit, a character you will never forget, returns to our world and to his relationship with geneticist Mary Vaughan, as cultural exchanges between the two Earths begin.As we see daily life in another present-day world, radically different from ours, in the course of Sawyer's fast-moving story, we experience the bursts of wonder and enlightenment that are the finest pleasures of science fiction. Humans is one of the best SF novels of the year, and The Neanderthal Parallax is an SF classic in the making.Humans is a 2004 Hugo Award Nominee for Best Novel.",0765346753,9780765346759),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Chassée de son pays, la Pologne, l'héroïne traverse une Europe à feu et à sang et frôle les pires violences. Livrée aux hasards de l'errance, condition de vie des émigrés, ses aventures révèlent le cheminement souterrain de la perversité qui donne son titre au livre : souffrances, persécutions, arrestations, évasions, traitements odieux. Puis l'auteur opère une mutation du roman noir proprement dit à la science-fiction.

","A special book about the end of one life and the beginning of another.Life's That Way is a modern-day Book of Job. In August 2003, Jim Beaver, a character actor whom many know from the popular HBO series Deadwood, and his wife Cecily learned what they thought was the worst news possible- their daughter Maddie was autistic. Then six weeks later the roof fell in-Cecily was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer. Jim immediately began writing a nightly e-mail as a way to keep more than one hundred family and friends up to date about Cecily's condition. Soon four thousand people a day, from all around the world, were receiving them. Initially a cathartic exercise for Jim, the prose turned into an unforgettable journey for his readers. Cecily died four months after being diagnosed, but Jim continued the e-mails for a year after her diagnosis, revealing how he and Maddie coped with Cecily's death and how they managed to move forward. Life's That Way is a compilation of those nightly e-mails. Jim's experience is universal for anybody who has lost a loved one. But Life's That Way is not solely about loss. It is an immediate, day-by-day account of living through a nightmare but also of discovering the joy of a child, of being on the receiving end of unthinkable kindness, and of learning to navigate life anew. As Jim says, these are hard-won blessings. But then again, life's that way.",0399155643,9780399155642),Hardcover,,303 pages,"

Alone in the hands of ruthless killers, she will need every ounce of courage she possesses to survive. Betrayed by another operative, Deputy U.S. Marshal Zach McBride has endured a week of torture and interrogation at the hands of a bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartel. Ready to give his life if he must, he remains unbroken—until he hears the cries of an American woman. Although Natalie is only a voice in the darkness of their shared prison, her plight brings renewed strength to Zach's battered body. With her help, he overpowers their captors, and they flee through the desert toward the border, the attraction between them flaring hotter than the Sonoran sun.

","These are tough times for journalism. Newsroom executives' bonuses tend to be based on their company's profit margin. Journalists are constantly jockeying for the time and space necessary to tell their stories as they see fit. Only 47 percent of Americans even read a newspaper. And Time and Newsweek--news magazines, remember?--""were seven times more likely to have the same cover story as People magazine in 1997 than in 1977."" It's no wonder that in 1997, the Committee of Concerned Journalists formed to ""engage journalists and the public in a careful examination of what journalism was supposed to be."" The Elements of Journalism reports the results of that study, which included 21 public forums (attended by 3,000 people), in-depth interviews with 100 journalists, editorial content studies, and research into the history of journalism. Part of what the committee members learned, they already knew. Journalism is complicated business: journalists are paid by management but work for the citizens; they tend to be self-taught (there is little evidence of mentoring and much disdain for journalism schools); and they need to be objective even when they're not impartial. This has always been the case. But the committee also detected a trend, one abundantly evident to anyone who has tried to find news on the evening TV news: ""news was becoming entertainment and entertainment news."" ""Unless we can grasp and reclaim the theory of a free press,"" warn Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, the book's authors, ""journalists risk allowing their profession to disappear."" Through their discussions with journalists, the Committee of Concerned Journalists defined nine ""clear principles"" of journalism, which Kovach and Rosenstiel explore in great detail. The first principle is, ""Journalism's first obligation is to the truth."" The last: ""Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience."" In between come issues of loyalty, verification, independence, and power monitoring, among others. Invigorating reading for newsroom interns, jaded reporters, and anyone else who needs to be reminded of the rigorousness, integrity, and meaning of journalism. --Jane Steinberg",9799794528,9799794528,,,297 pages,"

His loyalty and commitment are unwavering until he recruits Dax, a captivating and challenging Bronzeman who, despite his youth and inexperience, seduces Maen with his fierce hero worship. When they’re captured by enemies of the City, Maen risks everything to save Dax: his position, his faith, and even his life. But he loses his lover to the rebels and upon his return to the City is stripped of his rank. In Aza, where a soldier’s only lawful devotion is to the City and his Mistress’s pleasure, the disgraced Maen is placed under the watchful guard of the arrogant Gold Warrior Zander and relegated to preparing a royal history for the new Queen. But his discoveries cast a new and shocking light on the past and threaten to stir revolution in both citizens and rebels.

","Huck is a page-turning, unforgettable true story of the tenacity of one small dog, the unexpected, extraordinary kindness of strangers, and a family’s devotion to each other.  Michael was four when his relentless campaign for a dog began. At seven he made a PowerPoint presentation, “My Dog,” with headings like “A Childhood Without a Dog is a Sad Thing.” His parents, Janet and Rich, were steadfast; bringing a dog into their fast-paced New York City lives was utterly impractical. However, on a trip to Italy, a chance happening leads Janet to reconsider, a decision then hastened by a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Janet decides the excitement of a new puppy would  be the perfect antidote to the strain on the family of months of arduous treatments for her illness. The prospect of a new puppy would be an affirmation of life, a powerful talisman for them all. On Thanksgiving weekend, soon after the grueling months of treatments are over, Huck, a sweet, mischievous, red-haired, toy poodle joins the family and wins everyone’s heart. A few months later the family ventures to baseball’s spring training, leaving Huck with Janet’s sister in Ramsey, New Jersey.  Barely twenty-four hours into the trip, Janet receives the dreaded phone call: Huck has slipped through the backyard fence and run away.  Broken-hearted and frantic, the family catches the first plane to New Jersey to begin a search for their lost puppy. It is a race against time, for little Huck is now lost in an area entirely unfamiliar to him, facing the threat of bears and coyotes, swamps and freezing temperatures, rain and fast cars.  Moved by the family’s plight, strangers – from school children to townspeople to the police lieutenant – join the search, one that proves to be an unyielding test of determination and faith. Touching and warm-hearted, Huck is a spirit-lifting story about resilience, the generosity of strangers, and hope.",0767931343,9780767931342),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","As a child in 1950s Czechoslovakia, Caldecott Honor-winning artist Peter Sís would listen to mysterious tales of Tibet, ""the roof of the world."" The narrator, oddly enough, was his father--a documentary filmmaker who had been separated from his crew, caught in a blizzard, and (according to him, anyway) nursed back to health by gentle Yetis. Young Sís learned of a beautiful land of miracles and monks beset by a hostile China; of the 14th Dalai Lama, a ""Boy-God-King""; and of ""a magic palace with a thousand rooms--a room for every emotion and heart's desire."" Hearing these accounts--some extravagant but all moving--helped the boy recover from an accident. The stories also allowed Sís's father to relate an odyssey other adults didn't seem to want to know about in cold war Czechoslovakia. ""He told me, over and over again, his magical stories of Tibet, for that is where he had been. And I believed everything he said,"" Sís recalls. Still, after some time he too seemed to become immune, and the stories ""faded to a hazy dream."" With Tibet: Through the Red Box Sís finally pays tribute to this fantastical experience, illustrating key pages from his father's diary with complex, color-rich images of mazes, mountains, and mandalas. He also produces pictures of his family at home--simple, monochromatic images that are just as haunting as their Himalayan counterparts. In one, a wistful mother and two children gather around a Christmas tree, the absent father appearing as a featureless silhouette. Tibet is a treasure for the eyes and heart. Some will ask: Is it for children or adults? Others will wonder: Is it a work of art or a storybook? One of the many things that this book makes us realize is that such classifications are entirely (and happily) unnecessary. --Kerry Fried",1865081574,9781865081571),Hardcover,,32 pages,"

","1978. A Roma le Brigate Rosse hanno rapito Aldo Moro, in Sicilia boss mafiosi come Gaetano Badalamenti soffocano ogni tentativo di resistenza civile, all’ombra della Madonnina le bande criminali di Vallanzasca e Turatello fanno salire la tensione in una città già segnata dagli scontri sociali. Ma anche in questo clima la dolcevita del capoluogo lombardo, che si prepara a diventare la «Milano da bere» degli anni Ottanta, non conosce soste. È proprio tra ristoranti di lusso, discoteche, bische clandestine e cabaret - dove cresce una nuova generazione di uomini di spettacolo destinata a rivoluzionare la comicità italiana - che fa i suoi affari un uomo enigmatico, affascinante, reso cinico da una menomazione inflittagli per uno «sgarbo». Si fa chiamare Bravo. Il suo settore sono le donne. Lui le vende. La sua vita è una lunga notte bianca che trascorre in compagnia di disperati, come l’amico Daytona. L’unico essere umano con cui pare avere un rapporto normale è un vicino di casa, Lucio, formidabile chitarrista cieco con cui condivide la passione per i crittogrammi. La comparsa improvvisa di una ragazza, Carla, che per sfuggire alla povertà decide di entrare nel giro della prostituzione, risveglia dolorosamente in Bravo sensazioni che l’handicap aveva messo a tacere. Ma per lui non è l’inizio di una nuova vita - che comunque gli sarebbe preclusa - bensì di un incubo che lo trasformerà in un uomo braccato dalla polizia, dalla malavita e da un’organizzazione terroristica. Incastrato come capro espiatorio in una serie di omicidi e in una strage efferata, per salvarsi non potrà contare che su se stesso. Il mondo, cui aveva cercato di sottrarsi scegliendo l’oscurità alla luce del giorno, lo risucchia mettendolo faccia a faccia con la violenza del proprio tempo. Qualcosa di molto più grosso di lui che fa sembrare acqua cristallina i suoi traffici sporchi.",8860735394,9788860735393),Hardcover,Romanzi e racconti Baldini Castoldi Dalai #513,397 pages,"

","John Kenneth Galbraith's international bestseller The Affluent Society is a witty, graceful and devastating attack on some of our most cherished economic myths.As relevant today as when it was first published over forty years ago, this newly updated edition of Galbraith's classic text on the 'economics of abundance', lays bare the hazards of individual and social complacency about economic inequality.Why worship work and productivity if many of the goods we produce are superfluous - artificial 'needs' created by high-pressure advertising? Why begrudge expenditure on vital public works while ignoring waste and extravagance in the private sector of the economy? Classical economics was born in a harsh world of mass poverty, and has left us with a set of preconceptions ill-adapted to the realities of our own richer age. And so, too often, 'the bland lead the bland'. Our unfamiliar problems need a new approach, and the reception given to this famous book has shown the value of its fresh, lively ideas.'A compelling challenge to conventional thought'  The New York Times'He shows himself a truly sensitive and civilized man, whose ideas are grounded in the common culture of the two continents, and may serve as a link between them; his book is of foremost importance for them both'  The Times Literary SupplementJohn Kenneth Galbraith (1908-2006) was a Canadian-American economist.

","The work of a lifetime, from one of the world's most influential thinkers, about the heart of the Christian faith. ""I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross. . . . In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?"" With compelling honesty John Stott confronts this generation with the centrality of the cross in God's redemption of the world -- a world now haunted by the memories of Auschwitz, the pain of oppression and the specter of nuclear war. Can we see triumph in tragedy, victory in shame? Why should an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith? And what does it mean for us today? Now from one of the foremost preachers and Christian leaders of our day comes theology at its readable best, a contemporary restatement of the meaning of the cross. At the cross Stott finds the majesty and love of God disclosed, the sin and bondage of the world exposed. More than a study of the atonement, this book brings Scripture into living dialogue with Christian theology and the twentieth century. What emerges is a pattern for Christian life and worship, hope and mission. Destined to be a classic study of the center of our faith, Stott's work is the product of a uniquely gifted pastor, scholar and Christian statesman. His penetrating insight, charitable scholarship and pastoral warmth are guaranteed to feed both heart and mind.",083083320X,9780830833207),Paperback,,380 pages,"

","En este libro, Marshall McLuhan extiende los conceptos de sus visionarios trabajos anteriores a la actual red electrónica universal. Cuando McLuhan publicó Understanding Media en 1964, no existían los medios de comunicación tal como los conocemos en la actualidad. Sin embargo, las extensiones tecnológicas de la conciencia humana se adelantaban a nuestra capacidad para comprender consecuencias, nunca ha sido tan apremiante. Y si el medio es el mensaje, el mensaje se está volviendo casi imposible de descifrar. En La Aldea Global, McLuhan y el coautor Bruce R. Powers proponen un marco conceptual detallado en cuyos términos pueden comprenderse los avances tecnológicos de las dos últimas teoría, se encuentra el argumento de que los usuarios de la tecnología están atrapados por dos formas distintas de percibir el mundo. Por un lado, está lo que ellos llaman Espacio Visual (la forma de percepción lineal, cuantitativa, característica del mundo occidental); por el otro, el Espacio Acústico (el razonamiento holístico, cualitativo, de Oriente). Los autores sostienen que el medio impreso estimula y conserva la percepción del espacio visual; sin embargo, al igual que la televisión, la tecnología de la base de datos, el satélite de comunicaciones y la red global de medios de comunicación están llevando a sus usuarios hacia una orientación más dinámica y ""con muchos núcleos"" del Espacio Acústico. Los autores nos advierten que este movimiento hacia el Espacio Acústico puede no ser gradual. De hecho, McLuhan y Powers sostienen que con el advenimiento de la globalización del entorno (el resultado de las comunicaciones mundiales) estos dos puntos de vista mundiales ""están chocando a la velocidad de la luz"" y aseguran que la ""clave para la paz es comprender estos dos sistemas en forma simultánea"". Al emplear el concepto de McLuhan del tétrade (una figura para predecir los cambios causados por nuevas tecnologías), los autores analizan esta colisión de puntos de vista. Sin tomar partido, tratan de hacer hoy lo que McLuhan hizo con éxito veinticinco años atrás: observar el mundo que vendrá y ayudarnos a estar preparados para lo que allí encontraremos.",8474324033,9788474324037),Paperback,1st edition El Mamifero Parlante.

","There is an ominous darkness; one that is so dense and mind-numbing that you can feel the chills race across your skin as the energy of its hatred hovers near you. They thought that it was over… that he was dead… they never imagined that he was more powerful dead than he ever was alive. The dark dimension Esterious is on the brink of war, the victory Willow had a few days ago is nothing more than a vague memory. With each thought she has, she fights the images of Drake’s dark eyes and his words… his promises. Doubt seeps into her soul as she faces what could be the hardest battle she has faced so far. Venus is meant to be the planet of love and peace… but when it falls into retrograde its influence changes. Matters of past relationships will surface, choices will be made with the mind and not the heart and gateways to an evil that cannot be fathomed will open. Willow and Landen’s only defense is to hide their family away, and lock themselves in the palace that was once ruled by Donalt. The energy is heavy and dark within its walls…there is a presence that lingers and strikes at will. Cruel illusions are placed before Willow, but that is not even the hardest part… what is hard is standing in a room with Drake and Landen and listening to others tell you of lives that you cannot recall… for them to tell you when and how you are going to die. Every prediction and theory is about to be proven wrong… and the choice before Willow’s heart holds the lives of millions at stake. The question is: will she be able to see through the illusions before her and make a choice… she can live with?",,,ebook,,263 pages,"

","Στους γάμους του Κάδμου και της Αρμονίας ήταν η τελευταία φορά όπου, με την ευκαιρία εκείνης της γιορτής, οι θεοί του Ολύμπου κάθισαν στο ίδιο τραπέζι με τους θνητούς. Όσα συνέβησαν πριν, στη διάρκεια πολλών αιώνων, και μετά, στη διάρκεια λίγων γενεών, διαμορφώνουν το τεράστιο και πολύφυλλο δέντρο της ελληνικής μυθολογίας, με εκείνες τις εκπληκτικές ιστορίες «που δεν συνέβησαν ποτέ, αλλά ανέκαθεν υπήρχαν». Κι επειδή ο καλύτερος τρόπος για να αναλογιστεί κανείς τους μύθους είναι να τους διηγηθεί, ο Ρομπέρτο Καλάσο, σ' αυτό το βιβλίο του που έχει μεταφραστεί σε όλο τον κόσμο, αφηγείται τις αρχαιοελληνικές ιστορίες από την αρχή, με τον δικό του τρόπο. Και βάζει τα ερωτήματά του: Γιατί οι θεοί του Ολύμπου πήραν ανθρώπινη μορφή και γιατί τη συγκεκριμένη μορφή; Γιατί οι ιστορίες τους είναι τόσο σκανδαλώδεις και τόσο σαγηνευτικές; Γιατί η εποχή των ηρώων ήταν τόσο σύντομη, ταραχώδης και ανεπανάληπτη; Και γιατί μας μαγεύουν ακόμη;",,,Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Amy Gallup is gifted, perhaps too gifted for her own good. Published at only twenty-two, she peaked early and found critical but not commercial success. Now her former life is gone, along with her writing career and beloved husband. A reclusive widow, her sole companion a dour, flatulent basset hound who barely tolerates her, her daily mantra Kill Me Now, she is a loner afraid to be alone. Her only bright spot each week is the writing class that she teaches at the university extension.This semester's class is full of the usual suspects: the doctor who wants to be the next Robin Cook, the overly enthusiastic repeat student, the slacker, the unassuming student with the hidden talent, the prankster, the know-it-all... Amy's seen them all before. But something is very different about this class—and the clues begin with a scary phone call in the middle of the night and obscene threats instead of peer evaluations on student writing assignments. Amy soon realizes that one of her students is a very sick puppy, and when a member of the class is murdered, everyone becomes a suspect. As she dissects each student's writing for clues, Amy must enlist the help of everyone in her class, including the murderer, to find the killer among them.Suspenseful, extremely witty, brilliantly written, unexpectedly hilarious, and a joy from start to finish, The Writing Class is a one-of-a-kind novel that rivals Jincy Willett's previous masterpieces.",0312330669,9780312330668),Hardcover,,326 pages,"

Beginning his travels in Indonesia, the idea of finding himself sounds appealing—but soon, he finds himself in real trouble. It starts with a bus crash on a terrifying mountain road. Lucky to escape with his life, Alex loses everything else—even his identity. But then he meets Domino, a beautiful girl who takes Alex under her wing. At first it's an intoxicating adventure, but Alex starts to realize that danger follows her around. As they approach the magnificent Lake Toba, and head to the remote community of free spirits that Domino calls home, it seems there's trouble in paradise. The ideals of the camp seem honorable—a simple life, shared by friends in a beautiful place hidden from the world. But Domino has no answers for the questions that are forming in Alex's mind: Why do the local villagers hate them so much? Why are people leaving the camp in the dead of night? And what are the strange shapes lurking just beyond the clearing? A taut, atmospheric and emotive thriller, Dark Horizons transports you to the lush landscapes of Sumatra, and the twisted ideals and deadly secrets lying in wait there.",1409108252,9781409108252),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","Dr. Amin Jaafari, an Arab-Israeli citizen, is a surgeon at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion, The Attack portrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.",0385517483,9780385517485),Hardcover,,257 pages,"

","It's important to choose our friends wisely, and relationships with man's best friend require a special kind of wisdom. Renowned veterinarian Bruce Fogle (Natural Dog Care) has compiled over 400 pages of helpful advice concerning canine companions, and those looking to learn more about their favorite breeds need look no further. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog's six chapters are filled with gorgeous photos illustrating dogs of all ages from every breed imaginable. While the majority of the book is devoted to explanations of specific breeds, five short chapters provide information on evolution, domestication, health and anatomy, communication, and the roles dogs have played in recent human history. With historical photographs of tapestries, ceramics, and movie posters, as well as intricate diagrams of canine anatomy and charts outlining proper health care, these chapters provide great material for middle-school research papers or science-fair projects. The 310 pages that fall within the ""Domestic Dog Breed"" chapter are further divided into nine categories of dogs that range from fascinating primitives to hard-working livestock and guarding dogs. Each breed has multiple photos, both as an adult and a puppy, and a standard set of information that includes size, weight, life expectancy, date and country of origin, and AKC registration. A few simple icons, explained in this chapter's introduction, provide you with information at a glance--when learning about new breeds, you'll know right away if the dog requires extensive grooming and plenty of exercise, or is suitable for small children and city dwelling. From the popular golden retriever to the exotic xoloitzcuintli, the perfect pooches in these photos would melt even the heart of Cruella DeVille. --Jill Lightner",0751304719,9780751304718),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","In June 1861, when the Civil War began, Charley Goddard enlisted in the First Minnesota Volunteers. He was 15. He didn't know what a ""shooting war"" meant or what he was fighting for. But he didn't want to miss out on a great adventure. The ""shooting war"" turned out to be the horror of combat and the wild luck of survival; how it feels to cross a field toward the enemy, waiting for fire. When he entered the service he was a boy. When he came back he was different; he was only 19, but he was a man with ""soldier's heart,"" later known as ""battle fatigue.""",0440228387,9780440228387),Paperback,,128 pages,"

","In the fall of 1611, John Guy prepares to return from his colony in Cupers Cove, Newfoundland, to Bristol, England, where he plans to woo Eliza Egret, the daughter of one of the principal stockholders of the colonization venture. Guy must return, however, with a prisoner, a mysterious young man named Bartholomew, who is responsible for burning the colony’s stored grain. As the presence of a convict might cause the backers to question his leadership, Guy chooses a radical course — to use the silken-tongued Bartholomew as an ally. So Guy and his companion enter a tale of intrigue and danger reminiscent of the revenge tragedies of the Jacobean period.Longlisted for the 2011 ReLit Awards",189731762X,9781897317624),Paperback,,183 pages,"

The Duke of Montague's daughter, Eleanor, is exquisitely beautiful and fiercely intelligent. Villiers betroths himself to her without further ado.After all, no other woman really qualifies. Lisette, the outspoken daughter of the Duke of Gilner, cares nothing for clothing or decorum. She's engaged to another man, and doesn't give a fig for status or title. Half the ton believes Lisette mad—and Villiers is inclined to agree.Torn between logic and passion, between intelligence and imagination, Villiers finds himself drawn to the very edge of impropriety.

","It's easy to say ghosts exist or don't exist. Anyone can do that. Trying to figure out the why or what is a different story. Paranormal investigator Zak Bagans, host of the popular Travel Channel series Ghost Adventures, pulls from his years of experience with paranormal activities and unexplained phenomena to provide an evenhanded look at a divisive subject. In Dark World, regardless of whether you believe in the afterlife or not, Zak does his best to find and share answers to the phenomena that people encounter. He wants you to experience a haunting through his eyes: to feel what it's like to be scared, freaked out, pushed, cold, sluggish, whispered-at and touched by an ethereal being or attacked by a demonic spirit. But beyond simply experiencing these events, Zak is looking for the reasons behind them, searching for answers to the unanswered questions. Addressing all the major issues and theories of the field in an impartial way, Dark World is a must read for paranormal enthusiasts, those who don't believe and anyone who's ever wondered about things that go bump in the night.",1936608855,9781936608850),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

Not only is she surrounded by beautiful, powerful, immortal classmates, but she also has snakes for hair and a reputation for being mean. Immortality, she thinks, will solve everything. So when she finds out about a necklace that promises just that, she’s sure it will help her get the two things she covets most: to be as popular as the four Goddess Girls and to have her supercrush, Poseidon, finally notice her. But when the necklace brings about popularity in the totally wrong way, things go from bad to worse. Can Medusa overcome her “meanie” status and prove that there’s more to her that meets the eye?",1442433795,9781442433793),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Part of the Knights of the Board Room series. Rachel gave up seeking a Master years ago. After a failed marriage and terrible tragedy, she's walled her soul against going down that dangerous path again. Then Jon joins her yoga class. He's thirteen years younger than she, but his Dominant nature threatens her shields from the moment she recognizes it. Not only does he understand what her body wants-he knows what her soul craves. Part of the five-man executive team of Kensington & Associates, Jon uses his calm, philosophical nature to defuse volatile acquisition negotiations. He can compel opponents to willingly surrender when he draws the sword that closes the deal. As a sexual Dominant, he employs that same expertise. A spiritually driven Master who enjoys connecting with a woman's soul, he wins her utter submission with his skills. But with Rachel, it goes beyond that. She's the submissive his own soul has always hungered to have, and he won't hesitate to use his talents, as well as that of the other four K&A men, to claim her.

","Boethius (Boetius)--Anicius Manlius Severinus--Roman statesman and philosopher (ca. 480-524 CE), was son of Flavius Manlius Boetius, after whose death he was looked after by several men, especially Memmius Symmachus. He married Symmachus's daughter, Rusticiana, by whom he had two sons. All three men rose to high honours under Theodoric the Ostrogoth, but Boethius fell from favour, was tried for treason, wrongly condemned, and imprisoned at Ticinum (Pavia), where he wrote his renowned The Consolation of Philosophy. He was put to death in 524, to the great remorse of Theodoric. Boethius was revered as if he were a saint and his bones were removed in 996 to the Church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, and later to the Cathedral. The tower in Pavia where he was imprisoned is still venerated.Boethius was author of Latin translations of Aristotle, commentaries on various philosophical works, original works on logic, five books on music, and other works. His The Consolation of Philosophy is the last example of purely literary Latin of ancient times--a mingling of alternate dialogue and poems.

","From one of our most widely read, award-winning journalists – comes the powerful, unputdownable story of the very human cost of a global pandemic of staggering scope and scale. It is essential reading for our times.In 28, Stephanie Nolen, the Globe and Mail’s Africa Bureau Chief, puts a human face to the crisis created by HIV-AIDS in Africa. She has achieved, in this amazing book, something extraordinary: she writes with a power, understanding and simplicity that makes us listen, makes us understand and care. Through riveting anecdotal stories – one for each of the million people living with HIV-AIDS in Africa – Nolen explores the effects of an epidemic that well exceeds the Black Plague in magnitude. It is a calamity that is unfolding just a 747-flight away, and one that will take the lives of these 28 million without the help of massive, immediate intervention on an unprecedented scale. 28 is a timely, transformative, thoroughly accessible book that shows us definitively why we continue to ignore the growth of HIV-AIDS in Africa only at our peril and at an intolerable moral cost.28’s stories are much more than a record of the suffering and loss in 28 emblematic lives. Here we meet women and men fighting vigorously on the frontlines of disease: Tigist Haile Michael, a smart, shy 14-year-old Ethiopian orphan fending for herself and her baby brother on the slum streets of Addis Ababa; Alice Kadzanja, an HIV-positive nurse in Malawi, where one in six adults has the virus, and where the average adult’s life expectancy is 36; and Zackie Achmat, the hero of South Africa’s politically fragmented battle against HIV-AIDS. 28 also tells us how the virus works, spreads and, ultimately, kills. It explains the connection of HIV-AIDS to conflict, famine and the collapse of states; shows us how easily treatment works for those lucky enough to get it and details the struggles of those who fight to stay alive with little support. It makes vivid the strong, desperate people doing all they can, and maintaining courage, dignity and hope against insurmountable odds. It is – in its humanity, beauty and sorrow – a call to action for all who read it.",0676978223,9780676978223),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","From childhood dreams of prostitution to her unabashed passion for heavy drinking, from growing up wide-eyed on the set of Australian soaps to her infatuation with Bob Ellis, these are the outrageously entertaining and deeply revealing reminiscences of a multimedia star.From stalking and eventually meeting her Young Talent Time idol when she was twelve, to a particularly abhorrent encounter at a high-quality swingers night, and a mildly perverse obsession with Bob Ellis, there is nothing Marieke Hardy won't write about. Welcome to a chronicle of broken hearts, fervid pursuits, passionate friendships, deranged letter-writing, the allure of the bottle, the singular charms of musicians, the lost song of youth, and three very awkward evenings with varying prostitutes--exactly zero percent of which the author's parents will want to read. Add to that a slightly misguided attempt to give real-life friends and ex-lovers a 'right of reply' to the stories they appear in and it's fair to say an extended stint in the Witness Protection Program beckons.Confessional, voyeuristic, painful, hilarious and heartfelt, You'll Be Sorry When I'm Dead reveals the acerbic wit, unflinching gaze and razor-sharp insight of a writer at the height of her powers-or the unhinged fantasies of a dangerous mind with not enough to do.",1742377262,9781742377261),Mass Market Paperback,,304 pages,"

","The real war,"" said Walt Whitman, ""will never get in the books."" During World War II, the truest glimpse most Americans got of the ""real war"" came through the flashing black lines of twenty-two-year-old infantry sergeant Bill Mauldin. Week after week, Mauldin defied army censors, German artillery, and Patton's pledge to ""throw his ass in jail"" to deliver his wildly popular cartoon, ""Up Front,"" to the pages of Stars and Stripes. ""Up Front"" featured the wise-cracking Willie and Joe, whose stooped shoulders, mud-soaked uniforms, and pidgin of army slang and slum dialect bore eloquent witness to the world of combat and the men who lived—and died—in it.This taut, lushly illustrated biography—the first of two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Mauldin—is illustrated with more than ninety classic Mauldin cartoons and rare photographs. It traces the improbable career and tumultuous private life of a charismatic genius who rose to fame on his motto: ""If it's big, hit it.",0393050319,9780393050318),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

Mr. Darcy just isn't Flip Allison's style. She prefers novels with hot sex on the bathroom sink to the mannerly, high-tension longing of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. That is, until she pays a visit to Madame K, who promises a therapeutic massage with an opportunity to ""Imagine Yourself in Your Favorite Book."" Somehow, on the way to a sizzling sink-top session with a Venetian Adonis, Flip lands right in the middle of Regency England -- and dangerously close to handsome Mr. Darcy. So close, in fact, that she discovers a side of him even Jane Austen couldn't have imagined.  Waking from her massage, Flip is on top of the world and ready for her upcoming book club -- that is, until she notices a new scene in which Darcy and spunky heroine Lizzy Bennet are arguing over...Flip Allison? Her rapturous liaison with Darcy has had disastrous consequences for Austen's characters -- not to mention millions of Pride and Prejudice fans! Flip has twenty-four hours to put the story back on course, and Magnus Knightley, a sexy but imperious scholar whose brooding good looks and infuriating arrogance are decidedly Darcy-like, is the only one who can help. The only problem is, Flip can't keep her hands off him, either....",1416541160,9781416541165),Paperback,,374 pages,"

","In the four short years since publication, the first edition of ""The English Teacher's Companion"" quickly became the instructional bible for English teachers. Covering the entire English curriculum, from basic reading and writing to digital literacy, media literacy, and integrated instruction, it proved to be a revolutionary guide for preservice and inservice teachers alike. And with it author Jim Burke became one of the most trusted names in secondary English.Now, in this new edition, ""ETC""2, Jim incorporates his current thinking. He also shows how teachers can address standards and assessment issues while maintaining their commitment to meaningful, engaging curriculum. With all this, plus updated revisions and 40 percent completely new material, his ""ETC2"" is a must-have addition to every English teacher's bookshelf.Written for the way most teachers read-on the run, in search of a particular solution-the second edition retains the original's highly structured format with a new more open design for ease of use.

","Welcome to the bizarre and dangerous world of Victorian London, a city teetering on the edge of revolution. Its people are ushering in a new era of technology, dazzled each day by new inventions. Airships soar in the skies over the city, whilst ground trains rumble through the streets and clockwork automatons are programmed to carry out menial tasks in the offices of lawyers, policemen and journalists. But beneath this shiny veneer of progress lurks a sinister side. For this is also a world where ghostly policemen haunt the fog-laden alleyways of Whitechapel, where cadavers can rise from the dead and where Sir Maurice Newbury, Gentleman Investigator for the Crown, works tirelessly to protect the Empire from her foes. When an airship crashes in mysterious circumstances, Sir Maurice and his recently appointed assistant Miss Veronica Hobbes are called in to investigate. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard is baffled by a spate of grisly murders and a terrifying plague is ravaging the slums of the city. So begins an adventure quite unlike any other, a thrilling steampunk mystery and the first in the series of ""Newbury & Hobbes"" investigations.",190500589X,9781905005895),Hardcover,,350 pages,"

","A timely and captivating novel about a mother whose life spirals out of control when she descends into alcoholism, and her battle to get sober and regain custody of her beloved son.Cadence didn’t sit down one night and decide that downing two bottles of wine was a brilliant idea.Her drinking snuck up on her—as a way to sleep, to help her relax after a long day, to relieve some of the stress of the painful divorce that’s left her struggling to make ends meet with her five-year old son, Charlie. It wasn’t always like this. Just a few years ago, Cadence seemed to have it all—a successful husband, an adorable son, and a promising career as a freelance journalist. But with the demise of her marriage, her carefully constructed life begins to spiral out of control. Suddenly she is all alone trying to juggle the demands of work and motherhood.Logically, Cadence knows that she is drinking too much, and every day begins with renewed promises to herself that she will stop. But within a few hours, driven by something she doesn’t understand, she is reaching for the bottle—even when it means not playing with her son because she is too tired, or dropping him off at preschool late, again. And even when one calamitous night it means leaving him alone to pick up more wine at the grocery store. It’s only when her ex-husband shows up at her door to take Charlie away that Cadence realizes her best kept secret has been discovered….Heartbreaking, haunting, and ultimately life-affirming, Best Kept Secret is more than just the story of Cadence—it’s a story of how the secrets we hold closest are the ones that can most tear us apart.",1439193312,9781439193310),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Evan Thomas takes us inside the naval war of 1941-1945 in the South Pacific in a way that blends the best of military and cultural history and riveting narrative drama. He follows four men throughout: Admiral William (""Bull"") Halsey, the macho, gallant, racist American fleet commander; Admiral Takeo Kurita, the Japanese battleship commander charged with making what was, in essence, a suicidal fleet attack against the American invasion of the Philippines; Admiral Matome Ugaki, a self-styled samurai who was the commander of all kamikazes and himself the last kamikaze of the war; and Commander Ernest Evans, a Cherokee Indian and Annapolis graduate who led his destroyer on the last great charge in the last great naval battle in history.""Sea of Thunder"" climaxes with the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the biggest naval battle ever fought, over four bloody and harrowing days in October 1944. We see Halsey make an epic blunder just as he reaches for true glory; we see the Japanese navy literally sailing in circles, torn between the desire to die heroically and the exhausted, unacceptable realization that death is futile; we sail with Commander Evans and the men of the USS ""Johnston"" into the jaws of the Japanese fleet and exult and suffer with them as they torpedo a cruiser, bluff and confuse the enemy -- and then, their ship sunk, endure fifty horrific hours in shark-infested water.Thomas, a journalist and historian, traveled to Japan, where he interviewed veterans of the Imperial Japanese Navy who survived the Battle of Leyte Gulf and friends and family of the two Japanese admirals. From new documents and interviews, he was able to piece together and answer mysteries about the Battle of LeyteGulf that have puzzled historians for decades. He writes with a knowing feel for the clash of cultures.""Sea of Thunder"" is a taut, fast-paced, suspenseful narrative of the last great naval war, an important contribution to the history of the Second World War.",0743252217,9780743252218),Hardcover,,415 pages,"

","On Moral Fiction set off a firestorm of controversy when it was first published in 1978. With a daring not obscured by the author’s extraordinary humaneness of spirit, the book argued that contemporary literature suffers first and foremost from a basic failure of the test of “morality.” By “moral fiction” the author meant fiction that attempts to test human values, not for the purpose of preaching or peddling a particular ideology or mode of conduct, but in a honest and open-minded effort to find out what best promotes human fulfillment. Such writing does so, as great artists beginning with Homer have always known, by the kind of analysis of characters and actions that brings both the writer and the reader to a fuller understanding, sympathy, and vision of human possibility. Because so much contemporary fiction fails to be moral in this sense, John Gardner argued, it undermines our experience of literature and our faith in ourselves. This bold argument is driven forward as the author subjects the work of his most celebrated contemporaries, such as Saul Bellow, Norman Mailer, John Updike, and Donald Barthelme to his sharp-eyed and relentless analysis. Although the last three decades have seen the rise of new generations of writers, and the ascendancy of postmodern modes of composition, On Moral Fiction still sets out the terms of a more ancient sense of the novelist’s calling. It is a salutary counterweight to prevailing trends. Praise for On Moral Fiction:  “On Moral Fiction is criticism with both eyes open, fearless, illuminating, proving that the concern of thecritic is with art, that true art is moral and not trivial, that it and the discussion of it can give pleasure—of a sort that lasts and re-echoes.”— Robert Kirsch, Los Angeles Times “Because Gardner’s anger is honest and wholesome, the criticism of his contemporaries never descends to mere vindictiveness or gossip.”—Max Apple, The Nation  “A thoughtful, amusing and arrogant little book, designed to pick fights.""—Webster Schott, The Washington Post Book World",1435107780,9781435107786),Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","The Divide was a place that seemed to want to keep itself secret. It perched concealed at the head of a split and tortuous valley that descended to another far grander. Montana had ritzier ranches, with finer cuisine and glitzier guests. But there were few, if any, so beautiful. Its guests came by word of mouth and returned again and again. ... more » And thus it was with the Cooper family. For the last two weeks in June, they always took cabins six and eight. This was their fourth visit and it would be their last, the vacation that would change their lives forever.On a crystalline Montana morning, two backcountry skiers find the body of a young women embedded in the ice of a remote mountain creek. All through the night police work with floodlights and chainsaws to extract her. Identifying her, however, takes no time at all. Abbie Cooper is wanted for murder and acts of ecoterrorism, and her picture is on law enforcement computers all across the country. But how did she die? And what was the trail of events that led this golden child of a loving family so tragically astray?A devastating journey of discovery that extends from the streets of New York to the daunting grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, The Divide tells the story of a family fractured by betrayal and struggling in search of lost happiness. It explores the pain we inflict on those we love the most, and charts the passions and needs, the dashed hopes and disillusionments that connect and divide all men and women.",0451219295,9780451219299),Mass Market Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Why do some people age in failing health and sadness, while others grow old with vitality and joy?

In this revolutionary book, bestselling author John Robbins presents us with a bold new paradigm of aging, showing us how we can increase not only our lifespan but also our health span. Through the example of four very different cultures that have the distinction of producing some of the world’s healthiest, oldest people, Robbins reveals the secrets for living an extended and fulfilling life in which our later years become a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness. From Abkhasia in the Caucasus south of Russia, where age is beauty, and Vilcabamba in the Andes of South America, where laughter is the greatest medicine, to Hunza in Central Asia, where dance is ageless, and finally the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa, the modern Shangri-la, where people regularly live beyond a century, Robbins examines how the unique lifestyles of these peoples can influence and improve our own.Bringing the traditions of these ancient and vibrantly healthy cultures together with the latest breakthroughs in medical science, Robbins reveals that, remarkably, they both point in the same direction. The result is an inspirational synthesis of years of research into healthy aging in which Robbins has isolated the characteristics that will enable us to live long and–most important–joyous lives. With an emphasis on simple, wholesome, but satisfying fare, and the addition of a manageable daily exercise routine, many people can experience great improvement in the quality of their lives now and for many years to come. But perhaps more surprising is Robbins’ discovery that it is not diet and exercise alone that helps people to live well past one hundred. The quality of personal relationships is enormously important. With startling medical evidence about the effects of our interactions with others, Robbins asserts that loneliness has more impact on lifespan than such known vices as smoking. There is clearly a strong beneficial power to love and connection.“We all have the tools to live longer lives, and to remain active, productive, and resourceful until the very end,” Robbins writes. Healthy at 100 strives to improve both the quality and the quantity of our remaining years–no matter how old or how healthy we might currently be–and to reverse the social stigma on aging. After reading this book, we will never think about age–or life–in the same way again.“John Robbins has inspired millions of people with his eloquent, clear, compassionate, and insightful guidance on the path to health and fulfillment. Healthy at 100 may be his finest work to date. If you are interested in extending your health span as well as your life span, read this book! Healthy at 100 is a masterpiece.”–Dean Ornish, M.D., president and director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, author of Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease“This is a remarkably open and heartfelt book full of wisdom and love by an extraordinary man who has been teaching us how to live more healthy and compassionate lives for over twenty years now. John Robbins has created a new vision of aging for American society.”–John Mackey, CEO, Whole Foods“John Robbins is one of the most important voices in America today. He cuts through nonsense like no one else does. He gives hope like no one else does. His words are lifelines for both the body and soul. This book can literally save our lives.”–Marianne Williamson, author of A Return to Love and A Woman’s Worth“Healthy at 100 is a marvelous blend of wisdom, hope, courage, and common sense. John Robbins gives us caring, science, and inspiration–a beautiful diet for the heart.”–Jack Kornfield, co-founder of the Insight Meditation Society and Spirit Rock, author of A Path with Heart“As the low-carb diet craze is gone, John Robbins proposes a far healthier approach that leads not just to a healthy weight but also to a joyful and fulfilled life. Healthy at 100 is packed with informed and heartfelt wisdom.”–Jorge Cruise, author of The 3-Hour Diet, creator of JorgeCruise.com

","Lushly written with rich and vivid characters, SANTA OLIVIA is Jacqueline Carey's take on comic book superheroes and the classic werewolf myth. Loup Garron was born and raised in Santa Olivia, an isolated, disenfranchised town next to a US military base inside a DMZ buffer zone between Texas and Mexico. A fugitive ""Wolf-Man"" who had a love affair with a local woman, Loup's father was one of a group of men genetically-manipulated and used by the US government as a weapon. The ""Wolf-Men"" were engineered to have superhuman strength, speed, sensory capability, stamina, and a total lack of fear, and Loup, named for and sharing her father's wolf-like qualities, is marked as an outsider. After her mother dies, Loup goes to live among the misfit orphans at the parish church, where they seethe from the injustices visited upon the locals by the soldiers. Eventually, the orphans find an outlet for their frustrations: They form a vigilante group to support Loup Garron who, costumed as their patron saint, Santa Olivia, uses her special abilities to avenge the town. Aware that she could lose her freedom, and possibly her life, Loup is determined to fight to redress the wrongs her community has suffered. And like the reincarnation of their patron saint, she will bring hope to all of Santa Olivia.",044619817X,9780446198172),Paperback,,341 pages,"

But Lee Iacocca didn't get mad, he got even. He led a battle for Chrysler's survival that made his name a symbol of integrity, know-how, and guts for millions of Americans.In his classic hard-hitting style, he tells us how he changed the automobile industry in the 1960s by creating the phenomenal Mustang. He goes behind the scenes for a look at Henry Ford's reign of intimidation and manipulation.

How about when you realize your own insignificant other is becoming more significant than your spouse?There are no easy answers to these questions, but Stephen McCauley--""the master of the modern comedy of manners"" (""USA Today"")--makes exploring them a literary delight.Richard Rossi works in HR at a touchy-feely software company and prides himself on his understanding of the foibles and fictions we all use to get through the day. Too bad he's not as good at spotting such behavior in himself.What else could explain his passionate affair with Benjamin, a very unavailable married man? Richard suggests birthday presents for Benjamin's wife and vacation plans for his kids, meets him for ""lunch"" at a sublet apartment, and would never think about calling him after business hours.""In the three years I'd known Benjamin, I'd come to think of him as ""my husband."" He was, after all, ""a ""husband, and I saw it as my responsibility to protect his marriage from a barrage of outside threats and bad influences. It was the only way I could justify sleeping with him.""Since Richard is not entirely available himself--there's Conrad, his adorable if maddening partner to contend with--it all seems perfect. But when cosmopolitan Conrad starts spending a suspicious amount of time in Ohio, and economic uncertainty challenges Richard's chances for promotion, he realizes his priorities might be a little skewed.With a cast of sharply drawn friends, frenemies, colleagues, and personal trainers, ""Insignificant Others ""is classic McCauley--a hilarious and ultimately haunting social satire about life in the United States at the bitter end of the boom years, when clinging to significant people and pursuits has never been more important--if only one could figure out what they are.",0743224752,9780743224758),Hardcover,,243 pages,"

But when her mother, Mami, a force of nature, takes off to New York with her seven, soon to be eleven children, Esmeralda, the oldest, must learn new rules, a new language, and eventually a new identity.

When she proves promising enough to be “Extracted,” she must leave without Logan, the boy she loves. Torn apart from her only sense of family, Clem promises to come back and save him from brutal Surface life.What she finds initially in the Core is a utopia compared to the Surface—it’s free of hard labor, gun-wielding officials, and the moon's lethal acid. But life is anything but safe, and Clementine learns that the planet's leaders are planning to exterminate Surface dwellers—and that means Logan, too. Trapped by the steel walls of the underground and the lies that keep her safe, Clementine must find a way to escape and rescue Logan and the rest of the planet. But the planet leaders don't want her running—they want her subdued.With intense action scenes and a cast of unforgettable characters, Extraction is a page-turning, gripping read, sure to entertain lovers of Hunger Games and Ender's Game and leave them breathless for more.",1250041171,9781250041173),Hardcover,,406 pages,"

","Fans of Will Self's satirical fiction and stunning prose will not be disappointed in the latest from the author who brought readers through the bizarre war between the sexes in Cock & Bull and into the costly world of high-stakes business in My Idea of Fun. With Great Apes, Self takes readers into a sort of ""Planet of the Apes"" with a twist. Simon Dykes is a London painter whose life suddenly becomes Kafkaesque. After an evening of routine debauchery, traipsing from toilet to toilet and partaking in a host of narcotics, the middle-aged painter wakes to discover that his girlfriend, Sarah, has turned into a chimpanzee. Simon is also a chimp, but he does not accept this fact—he is convinced that he is still human.He is then confined to an emergency psychiatric ward and placed under the care of alpha-psychiatrist Dr. Zack Busner. Simon finds chimp behavior a bit unnatural; he can't bring himself to use gestures rather than speech to communicate. He also finds it difficult to mate publicly or accept social grooming. Dr. Zack Busner—also a medical doctor, radical psychoanalyst, maverick axiolytic drug researcher, and former television personality—is prepared to help Simon get used to ""chimpunity"". It is during Simon's gradual simianization that Self's true satirical genius shines, as he examines anthropology, the trendy art world, animal rights, and much more.",0802135765,9780802135766),Paperback,,404 pages,"

But as the New York Times Book Review raved, Barnett and Rivers ""debunk these theories in a no-nonsense way, offering a refreshingly direct (i.e. unashamedly judgmental) critique of traditional parental roles, tututting at the couples they interviewed who cling to stereotyped ideas of the family."" ""Blending case histories, new research and thoughtful analysis, the writers describe the divide between the sexes as a crevice, not a chasm. The good news: We're all a lot more flexible than the gender clich8Es let on.""-Psychology Today",0465006132,9780465006137),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Book One in the Marseilles TrilogyUgo, Manu, and Fabio grew up together on the mean streets of Marseilles, where friendship means everything. They promised to stay true to one another and swore that nothing would break their bond. But people and circumstances change. Ugo and Manu have been drawn into the criminal underworld of Europe's toughest, most violent and vibrant city. When Manu is murdered and Ugo returns from abroad to avenge his friend's death, only to be killed himself, it is left to the third in this trio, Detective Fabio Montale, to ensure justice is done. Despite warnings from both his colleagues in law enforcement and his acquaintances in the underworld, Montale cannot forget the promise he once made Manu and Ugo. He's going to find their killer even if it means going too far.In Izzo's novels, Marseilles is explosive, tragic, breathtakingly beautiful and deadly. Asked to explain the astounding success of his now legendary Marseilles triology, Izzo credits his beloved native city: ""Essentially, I think I have been rewarded for having depicted the real beauty of Marseilles, its gusto, its passion for life, and the ability of its inhabitants to drink life down to the last drop."" Fabio Montale is the perfect protagonist in this city of melancholy beauty. A disenchanted cop with an inimitable talent for living who turns his back on a police force marred by corruption and racism and, in the name of friendship, takes the fight against the mafia into his own hands.",1933372044,9781933372044),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Philosophy of Existence was first presented to the public as a series of lectures invited by The German Academy of Frankfurt. In preparing these lectures Jaspers, whom the Nazis had already dismissed from his professorship at Heidelberg, knew that he was speaking in Germany for the last time. Jaspers used the occasion to offer an account of the cultural and intellectual situation from which existentialism emerged as well as a summary of his own philosophy.The book serves three purposes today: it brings the many strands of the existential movement into focus; it provides an overview of Jaspers's own philosophical position; and it demonstrates by example that philosophy need not be irrational, antiscientific, journalistic, or homiletic in order to be existential and engage. In this short book Jaspers provides a corrective for the popular view of existentialism as a pessimistic, irrationalist philosophy. He maintains that it is, rather part of mainstream of Western philosophy--the form that philosophy has taken in our day.",0812210107,9780812210101),Paperback,,128 pages,"

","Runner-up, 2006 Arab American National Museum Book Awards, 2007The ""evil"" Arab has become a stock character in American popular films, playing the villain opposite American ""good guys"" who fight for ""the American way."" It's not surprising that this stereotype has entered American popular culture, given the real-world conflicts between the United States and Middle Eastern countries, particularly since the oil embargo of the 1970s and continuing through the Iranian hostage crisis, the first and second Gulf Wars, and the ongoing struggle against al-Qaeda. But when one compares the ""evil"" Arab of popular culture to real Arab people, the stereotype falls apart. In this thought-provoking book, Tim Jon Semmerling further dismantles the ""evil"" Arab stereotype by showing how American cultural fears, which stem from challenges to our national ideologies and myths, have driven us to create the ""evil"" Arab Other.Semmerling bases his argument on close readings of six films (The Exorcist, Rollover, Black Sunday, Three Kings, Rules of Engagement, and South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut), as well as CNN's 9/11 documentary America Remembers. Looking at their narrative structures and visual tropes, he analyzes how the films portray Arabs as threatening to subvert American ""truths"" and mythic tales--and how the insecurity this engenders causes Americans to project evil character and intentions on Arab peoples, landscapes, and cultures. Semmerling also demonstrates how the ""evil"" Arab narrative has even crept into the documentary coverage of 9/11. Overall, Semmerling's probing analysis of America's Orientalist fears exposes how the ""evil"" Arab of American popular film is actually an illusion that reveals more about Americans than Arabs.",0292713428,9780292713420),Paperback,,303 pages,"

","#1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts introduces you to the Montgomery brothers - Beckett, Ryder, and Owen - as they bring an intimate bed-and-breakfast to life in their hometown.Ryder is the hardest Montgomery brother to figure out - with a tough-as-nails outside and possibly nothing too soft underneath. He's surly and unsociable, but when he straps on a toolbelt, no woman can resist his sexy swagger. Except, apparently, Hope Beaumont, the innkeeper of his own Inn BoonsBoro...As the former manager of a D.C. hotel, Hope is used to excitement and glamour, but that doesn't mean she can't appreciate the joys of small-town living. She's where she wants to be - except for in her love life. Her only interaction with the opposite sex has been sparring with the infuriating Ryder, who always seems to get under her skin. Still, no one can deny the electricity that crackles between them...a spark that ignited with a New Year's Eve kiss.While the inn is running smoothly, thanks to Hope's experience and unerring instincts, her big-city past is about to make an unwelcome - and embarrassing - appearance. Seeing Hope vulnerable stirs up Ryder's emotions and makes him realize that while Hope may not be perfect, she just might be perfect for him...",1455807044,9781455807048),MP3 CD,Unabridged,,"

There are some who say that the Lady Fortune has a wheel, and all men are fixed upon it. The wheel turns, and the men rise, or fall, with the turning of the wheel.

 Birle has agreed to be wed to the huntsman Muir as an escape from the drudgery of life at her father's inn -- but the moment she looks into the bellflower blue eyes of the man she comes upon stealing one of her father's boats, Birle knows she cannot marry Muir. Even after she discovers the mysterious stranger is Orien, a Lord and as unreachable to an innkeeper's daughter as a star, Birle is determined to travel with him as far as he will allow.  Their travels take Birle to a world far from home, a world where Lords may become slaves, where Princes rule by fear, and where Fortune's Wheel turns more swiftly and dangerously than Birle could have imagined.  Newberry Medalist Cynthia Voigt's second novel of the Kingdom, set two generations later than Jackaroo, is a memorable combination of thrilling adventure and heart-stopping romance.",0689829574,9780689829574),Paperback,,402 pages,"

","Nietzsche's notebooks, kept by him during his most productive years, offer a fascinating glimpse into the workshop and mind of a great thinker, and compare favorably with the notebooks of Gide and Kafka, Camus and Wittgenstein. The Will to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the most famous books of the past hundred years, but few have studied it. Here, at last, is the first critical edition in any language.Down through the Nazi period The Will to Power was often mistakenly considered to be Nietzsche's crowning systematic labor; since World War II it has frequently been denigrated, just as fallaciously, as being not worth reading. In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche's notebooks, in a topical arrangement that enables the reader to find what Nietzsche wrote on nihilism, art, morality, religion, the theory of knowledge, and whatever else interested him. But no previous edition—even in the original German—shows which notes Nietzsche utilized subsequently in his works, and which sections are not paralleled in the finished books. Nor has any previous edition furnished a commentary or index.Walter Kauffman, in collaboration with R.J. Hollingdale, brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche translator and scholar. Professor Kauffman has included the approximate date of each note. His running footnote commentary offers the information needed to follow Nietzsche's train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which notes were eventually superseded by later formulations, and where all German editions, including the very latest, depart from the manuscripts. The comprehensive index serves to guide the reader to the extraordinary riches of this book.",0394704371,9780394704371),Paperback,,575 pages,"

","A former postman and long-term alcoholic who did not become a full-time writer until middle age, Charles Bukowski was the author of autobiographical novels that captured the low life--including Post Office, Factotum, and Women--and made him a literary celebrity, with a major Hollywood film (Barfly) based on his life. Drawing on new interviews with virtually all of Bukowski's friends, family, and many lovers; unprecedented access to his private letters and unpublished writing; and commentary from Norman Mailer, Allen Ginsberg, Sean Penn, Mickey Rourke, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, R. Crumb, and Harry Dean Stanton, Howard Sounes has uncovered the extraordinary true story of the Dirty Old Man of American literature. Illustrated with drawings by Bukowski and over sixty photographs, Charles Bukowski is a must for Bukowski devotees and new readers alike. As the Los Angeles Times noted, ""Bukowski is one of those writers people remember more for the legend than for the work....but, as Howard Sounes shows in this exhaustively researched biography, it wasn't the whole story.""",0802136974,9780802136978),Paperback,,320 pages,"

As he’s already signed a contract that will ruin them if not fulfilled, Emily agrees to go with him to New York and help him set up their movie company. But of course, it’s not that easy—all movie production is controlled by Thomas Edison and his partners in the Patent Trust who hold many of the major patents used in filmmaking. And they employ a team of often brutal detectives whose main job it is to go around and disrupt independent films, breaking cameras and even heads if necessary. With a colorful crew of actors, Adam and Emily head to Fort Lee, New Jersey where they set shooting the films to fulfill their contract. After evading Edison’s detectives a couple of times, one of them arrives on the set in time for a major crowd scene. And, while almost everyone’s back is turned, he is murdered. Now Adam sits in jail, charged with the crime, while Emily has to not only finish films but uncover the truth about the shocking murder.",0312575203,9780312575205),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","The perfect gift for book lovers: a beautifully designed hardcover in which two of the world's great men have a delightfully rambling conversation about the future of the book in the digital era, and decide it is here to stay.These days it is almost impossible to get away from discussions of whether the book will survive the digital revolution. Blogs, tweets and newspaper articles appear daily on the subject, many of them repetitive, most of them admitting they don't know what will happen. Amidst the twittering, the thoughts of Jean-Claude Carrière and Umberto Eco come as a breath of fresh air. There are few people better placed to discuss the past, present and future of the book. Both of them avid book collectors with a deep understanding of history, they have explored through their work, both written and visual, the many and varied ways in which ideas have been represented through the ages.This beautifully produced book, an object of desire in itself, is the transcription of a long conversation between the two men in which they discuss a vast range of subjects, from what can be defined as the first book, to the idea of the library, the burning of books both accidental and deliberate, and what will happen to knowledge and memory when infinite amounts of information are available at the click of a mouse. En route there are delightful digressions into personal anecdote about everything from Eco's first computer to the book Carrière is most sad to have sold.Readers will close this book feeling that they have had the privilege of eavesdropping on an intimate discussion between two great minds. And while, as Carrière says, the one certain thing about the future is that it is unpredictable, it is clear from this conversation that, in some form or other, the book will survive. After all, as Eco says: like the spoon, once invented, it cannot be bettered.",1846554519,9781846554513),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Not every child who dies goes on to the afterlife. Some are caught halfway between life and death, in a sort of limbo known as Everlost: a shadow of the living world, filled with all the things and places that no longer exist. It's a magical, yet dangerous place where bands of lost kids run wild and anyone who stands in the same place too long sinks to the center of the Earth. Allie and Nick don't survive the car crash, and end up in Everlost, where coins are more valuable than anyone knows, fortune cookies tell the truth, monsters are real, and the queen of lost souls lives in a once-beloved tower. Nick and Allie have to learn to survive in a world with different rules, and figure out who they can trust - and who they must oppose at all costs. At stake is nothing less than the fate of Everlost and the living world they have left behind. In this gripping trilogy, Neal Shusterman explores questions of life, death, and what just might lie in between.",1442444274,9781442444270),ebook,,1264 pages,"

","An illegal immigrant is found murdered in an Edinburgh housing scheme: a racist attack, or something else entirely? Rebus is drawn into the case, but has other problems: his old police station has closed for business, and his masters would rather he retire than stick around. But Rebus is that most stubborn of creatures. As Rebus investigates, he must visit an asylum seekers' detention centre, deal with the sleazy Edinburgh underworld, and maybe even fall in love... Siobhan meanwhile has problems of her own. A teenager has disappeared from home and Siobhan is drawn into helping the family, which will mean travelling closer than is healthy towards the web of a convicted rapist. Then there's the small matter of the two skeletons - a woman and an infant - found buried beneath a concrete cellar floor in Fleshmarket Close. The scene begins to look like an elaborate stunt - but whose, and for what purpose? And how can it tie to the murder on the unforgiving housing-scheme known as Knoxland?",0752865633,9780752865638),Paperback,,482 pages,"

","Weasel fumbled the cloth aside. It was a shield, steel plate over dark wood, with rotting leather straps. It looked old, and battered, and real.  A former pickpocket, Weasel is the type of boy most people would avoid. Certainly, no one would ever trust him -- except for one man. Justice Holis took Weasel off the streets, gave him a home, a job as his clerk, and a key to his house. Weasel's new life may be a bit boring, but for the first time someone actually cares about him.  Now Justice Holis is the one in trouble. Arrested for treason, he will surely hang unless someone saves him -- and that someone can only be Weasel. But what can one boy do? Not much without help.  So with a mysterious girl named Arisa by his side, Weasel goes in search of the Falcon, the most dangerous bandit in Deorthas, but also the one person who would be able -- and possibly willing -- to stage a prison break.  But Weasel's fate changes when he stumbles upon a shield. Could this be the one said to have been lost for centuries, the one that bestows power on whoever holds it? If so, Weasel, once a lowly pickpocket, could be the most powerful person in the land.  With extraordinary craftsmanship, Hilari Bell weaves a fantasy adventure story that will have readers captivated from the first word to the last.",1442406720,9781442406728),ebook,,288 pages,"

","Kisah kasih sayang di antara Hilman Yong kacukan Korea – American – Cina dan Intan Zulaikha. Mereka sangat berbeza tetapi kerana perbezaan itulah mereka berjodoh. Malangnya, kesampaiankah jodoh mereka apabila Hilman Yong seorang yang baru mengenali Islam lebih mencintai Islam dari Intan Zulaikha yang sememangnya dilahirkan Islam dari keturunan lagi berselisih faham kerana ego seorang Intan.Muncul pula Damien Yong yang sentiasa menyesakkan dada Intan Zulaikha dengan aksinya yang daring, sexy, nakal dan menggoda. Intan terpaksa bersabar dengan Damien semata-mata untuk mendapatkan semula Hilmannya…seorang hamba Allah yang penuh kesabaran dan kesopanan.Hilmanku…sifuku…kekasihku…Kembalilah…” Saya tak pernah tinggalkan awak. Walaupun awak jauh, saya dapat melihat awak. Walaupun awak jauh, saya dapat merasa kehadiran awak. Walau pun awak jauh, saya dapat mendengar awak. Saya sentiasa di sisi awak. Awak sentiasa di sisi saya, di sini…” Hilman Yong” Don’t worry, I won’t kiss you. Saya tak cium sembarangan gadis. Saya tak ada selera dengan gadis biadab dan sombong seperti awak. Cik Zulaikha….saya nampak kehampaan di wajah awak. You really want me to kiss you. I can feel it. I can see it. From your eyes… your lips. Tetapi seperti saya cakap tadi, saya tak selera dengan orang biadab. Ciuman saya tidak semurah itu. Hanya untuk gadis yang bertuah dan terpilih saja.” Damien Yong” Saya akui saya gembira bersama Mr Damien..saya tak boleh menyembunyikan perasaan saya……tetapi perasaan saya terhadap Mr Damien sepertimana kita bersentuhan di malam itu. Boleh saling melihat, saling bersentuh, saling bercium…..tetapi hanya di dinding kaca….ada batas dan sekatan. Yang tidak boleh dipecahkan……walau cuba dipecahkan…pasti kita akan cedera..ditusuk atau dihiris . Itulah Islam. Yang menjaga maruah dan kesucian sesuatu hubungan. Hanya hubungan halal yang boleh melenyapkannya.” Intan Zulaikha",,,Mass Market Paperback,,1056 pages,"

","Betrayed by lies before her birth, Aishlinn believes kind and honorable men do not exist. Raised in near seclusion by a cruel stepfather, she is traded to work at Castle Firth in Penrith England for the price of two sheep. When the despised Earl of Penrith attacks her late one night and attempts to rape her, Aishlinn stabs him in self-defense and flees England for the safety of the Scottish highlands. Surviving the horrific beating at the hands of the Earl, Aishlinn is rescued by a fierce band of highland warriors who swear their allegiance to her for killing the hated Earl--the same man who had destroyed their village and killed their families when they were boys. Duncan McEwan, future chief of the Clan MacDougall, has survived countless battles and bed innumerable women. He has scaled mountains, survived a horrific storm at sea and even hand-to-claw battle with a ferocious cat-o'mountain. But none of that could have prepared him for how his life is forever changed one fateful spring day when he rescues a very battered young woman. Together with his men, they risk everything to take her to the safety of their clan. She soon learns that kind and honorable men do exist and one in particular changes her heart forever. She discovers an inner strength and it will be tested to the limits when she is forced to make a heart wrenching decision--allow the English to kill those she loves or surrender for the crime she committed. With an intense code of honor Duncan must now battle the feelings for the beautiful Aishlinn. He will do anything to keep her as his own and he'll do anything to keep her out of the hands of the English.",1468113054,9781468113051),Paperback,First Edition,240 pages,"

What do you do when you’re trapped between death and the devil? To protect her young daughter from a madman and a tyrant, Rachel Pryne must trust an enemy - one of the alien warriors who conquered Earth.
It is 2032, the Ohnenrai - Earth’s humanoid alien conquerors - orbit the planet, and Terran reproduction is failing. Rachel Pryne, a trained medic, is struggling to protect her seven-year-old daughter, Pearl, from the sexual predation of their penal colony’s leader. Having fathered the girl by rape, he now intends to take her on her eighth birthday, only six weeks away.
Then Rachel finds her unlikely champion - an injured Ohnenrai soldier who appears in her yard one stormy evening. She knows she may be choosing death over the devil in trusting this warrior, but she doesn’t know that her trust, and her DNA, will make her one of the most important and endangered people to ever set foot aboard an Ohnenrai starship.
***

Equal parts science fiction, suspense, and romance, Girl Under Glass moves from a post-apocalyptic wilderness in the American Pacific Northwest to a high-tech world aboard an alien starship furnished with all the stolen comforts of Earth. Readers meet Rachel Pryne, whose parents' lifelong and life-ending connection to the Ohnenrai has set her upon a path she never wanted to travel. And they're introduced to Ehtishem, an Ohnenrai soldier who exists to save his dying people, but who faces enemies from within and without his own military.


The only possible solution to the Ohnenrai’s extinction lies within Rachel, but all she wants to do is protect her daughter and see Earth’s alien conquerors go straight to hell.

Smelling, a brutal child killer has just gained his freedom after ten years of being locked away from society with one thing on his mind, vengeance! In response to a grievance with the two detectives who took away his freedom, as one of those detectives was Michael Redgrave. Without further warning the large black oil tanker that Smelling is driving starts ramming the Redgrave’s Fuji white range rover into the dark tunnel walls repeatedly, crushing it, until it becomes apparent upon further inspection that they are no living survivors. When the emergency services arrive with their specialised cutting equipment, they find that there’s only one survivor who’s in a critical condition. Against all odds Jonathon survives remembering very little of the accident, until his dead twin brother comes to his rescue in spiritual form as a ghost. Nathaniel vows to help and protect his brother from the ruthless killer who now wants to take Jonathon’s life and will go to any extreme to fulfil his mission.",1484089855,9781484089859),Paperback,,434 pages,"

Still reeling from these losses, she was raped by a friend she thought she could trust. She soon spiraled into a seemingly bottomless depression. One January night, the seventeen-year-old decided she no longer wanted to deal with the emotional pain that smothered her. She lay down on a set of cold railroad tracks and waited for a freight train to send her to heaven…and peace. But Kristen's story doesn’t end there.  In Life, In Spite of Me this remarkably joyful young woman shares the miracle of her survival, the agonizing aftermath of her failed suicide attempt, and the hope that has completely transformed her life, giving her a powerful purpose for living. Her gripping story of finding joy against all odds provides a vivid and unforgettable reminder that life is a gift to be treasured.   Includes notes of encouragement Kristen wishes she had received when she was struggling most.",1601422520,9781601422521),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Here is the kind of authentically detailed epic novel that has become Louis L’Amour’s hallmark. It is the compelling story of U.S. Air Force Major Joe Mack, a man born out of time. When his experimental aircraft is forced down in Russia and he escapes a Soviet prison camp, he must call upon the ancient skills of his Indian forebears to survive the vast Siberian wilderness. Only one route lies open to Mack: the path of his ancestors, overland to the Bering Strait and across the sea to America. But in pursuit is a legendary tracker, the Yakut native Alekhin, who knows every square foot of the icy frontier—and who knows that to trap his quarry he must think like a Sioux.",0553280422,9780553280425),Paperback,,371 pages,"

","An epic novel of genius and obsession — apocalyptic, lyrical and erotically charged. Spanning three centuries and two cultures, Hunger’s Brides brings to vivid life the greatest Spanish poet of her time, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, and plumbs a mystery that has intrigued writers as diverse as Robert Graves, Diane Ackerman, Eduardo Galeano and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Why did a writer of such gifts silence herself?At the time of her death in 1695, Juana Inés de la Cruz was arguably the greatest writer working in any European tongue, yet she had never set foot in Europe. Instead she was born among the descendants of the Aztec empire, in the shadow of the mountain pass Cortés and his troops descended on their advance to Montezuma’s capital. A child prodigy from a barbarous wilderness, her beauty and wit provoked a sensation at the viceregal court in Mexico City. But at the age of nineteen, still a favourite of the court, Juana entered a convent, and from that point her life unfolded between the mystery of her sudden flight from palace to cloister, and the enigma of her final vow of silence, signed in blood. After a quarter-century of graceful, often sensuous poetry, plays and theological argument, Sor Juana chose silence, which she maintained until she died of plague at the age of forty-five.Drawing on chronicles of the conquest and histories of the Inquisition, myth cycles and archeological studies, ancient poetry and early Spanish accounts of blood sacrifice, Hunger’s Brides is a mammoth work of inspired historical fiction framed in a contemporary mystery. In the dead of a Calgary winter night, a man escapes from an apartment in which a young woman lies bleeding — in his arms he clutches a box he has found on her table addressed to him. He is Donald Gregory, a once-respected, now-disgraced, academic. She is Beulah Limosneros, one of his students, and for a brief time his lover. Brilliant, erratic, voracious, she had disappeared two years earlier in Mexico, following the thread of her growing obsession with Sor Juana. Over the ensuing days and weeks, as a police investigation closes in around him, Gregory pieces together the contents of the box she has left him: a poetic journal of her travel in Mexico, diaries, research notes, unposted letters, and a strange manuscript — part biography, part novel — on Sor Juana.Hunger’s Brides is a dramatic unveiling of three intimate journeys: a man’s forced march to self-knowledge, a great poet’s withdrawal from the world, and a profane mystic’s pilgrimage into modern Mexico, in which the bones of the past constantly poke through a present built on the ruins of the vanquished.Excerpt from Hunger’s Brides“From the moment I was first illuminated by the light of reason, my inclination toward letters has been so vehement that not even the admonitions of others . . . nor my own meditations have been sufficient to cause me to forswear this natural impulse that God placed in me . . . that inclination exploded in me like gunpowder. . . .” —Sor Juana, in a letter of self-defence written to a bishop in 1691, just before she took a vow of silenceFrom the Hardcover edition.",0679312005,9780679312000),Paperback,,1376 pages,"

","In this long-awaited sequel to her bestselling books Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind, Natalie Goldberg, one of the most sought-after writing teachers of our time, takes us to the next step in the writing process.You’ve filled your notebooks, done your writing practice, discovered your original voice. Now what? How do you turn this raw material into finished stories, essays, poems, novels, memoirs? Drawing on her own experience as a writer and a student of Zen, Natalie shows you how to create a field big enough to allow your “wild mind” to wander — and then gently direct its tremendous energy into whatever you want to write.Here, too, is invaluable advice on how to overcome writer’s block, how to deal with the fear of criticism and rejection, how to get the most from working with an editor, and how to learn from reading accomplished authors. With humor and compassion, Goldberg recounts her own mistakes on the way to publication — and how you can avoid the most common pitfalls of the beginning writer. Through it all there is a deep celebration of writing itself — not just as the means to an end, but as a path to living a deeper, more fully alive life.",0553374966,9780553374964),Paperback,,240 pages,"

Far too young to be a widow, Angelina D'Angelo suddenly finds herself facing a life without her beloved husband, Frank. Late one night shortly after the funeral, she makes her way down to the kitchen and pours all of her grief and anger into the only outlet she has left-her passion for cooking. In a frenzy of concentration and swift precision, she builds layer upon layer of thick, rich lasagna, braids loaves of yeasty bread, roasts plump herb-rubbed chicken; she makes so much food that she winds up delivering the spoils to the neighbors in her tight-knit Italian community in South Philadelphia. Retiree Basil Cupertino, who has just moved in with his kindly sister across the street, is positively smitten with Angelina's food. In a stroke of good fortune, Basil offers Angelina (not only husbandless but unemployed) a job cooking for him-two meals a day, six days a week, in exchange for a handsome salary. Soon, word of her irresistible culinary prowess spreads and she finds herself cooking for seven bachelors-and in the process discovers the magical power of food to heal, to bring people together . . . and maybe even to provide a second chance at love. Filled to the brim with homemade warmth, Angelina's Bachelors is a sweet tale of overcoming grief, redefining family, and following your heart-through food.",145162056X,9781451620566),Paperback,,384 pages,"

Sophia has been in care ever since.Right away, Casey feels something isn’t right. Sophia’s a well-developed girl, who looks more like 18 than 12.

","Events in Rwanda in 1994 mark a landmark in the history of modern genocide. Up to one million people were killed in a planned public and political campaign. In the face of indisputable evidence, the Security Council of the United Nations failed to respond.  In this classic of investigative journalism, Linda Melvern tells the compelling story of what happened. She holds governments to account, showing how individuals could have prevented what was happening and didn't do so. The book also reveals the unrecognised heroism of those who stayed on during the genocide, volunteer peacekeepers and those who ran emergency medical care.  Fifteen years on, this new edition examines the ongoing impact of the 1948 Genocide Convention and the shock waves Rwanda caused around the world. Based on fresh interviews with key players and newly-released documents, A People Betrayed is a shocking indictment of the way Rwanda is and was forgotten and how today it is remembered in the West. ",184813245X,9781848132450),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Cystic Fibrosis: The Ultimate Teen Guide leaves no aspect of this disease untold. Based on a series of interviews with young people with CF and their family members, the day-to-day dealings of life as a cystic fibrosis patient are described. Some of the topics covered include a description of the illness; a comprehensive discussion of who gets the disease and why; an explanation of the procedures involved in diagnosing CF; coverage of the arduous daily therapies involved in maintaining the life of a person with CF; and the challenges of dealing with CF-related diabetes. These teens' stories reflect how they live their lives to the fullest, how they are not bitter about their situations, and how they look forward to new medications, more-effective therapies, and--one day soon--a cure. Also included are stories told by people, now in their 30s and 40s, having CF who are still alive and coping well with the disease, demonstrating that progress is being made and that they can hope to live beyond their teen years, something that wasn't likely 20 years ago. This book is the ideal guide for any reader who wants positive medical information about CF, offering an extensive glossary and listings of books, websites, and organizations about Cystic Fibrosis.",081084821X,9780810848214),Hardcover,,259 pages,"

","Facing the Music, Larry Brown’s first book, was originally published in 1988 to wide critical acclaim. As the St. Petersburg Times review pointed out, the central theme of these ten stories “is the ageless collision of man with woman, woman with man--with the frequent introduction of that other familiar couple, drinking and violence. Most often ugly, love is nevertheless graceful, however desperate the situation.”There’s some glare from the brutally bright light Larry Brown shines on his subjects. This is the work of a writer unafraid to gaze directly at characters challenged by crisis and pathology. But for readers who are willing to look, unblinkingly, along with the writer, there are unusual rewards.",1565121252,9781565121256),Paperback,,167 pages,"

","This book contains Edgar Allen Poe's 1838 short story, ""Ligeia"". An anonymous narrator recounts the story of his meeting a beautiful and intellectual woman ""in some large, old decaying city near the Rhine."" They get married, and Ligeia introduces her husband to all manner of mathematical and metaphysical knowledge. Soon after, she becomes seriously ill and dies. The narrator's second marriage comes to a similarly tragic end, resulting in the uncanny reappearance of the mysterious Ligeia. A gripping and atmospheric tale, ""Ligeia"" is highly recommended for fans of fantasy and horror fiction, and would make for a fantastic addition to any collection. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American author, editor, poet, and critic. Most famous for his stories of mystery and horror, he was one of the first American short story writers, and is widely considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre. Many antiquarian books such as this are becoming increasingly rare and expensive.

","With war threatening to spread from Europe to England, the sleepy village of Crowmarsh Priors settles into a new sort of normal: Evacuees from London are billeted in local homes. Nightly air raids become grimly mundane. The tightening vice of rationing curtails every comfort. Men leave to fight and die. And five women forge an unlikely bond of friendship that will change their lives forever. Alice Osbourne, the stolid daughter of the late vicar, is reeling from the news that Richard Fairfax broke their engagement to marry Evangeline Fontaine, an American girl from the Deep South. Evangeline's arrival causes a stir in the village, but not the chaos that would ensue if they knew her motives for being there. Scrappy Elsie Pigeon is among the poor of London who see the evacuations as a chance to escape a life of destitution. Another new arrival is Tanni Zayman, a young Jewish girl who fled the horrors of Europe and now waits with her newborn son, certain that the rest of her family is safe and bound to show up any day. And then there's Frances Falconleigh, a madcap, fearless debutante whose father is determined to keep her in the countryside and out of the papers. As the war and its relentless hardships intensify around them, the same struggles that threaten to rip apart their lives also bring the five closer together. They draw strength from one another to defeat formidable enemies - hunger, falling bombs, the looming threat of a Nazi invasion, and a traitor in their midst - and find remarkable strength within themselves to help their friends. Theirs is a war-forged loyalty that will outlast the fiercest battle and endure years and distance. When four of the women return to Crowmarsh Priors for a VE Day celebration fifty years later, television cameras focus on the heartwarming story of these old women as war brides of a bygone age, but miss the more newsworthy angle. The women's mission is not to commemorate or remember - they've returned to settle a score and avenge one of their own.",0141027126,9780141027128),Paperback,,467 pages,"

","All current and future gun control advocates should have these audiobooks in their library. These two audiobooks can be utilized as effective training tools for Second Amendment debate with pro-gun facets of society.Gun Control (2 Book Box Set)In “Gun Control and The Second Amendment Revised & Expanded” Byron Goines delivers irrefutable truth debunking the pro-gun facet myth of the Second Amendment being for individuals to have the right to bear arms in order to rise up against a tyrannical government. This second edition is packed with information laid out in a straightforward format that will unequivocally prove the truth about the Second Amendment and lay to rest once and for all the false Second Amendment claims made by pro-gun facets of society.In “The Insurrectionist Mindset of Pro-Gun Facets of Society,” Byron Goines explains the insurrectionist interpretation of the Second Amendment that has been utilized for years by pro-gun facets of society to deceive Americans. The Constitution of the United States of America is clearly against insurrections yet pro-gun facets of society continue to deceive Americans by stating the Second Amendment gives them the right to bear arms in order to rise up against a tyrannical government which is clearly an insurrection. Bearing arms against the United States government is an insurrection and rebellion against the United States and the Constitution specifically addresses insurrections in detail and is totally against insurrections throughout.",,,Audiobook,,34 pages,"

","In this feverishly beautiful novel— subsequently titled If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem and now published in the authoritative Library of America text—William Faulkner interweaves two narratives, each wholly absorbing in its own right, each subtly illuminating the other. In New Orleans in 1937, a man and a woman embark on a headlong flight into the wilderness of illicit passion, fleeing her husband and the temptations of respectability. In Mississippi ten years earlier, a convict sets forth across a flooded river, risking his own chance at freedom to rescue a pregnant woman. From these separate stories Faulkner composes a symphony of deliverance and damnation, survival and self-sacrifice, a novel in which elemental danger is juxtaposed wiht fatal injuries of the spirit. The Wild Palms is grandly inventive, heart-stopping in its prose, and suffused on every page with the physical presence of the country that Faulkner made his own.",0679741933,9780679741930),Paperback,,304 pages,"

PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE EDGY.' A young inquisitive girl hitches a lift with an older charismatic Bohemian man. Neither has a final destination in mind, and so they find themselves drifting aimlessly through middle America; driving, smoking, sharing confidences, looking out for each other, and stopping as and when the mood takes them. Their relationship is pure, simple -- and when they do finally have sex, it's she who makes the first move. But this is a strange, stolen time that must come to an end: the girl will grow up; the man's past will catch up with him; and the world outside will not accept their relationship. With shades of ""Lolita"" and ""Morvern Callar,"" ""The Ice Age"" is a remarkable first novel, with an exceptional voice that's both seductive and compelling, and which readers will quite simply fall in love with.",1447200411,9781447200413),Paperback,,,"

","An ostentatiously presented tome dedicated to the worst comic strip ever denotes the end of publishing and the climax of human achievement.With its embossed, gold foil-stamped cover, top-quality glossy paper, and impeccable attention to detail, it’s clear that no expense was spared in making Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff. It feels good in your hands: a true work of art, a collector’s dream.But then you notice something wrong. There’s a stain on the cover. And it is there on purpose. It’s a coffee ring printed onto the cover with gloss laminate.This book, the debut effort by cult cartoonist Dave Strider, was realized with the help of a dedicated team of experienced artists. KC Green (gunshowcomic.com), John Keogh (lucid-tv.com), and David Malki ! (wondermark.com) served as designers. Homestuck creator Andrew Hussie (mspaintadventures.com) served as consultant.Since the days of Gutenberg, publishers have tried to marry form with content in pleasing and impressive ways. And while there have been fancy books, and there have been bad books, never before in the history of the codex have the two been mismatched in so dramatic and pointless a fashion. Like a wrench torquing a bolt too hard and shearing off its head, so too does Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff completely and irrevocably break the notion of the printed book.The online comic strip “Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff” follows a handful of friends who get up to nonsensical hijinks. This is in the rare cases when it makes any sense at all. It is universally acknowledged as the worst comic strip ever created.The book Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff lavishly presents the comic’s entire run in a treatment worthy of the highest masters of the form. It contains a completely gratuitous 4-page centerfold reading simply “centaurfold” in bright pink type.Scattered throughout the book are perforated business-reply cards taking the form of irredeemable Subway coupons (a first for comic strip collections). Each copy of the book also comes with a “travel version” (a removable poster of all the book’s pages in grid format); a custom commemorative coin (randomly chosen from 4 designs struck); an oversized plastic paperclip imprinted with the word “paperclop”; and an animated lenticular bookmark. Bound into the spine is a red ribbon approximately three feet long, and if you scratch the nacho chip sticker on the back cover, it smells faintly of pizza. (The hologram sticker of Tony Hawk smells only of chemicals.)",1936561034,9781936561032),Hardcover,Limited Edition,184 pages,"

In one morning, he gets two.DNA from a 1989 rape and murder matches a 29-year-old convicted rapist. Was he an eight-year-old killer or has something gone terribly wrong in the new Regional Crime Lab? The latter possibility could compromise all of the lab's DNA cases currently in court.Then Bosch and his partner are called to a death scene fraught with internal politics. Councilman Irvin Irving's son jumped or was pushed from a window at the Chateau Marmont. Irving, Bosch's longtime nemesis, has demanded that Harry handle the investigation.Relentlessly pursuing both cases, Bosch makes two chilling discoveries: a killer operating unknown in the city for as many as three decades, and a political conspiracy that goes back into the dark history of the police department.",0316069418,9780316069410),Hardcover,,388 pages,"

","AcknowledgmentsHollywood is a town of fabulators. The people who dwell there create fictions for a living, fictions that refuse tidily to confine themselves to the screen, but spill over into the daily lives of the men and women who regard themselves as stars in the movies of their own lives. Although this book tells readers altogether more than they may wish to know about the Hollywood of the '70s, I do not flatter myself that I have arrived at ""the truth."" At the end of this long, twisted road I am once again struck with the force of the old maxim, the more you know, the more you know what you don't know. This is particularly true in the case of Hollywood, where despite the reams of memos and contracts that now gather dust on the shelves of university libraries, very little of what really matters is committed to paper, so that an endeavor of this sort is dependent on memory -- in this case of an era twenty or thirty years in the past. Not only is the terrain distant, but in this period memory has been enfeebled by booze and drugs.In a town where credit grabbing is an art form, to say that memory is self-serving is to say that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Moreover, defect of memory is a shield that enables people to go to work in the morning, protecting them from the unspeakable behavior that is taken for granted there. As director Paul Schrader puts it, ""In this business, you've got to have a selective memory. Otherwise, it's too painful."" Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" remains one of the truest movies about the movies and the people who make them.In this maze of mirrors, lucky is the chronicler who does not lose his or her way in the infini, Alice Mayhew gave ither blessing, and Bob Bender, along with his assistant, Johanna Li, helped it to see the light of day. My agent, Kris Dahl, guided me through the shoals of writing and editing.Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Elizabeth Hess, and daughter, Kate, for their unfailing patience and support.Copyright © 1998 by Peter Biskind",0747544212,9780747544210),Paperback,,506 pages,"

","Ford McKinney leads a charmed life: he's a young doctor possessing good looks, good breeding, and money. He comes from an old Savannah family where his parents, attentive to his future, focus their energies on finding their son--their golden boy--a girl to marry. But how charmed is this life when Ford's own heart suspects that he is not meant to spend his life with a woman? His suspicions are confirmed when he meets Dan Crell. Dan is a quiet man with a great voice. Behind the tempered facade of the shy hospital administrator is a singer who can transform a room with his soaring voice, leaving his listeners in awe and reverence. Ford catches one such Christmas concert and his life is never quite the same; he is touched in a place he keeps hidden, forbidden. When Ford and Dan begin to explore the limits of their relationship, Dan's own secrets are exposed--and his mysterious and painful childhood returns to haunt him. In Comfort and Joy Jim Grimsley finds a marriage between the stark and stunning pain of his prize-winning Winter Birds and the passion of critically acclaimed Dream Boy. In this, his fourth novel, he considers pressing questions. How does a man reconcile the child he was raised to be with the man that he truly is? What happens when an adult has to choose between his parents and a lover?",1565123964,9781565123960),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Starred Review. Dolan gets everything right in his debut, a suspense novel that breathes new life into familiar themes. The enigmatic David Loogan, who's recently moved to Ann Arbor, Mich., has stumbled into an editing job for Gray Streets, a mystery magazine, after anonymously submitting a short story. One night, Loogan's boss, Tom Kristoll, asks him for help in disposing of a corpse. Loogan goes to Kristoll's house and does so, despite his suspicions that Kristoll's account of how the man ended up dead is incomplete at best. When Kristoll later dies in a fall from his office window, the police mark Loogan, who's been having an affair with Kristoll's wife, as a person of interest. Pitch-perfect prose and sophisticated characterizations drive the noirish plot, which offers plenty of unexpected twists. Fans of Peter Abrahams and Scott Turow will find a lot to like. While the solution may strike some as a tad improbable, the talent Dolan displays suggests he has a bright future. (July) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Its alarms stay silent; its sprinkler system remains inactive. Nearby NUMA special projects director Dirk Pitt notices smoke and races to the rescue. He's too late to save the engineer behind the ship's new technology, but helps the man's daughter, Kelly Egan, escape with her father's work in a leather briefcase.While Ms. Egan strives to uncover the hidden value in her father's inventions, Pitt is hired on by maritime insurers to investigate the wreckage. Neither are prepared for the mechanical marvels they'll soon be forced to confront.

And they may be Pitt and Egan's only hope when an oil tycoon with a plan of his own appears on the scene.Before journey's end, Pitt will take on a power-mad millionaire, tread upon territory previously known only to Verne's illustrious Captain Nemo, and make shocking discoveries about his own past.",0425204049,9780425204047),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","What is it like for a native people of the rainforest to confront features of a modern world? In 1980-82, the Gebusi of Papua New Guinea held elaborate ritual dances and spirit seances, practiced alternative sexual customs, and endured a very high rate of violence. By 1998, however, most Gebusi had been willingly transformed by Christian conversion, schooling, market activity, disco music, sports leagues, and local government. This book vividly portrays both the traditions and the dramatic changes of Gebusi society and culture. Written especially for students, the account uses personal stories and ethnographic examples to connect developments among Gebusi to topics that are widely considered in anthropology courses, including comparative features of subsistence, kinship, economics, politics, religion, gender, ethnicity, and nationalism. The author lived among the Gebusi for several years, on two occasions. His account of his experience with these fascinating people aims to illustrate issues and topics prominent in undergraduate anthropology courses; provide a dramatic, personal, and well-written story of cultural transformation; and unfold the relation between so-called traditional customs and so-called modern ones. His goal in publishing the ethnography is ""to let the Gebusi come alive to readers, to portray their past and their present, and to connect their dramatic changes with those in my own life and those in contemporary anthropology.""",,,Kindle Edition,,208 pages,"

The Commander of the Armies of Light decides to turn an Elven mine into a refuge for those driven from their homes by the war. Kellen is put in command of the force of engineers and warriors who will fortify the mine and does not learn until it is nearly too late that the caverns are full of Shadowed Elves. Vestakia, the half-human, half-Demon healer, finds that she has begun to be able to read the mind of her Demon father, Crown Prince Zyperis. The Demon Queen, Savilla, is preparing a great sacrifice that will summon He Who Is back to the world and make her the ultimate ruler forever. When Wild Mage Idalia learns of Savilla's plans, she knows there is only one way to prevent the coming of He Who Is. A very different sort of sacrifice must be made.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",1429913037,9781429913034),ebook,,496 pages,"

","Some say fate holds the cards. But what if love deals the hand? No love goes untested. Ever. Indeed, true love is left to prove itself. And that is exactly where fate steps in to play the game.For William and Sarah, that game begins with growing up, in the unspoiled mountains of Colorado. In a time and space as clear as the Rocky Mountain skies above, these young souls together learn about life, what matters most, what endures, what doesn’t, and about love. Innocent young love moves ever so surely toward lives they both can picture, lives spent loving each other in a place they know so well and cherish.Will and Sarah are ecstatically swept away in the swells of new love. And it is in their rarefied bliss that they make the fragile promise of first love, a promise that fate will soon rock and pound into doubt, guilt, and epiphany.Unexpected and unprepared, these young lovers are suddenly torn apart, first by distance, and then by the far greater pressures of temptation that test the very fidelity of their heart-held promise. No longer able to console each other, hold each other, touch each other, they face the inevitable decision: move on to other loves, or cling to the faith that they will someday be together, again.Will and Sarah stare down an unknown path, sensing destiny will not wait long before it comes to take them. Wracked with doubt, they wonder if their love was real. Caged by guilt, they both feel tempted by others intent on stealing their hearts.Fate plays hardest when love is tested. And Will and Sarah are no exception, letting go of their happy past to embrace hope for an uncharted future. Love plays hardest when fate tests. And so it is, even through their trials of the heart, Will and Sarah never really stop loving each other. Theirs is a love so real and pure that each just wants the other to find happiness, even if it's with another. But fate does not surrender so easily. Dealing blow upon blow, both Will and Sarah are each struck by jolting events that take them to the very edge of life, itself. What happens to love when life is on the line? Can they both relinquish control when love is on the line? Will fate even allow them to find out?",,,ebook,,290 pages,"

However, trouble seemed to follow him where he went. Now, after having angered every terrorist on Earth and at least five governments, buying a farm in a third world country was looking pretty good. Of course, nothing was ever simple. With Chechen terrorists knocking on the door and tenant farmers with a truly Byzantine culture, the question was whether he could drag the keldara into the 21st century before the Chechen put them back in the 6th. Kildar answers the question: Where would an international security specialist and former SEAL choose to retire—if he's going to buy the farm, it should be one with beautiful women and the best beer in the world.

","Undoing the familiar notion of the Middle Ages as a period of religious persecution and intellectual stagnation, María Menocal now brings us a portrait of a medieval culture where literature, science, and tolerance flourished for 500 years.The story begins as a young prince in exile—the last heir to an Islamic dynasty—founds a new kingdom on the Iberian peninsula: al-Andalus. Combining the best of what Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures had to offer, al-Andalus and its successors influenced the rest of Europe in dramatic ways, from the death of liturgical Latin and the spread of secular poetry, to remarkable feats in architecture, science, and technology. The glory of the Andalusian kingdoms endured until the Renaissance, when Christian monarchs forcibly converted, executed, or expelled non-Catholics from Spain. In this wonderful book, we can finally explore the lost history whose legacy is still with us in countless ways. Author Biography: María Rosa Menocal is R. Selden Rose Professor of Spanish and Portuguese and head of the Whitney Humanities Center at Yale University. She lives in New Haven, CT.",0316168718,9780316168717),Paperback,,352 pages,"

Though secretly holding out for a love that would consume her, she acquiesces her fate to wed this knight, a man she loves no more than she could a brother. But a chance meeting with a devastatingly handsome merchant shakes the very foundation of her world, compelling her to act and think in ways she never thought possible.LOVE CAME BACK TO HAUNT HER…ERYN REXFORD, a modern-day photographer, has everything many women dream of: Beauty, wealth, a sexy and successful husband, a career she loves, and a beautiful house nestled in a community of beach homes. But passionate love, the one thing she longs for, she learns to live without, until recurring dreams and visions spark memories of a life lived long ago and of a man whose love promises to follow her through time. Eryn recognizes a whisper of that promise in the eyes of a handsome stranger who stays close enough for her to notice, but not close enough for her to remember.LOVE HAS NO BOUNDARIES…Two women, born centuries apart, both accept lives of obligation and responsibility; lives without passion, with men who would claim them for their own. Until, that is, a chain of events complicates things in ways they never imagined, all because of one man’s love for a woman…a love that crosses through centuries to find her again.",,,Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Darina is in denial. Even after all she’s been through, the Beautiful Dead can’t be real. They must be a figment of her grief-stricken imagination. But visions of Phoenix and Hunter prove otherwise and soon she’s drawn back to Foxton, to the barn, to Phoenix - where they have, what may just be, their final reunion. It’s the moment they’ve been dreading - time to solve Phoenix’s mystery. Everything has been building to this but Darina knows that revealing the true circumstances of Phoenix’s death will lead to their final parting. With this impossible mixture of emotions, Darina begins to unscramble the facts, but she’s up against mounting obstacles: the distraction of Hunter’s personal mystery, Phoenix’s returning father, threats of gang violence and conspiracies to blur and block the truth. With time pressure mounting and the risk of Phoenix being sent back into unending limbo, Darina puts herself in danger, and so the mystery of the Beautiful Dead builds into a heart-breaking climax ...",0340988649,9780340988640),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","The eagerly anticipated novel from the bestselling author of A Student of Weather and Garbo Laughs. Harry Boyd, a hard-bitten refugee from failure in Toronto television, has returned to a small radio station in the Canadian North. There, in Yellowknife, in the summer of 1975, he falls in love with a voice on air, though the real woman, Dido Paris, is both a surprise and even more than he imagined. Dido and Harry are part of the cast of eccentric, utterly loveable characters, all transplants from elsewhere, who form an unlikely group at the station. Their loves and longings, their rivalries and entanglements, the stories of their pasts and what brought each of them to the North, form the centre. One summer, on a canoe trip four of them make into the Arctic wilderness (following in the steps of the legendary Englishman John Hornby, who, along with his small party, starved to death in the barrens in 1927), they find the balance of love shifting, much as the balance of power in the North is being changed by the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline, which threatens to displace Native people from their land.Elizabeth Hay has been compared to Annie Proulx, Alice Hoffman, and Isabel Allende, yet she is uniquely herself. With unforgettable characters, vividly evoked settings, in this new novel, Hay brings to bear her skewering intelligence into the frailties of the human heart and her ability to tell a spellbinding story. Written in gorgeous prose, laced with dark humour, Late Nights on Air is Hay’s most seductive and accomplished novel yet.",0771038119,9780771038112),Hardcover,,364 pages,"

","WARNING: This book does NOT end in a cliffhanger. It is NOT too short (450 pages). It has a Happily Ever After ending. No secret billionaires or naked rock stars.And no one kisses a chicken. Pinky promise.From USA Today Bestselling Author Julia Kent:Hot make-out session? Check. With the dreamy obstetrician? Check. While her best friend is in labor? Um...It's Complicated.Josie Mendham never meant to have her own (radically different) set of gasps and moans a few doors down from where her best friend, Laura, was giving birth. And stealing away with the obstetrician who was consulting on Laura's case certainly wasn't part of any birth plan.When Dr. Alex Derjian watched the foursome enter the labor ward he did a doubletake: two dads? That defied biology as he knew it. Even more intriguing was the woman with the birthing mother and the fathers: Josie, the nurse he'd been watching from afar for months. One elevator kiss led to an on-call room soiree and soon he was breaking every romantic rule in his playbook.Finding his way into her pants wouldn't be hard.But into her heart? That would be a challenge.It's Complicated is the much-awaited novel that combines the stories of Laura, Mike, Dylan, Josie, and Madge from the Her Two Billionaires series with Darla, Trevor and Joe from the USA Today Bestseller Random Acts of Crazy, with Alex and Josie at the center of it all.Romantic Comedy meets New Adult romance in this 130,000 word/450 page novel that asks whether people can get out of their own way and learn that love isn't easy...but it's always worth it.",,,Kindle Edition,,411 pages,"

","As we weather the choppy waters we call Life, it’s a decision we will face time and time and time again: Do we cling to a situation that’s taking us under out of fear of letting go of the familiar…or do we open our hand and let go of that friendship, that relationship, that job, that opportunity, or that grievance that we’ve been clinging to, realizing that to flail around uncertainly for a season is all a part of discovering our destiny?“How do you know so much about letting go and moving on?” You might ask. “What makes you the expert?”Well, I’m not an expert. Let’s get that straight. I’m not a guru. I’m not a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a counselor or a fortune teller or the Great and Powerful Oz.I am a single woman. Just like you.Maybe you’re not a single woman – or even a woman. Maybe you’re just someone who needs to release someone or something that’s holding you back from being your best self and living your best life. And that’s okay, too. As I say on my Twitter page and on my website on a regular basis, anyone looking for inspiration and motivation is welcome here. Anyone looking to leave the past behind and shine is welcome here. And anyone who holds out for the best and refuses to settle for less is welcome here. Married, single, female, male, old, young, gay, straight. Come one, come all!Just like you - I am a friend. A sister. A daughter. An aunt.I have loved and lost. I have grieved and clung. I have let go and moved on.Sneakers or stilettos, I’ve been in your shoes…and I know every step of the journey. Perhaps even better than any guru or expert or counselor or fortune teller.I am the best friend who will tell you what you NEED to hear and not what you WANT to hear. I am the big sister with the shoulder to cry on when it seems like the rest of the world has turned away. I hope to be the Cruise Director who guides you full steam ahead through the often choppy and turbulent waters of letting go and moving on directly to the white sandy beach of life AFTER letting go and moving on. Do you see me? I’m waiting for you there, fruity drink with the little umbrella in hand.So what does this actually look like, this “letting go and moving on” thing? What are the steps? What does it mean? And how do you know when it’s time to throw in the towel…call it a day…and walk away? In “The Single Woman’s Sassy Survival Guide to Letting Go & Moving On,” we’ll cover the five major areas of life that we often find ourselves needing to let go of: Relationships, Friendships, Jobs, Opportunities, and Grievances. How are we going to do it? By examining the five benchmarks for letting go and moving on: the Who, the What, the Why, the When, and the How. At the end of each chapter, we’ll review the Five Fabulous Finds from that section for you to take away as daily affirmations, pick-me-ups, or sassy reminders to get you off of “What Might Have Been” Highway and back on the road to letting go and moving on.So sit down with your computer, your iPhone, your iPad, or whatever other technological device you happen to be reading from and let’s have some good old-fashioned girl talk. Kick off your shoes, grab a glass of wine…and let’s turn the page and leave the past behind.Shall we?",,,Kindle Edition,,72 pages,"

","""Picture a ballerina in a tutu and toe shoes. What does she look like?"" As the only African American soloist dancing with the prestigious American Ballet Theatre, Misty Copeland has made history. But when she first placed her hands on the barre at an after-school community center, no one expected the undersized, anxious thirteen-year-old to become a ground-breaking ballerina. When she discovered ballet, Misty was living in a shabby motel room, struggling with her five siblings for a place to sleep on the floor. A true prodigy, she was dancing en pointe within three months of taking her first dance class and performing professionally in just over a year: a feat unheard of for any classical dancer. But when Misty became caught between the control and comfort she found in the world of ballet and the harsh realities of her own life (culminating in a highly publicized custody battle), she had to choose to embrace both her identity and her dreams, and find the courage to be one of a kind. With an insider's unique point of view, Misty opens a window into the life of a professional ballerina who lives life center stage: from behind the scenes at her first auditions to her triumphant roles in some of the most iconic ballets. But in this beautifully written memoir, she also delves deeper to reveal the desire and drive that made her dreams reality. Life in Motion is a story of passion and grace for anyone who has dared to dream of a different life.",1476737983,9781476737980),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

If the fear of death is “the most rational thing in the world,” how does one contend with it? An atheist at twenty and an agnostic at sixty, Barnes looks into the various arguments for, against, and with God, and at his own bloodline, which has become, following his parents’ death, another realm of mystery.Deadly serious, masterfully playful, and surprisingly hilarious,

","The Magic Behind the Voices is a fascinating package of biographies, anecdotes, credit listings, and photographs of the actors who have created the unmistakable voices for some of the most popular and enduring animated characters of all time.Drawn from dozens of personal interviews, the book features a unique look at thirty-nine of the hidden artists of show business. Often as amusing as the characters they portray, voice actors are charming, resilient people-many from humble beginnings-who have led colorful lives in pursuit of success. Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill's Mike Judge was an engineer for a weapons contractor turned self-taught animator and voice actor. Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson) was a small town Ohio girl who became the star prot'g' of Daws Butler-most famous for Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and Quick Draw McGraw. Mickey Mouse (Wayne Allwine) and Minnie Mouse (Russi Taylor) are a real-life husband-and-wife team. Spanning many studios and production companies, this book captures the spirit of fun that bubbles from those who create the voices of favorite animated characters.In the earliest days of cartoons, voice actors were seldom credited for their work. A little more than a decade ago, even the Screen Actors Guild did not consider voice actors to be real actors, and the only voice actor known to the general public was Mel Blanc. Now, Oscar-winning celebrities clamor to guest star on animated television shows and features.Despite the crushing turnouts at signings for shows such as Animaniacs, The Simpsons, and SpongeBob Squarepants, most voice actors continue to work in relative anonymity. The Magic Behind the Voices features personal interviews and concise biographical details, parting the curtain to reveal creators of many of the most beloved cartoon voices.",1578066964,9781578066964),Paperback,,367 pages,"

","One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century addresses the conflicts that arise between people with opposing views and the dangers of losing your individual identity in your desire to belong to a group with shared values.In Belief, Doubt, and Fanaticism: Is It Essential to Have Something to Believe In?, Osho brings his unique and often surprising perspective to the religious, political, social and economic forces that drive people into opposing camps, fanatical groups, and belief systems that depend on seeing every ""other"" as the ""enemy."" As always, the focus is first and foremost on the individual psyche and consciousness, to identify the root causes and hidden demons of our human need to belong and have something to ""believe in.""Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.",0312595484,9780312595487),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","A beautifully rendered, keenly detailed, and sexually frank novel about motherhood and marriage, love and infidelitySpanning three generations in the life of a Norwegian family, Before You Sleep sparkles with wisdom, acuity, and style and carries with it the excitement of a genuine literary discovery. As the novel moves from present-day Oslo to 1930's Brooklyn, Ullmann tells her story through the voices of the eccentric and formidable women of the Blom family whose passions and prejudices have formed an intricate web that bonds grandmother to mother, and mother to child. Hailed by European critics as ""a real masterpiece,"" and ""playful and melancholy, entertaining and disquieting,"" Before You Sleep unflinchingly explores the emotional terrain of marriage and motherhood, which Karin, the novel's young, complicated narrator, characterizes as ""an endless stream of broken promises."" Karin's wry, witty, and candid perspective suffuses the novel and it is she who introduces us to the others: her sister Julie, a wife and mother nearly destroyed by her husband's infidelity; their mother Anni, the irresistible seductress, and Aunt Selma, who drinks to stay mean and who fries girls' ears for breakfast. Linn Ullmann's marvelously accomplished and assured debut, already an international sensation, unfolds with the sweep and color of a symphony and heralds the arrival of a mature and gifted literary talent.",067088698X,9780670886982),Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","The Kabbalistic Murder Code is an original and innovative Israeli thriller that was written for all those having an interest in Kabbalah. It incorporates two seemingly unconnected elements: a string of strange murders and the deciphering of ancient Kabbalistic texts, along with their hidden and mystical meanings.A professor from Jerusalem, an expert in decoding ancient Hebrew manuscripts, is hired to carry out a mysterious task, one that sends him to three continents. He becomes entangled in a web of murders that leave him deeply puzzled. However, he quickly discovers that if he does not succeed in deciphering the enigmatic manuscripts, through his in-depth knowledge of Kabbalah, the lives of many people - including his own family - will be endangered.Interwoven within this exciting tale are curious passages reviewing the many conquests that the city of Jerusalem has endured during its long history. Their relevance and significance become clear only at the end of the book.The Kabbalistic Murder Code is an exciting and fast-paced thriller. Thanks to its unique structure and enriching subject matter (the secret wisdom of Kabbalah), you simply cannot put it down. The drama's surprising solution integrates Kabbalistic elements and weaves the whole to a magical picture, leaving the reader almost breathless. It has been translated to date into four languages.Scroll up and grab a copy today.",,,,,,,"['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Thriller', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Crime', 'Fiction']"

With courage and caution, Pete slowly earns a measure of trust from this paranoid survivalist itching for a final conflict that will signal the coming End Times.But as Pete's own family spins out of control, Benjamin's activities spark the full-blown interest of the F.B.I., putting Pete at the center of a massive manhunt from which no one will emerge unscathed.",0062286447,9780062286444),Hardcover,,466 pages,"

","""Need a lift?""The man was gorgeous, sitting astride his Harley Davidson, mysteriously parked on a moonlit strip of sand. At thirty-seven, Christine Moore had a world-class case of burnout: career blues, no husband, no children, an imperfect figure, and dimming expectations. ""I'm going to show you a peace so beautiful, you'll probably forget what your life has been like up until now,"" he said. Who was this guy? ""My friends call me Joe. Others call me 'God' or 'Higher Power.' You can call me whatever you're most comfortable with."" Right. But he knows everything about her, every one of her heart's desires. A sweet serenity settles over Christine. And so the journey begins, a triumphant odyssey of self-discovery that illuminates our souls. As we join one woman's inspiring quest for healing and life-changing truths, we discover six powerful precepts that offer the deepest peace and fulfillment we can ever know. Every woman longing to experience the joy of loving and of respecting her true self will find comfort, guidance and hope in the simple, profound secrets to an enlightened and enriched new life that Christine learns. In the life-affirming tradition of The Celestine Prophecy, God on a Harley lights the way to a much-needed spiritual home. ",0671002783,9780671002787),Mass Market Paperback,,147 pages,"

After returning to the Diotech compound and undergoing an experimental new memory alteration, Seraphina is now a loyal, obedient servant to Dr. Alixter and the powerful company that created her. Happy and in love with Kaelen, another scientifically-enhanced human designed to be her perfect match, Sera’s history with a boy named Zen is just a distant memory from a rebellious past she longs to forget.But as Sera and Kaelen embark on a nationwide tour to promote Diotech’s new product line—a collection of controversial genetic modifications available to the public—Sera’s mind starts to rebel. She can’t stop the memories of Zen from creeping back in. As more secrets are revealed, more enemies are uncovered, and the reality of a Diotech-controlled world grows closer every day, Sera will have to choose where her true loyalties lie, but it’s a choice that may cost her everything she’s ever loved.",,,Kindle Edition,,432 pages,"

Foreigners seemed less welcome, and an inordinate amount of war material was on the move, scarcely camouflaged now. Still, people seemed clean and tidy and prosperous. ""You should know what's wrong after typing all my articles,"" Uncle Dick had replied. ""Don't imagine Hitler a benefactor to the German people."" Neither of them could know that within a few weeks Ann would be living with total strangers, in a house with a secret which was to involve her in a dangerous and desperate venture. Events were to teach her in no uncertain terms just what the Nazi regime meant to ordinary decent people, and that things could be wrong beyond all imagination.

","Maurizio Maggiani ha una predilezione per l’oralità, gli piace sentire e far sentire come il racconto nasca dalla voce, dall’ascolto, dal rapporto che si crea tra la logica dei fatti e l’eco profonda della parola che li restituisce. È questo un segno decisivo dei suoi romanzi e degli incontri con il pubblico dei lettori. Ebbene, qui Maggiani fa un passo avanti e imbocca con rabbia e ardore la via dell’invettiva – un’oralità che sale di volume e di passione oratoria, perché, senza meno, deve ottenere un risultato: andare a segno. L’attenzione si sposta dalla leggenda delle cose accadute allo scacco delle promesse non mantenute. Le promesse fatte dalla sua generazione. Non poteva ben considerarsi beata la gioventù di un dopoguerra che si apriva provvido di speranze, di ideali, di futuro, e di un’alimentazione equilibrata? E allora? Che cosa succede ai figli del privilegio? Che cosa dissipano mentre disegnano un mondo nuovo? Oltre il confine della battaglia combattuta si apre il cedere del sogno, la traduzione dei ribelli in mediocri esecutori, manager, reggicoda di molti poteri. Maggiani amministra colpi con generosità – li chiama maledizioni. E tali sono, maledizioni. Perché i destinatari dell’invettiva e quelli che, pur fuori dal tiro generazionale, si riconoscono, sappiano almeno fare i conti con la vergogna del fallimento.",8807030934,9788807030932),Paperback,I narratori,64 pages,"

","The first meeting between Slater Rawlings and Liberty Drake could hardly be called ideal. As acting deputy of Shotgun, Texas, Liberty is simply enforcing the town laws. But Slater, a former Texas Ranger with a restless spirit, is surprised to find himself on the wrong side of the law - and even more shocked to realise it's a she who is arresting him!Yet despite his rocky start in Shotgun, Slater find himself drawn to the close-knit town, to its strong church family, and especially to the fascinating Deputy Drake.

But with her dad leaving the country for work, it turns out she doesn't have a choice: Shelby has to move back into her mamma's house, deep in the heart of the Louisiana bayou.

Never have we been more in need of information and perspective, for if we wish to avoid war we must understand it. Michael Howard offers an analysis of our present predicament by discussing those issues that cause war and make peace. His book includes an examination of nuclear strategy today, views of the past about the conduct of international relations, ethics, modes of defense, and studies of military thinkers and leaders.

Knowing that Sarai cannot become what she wants to be overnight, Victor begins to train her and inevitably their complicated relationship heats up. As Arthur Hamburg’s right-hand man, Willem Stephens, closes in on his crusade to destroy Sarai, she is left with the crushing realization that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. But Sarai, taking on the new and improved role of Izabel Seyfried, still has a set of deadly skills of her own that will prove to be all she needs to secure her place beside Victor.But there is one test that Izabel must face that has the potential to destroy everything she is working so hard to achieve.

","What would happen if you were to allow everything to be exactly as it is? If you gave up the need for control, and instead embraced the whole of your experience in each moment that arose? In the 14 years that he studied Zen, Adyashanti found that most seasoned meditators had used the practice as ""an end instead of a means to an end."" What he ultimately realized was that only when you let go of all techniques—even the concept of yourself as a meditator—will you open to the art of True Meditation, dwelling in the natural state. True Meditation invites you to join the growing number of seekers who have been touched by the wisdom of Adyashanti to learn:How to make the ""effortless effort"" that will vivify the present moment• Meditative self-inquiry and ""The Way of Subtraction"": how to ask a spiritually powerful question—and determine the real answer• Two guided meditations on CD intended to reveal what Adyashanti calls ""your home as awareness itself""""We've been taught that awakening is difficult,"" explains Adyashanti, ""that to wake up from the illusion of separation takes years. But all it really takes is a willingness to look into the depths of your experience here and now."" True Meditation gives you the opportunity to reclaim the original purpose of meditation—as a gateway to ""the objectless freedom of being.""",1591794676,9781591794677),Hardcover,,104 pages,"

A young writer uncertain of what he wants to say, the man moves through tableaus of life in one of the most dynamic cities in the world: he hears the muezzin's call to prayer in the early morning light, and listens to John Coltrane during the late afternoon heat. He witnesses teenagers diligently perpetrating e-mail frauds from internet cafes, longs after a woman reading Michael Ondaatje on a public bus, and visits the impoverished National Museum. Along the way, he reconnects with old school friends and his family, who force him to ask himself profound questions of personal and national history.

","John Constantine, the main character in Hellblazer, was originally a very minor character in DC Comics' Swamp Thing. Next came his only series, in which this hard-smoking, hard-drinking, all around manipulator walked the thin line of magic between this world and hell. So when Irishman Garth Ennis was asked to write this comic book, he had asked himself, ""What could I possibly do to John Constantine that hadn't been done before? And one course of action suddenly stood out above all others: Kill him."" The result is a tense supernatural drama that begins with Constantine being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Though this book only hints at the freeform casualness and over-the-top vulgarity that became Ennis's trademark in the Preacher series, this is an immensely enjoyable read with strong characters and dynamite plot twists. --Jim PascoeCollects Hellblazer #41-46.",1563891506,9781563891502),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Practical Programming offers a different approach to exercise programming than that typically found in other exercise texts. Based on a combined 60+ years of academic expertise, elite-level coaching experience, and the observation of thousands of novice trainees, the authors present a chronological analysis of the response to exercise as it varies through the training history of the athlete, one that reflects the realities of human physiology, sports psychology, and common sense. Contrary to the one-size-fits-all models of periodization offered elsewhere, Practical Programming explains the differences in response to exercise commonly observed between athletes at the novice, intermediate, and advanced levels, explains these differences in the context of the relevant exercise science, and presents new training models that actually work for athletes at all levels of experience. Complete with new, innovative graphical representations of cutting-edge concepts in exercise programming, Practical Programming is sure to become a standard reference in the field of exercise and human performance.

From former Delta Force commander and New York Times bestselling author of Kill Bin Laden comes the first novel in an explosive new series.
After September 11, 2001, Delta Force troop commander Dalton Fury was given the secret mission to hunt down and kill the most wanted man in the world, the details of which were recounted in his extraordinary New York Times bestseller Kill Bin Laden. Now, Fury draws upon his hard-won combat experience ”and his gift for true-to-life storytelling” to offer a brand-new series of thrillers that are as close to reality as readers can get.Meet Kolt Raynor. A Delta Force operator and one-time American hero, he is still trying to make sense of his life ”and duty” after a secret mission gone bad. Three years ago, in the mountains of Pakistan, Raynor made a split-second decision to disobey orders ”one that got some of his teammates killed and the rest captured. Now he's been given a second chance to do right by his country, his men, and himself. But Raynor's shot at redemption comes at a price.A shadowy group of former colleagues has asked Raynor to return, alone, to Pakistan's badlands. His assignment seems clear: find his missing men and bring them home. What Raynor never expected was to uncover a sinister al Qaeda plot to capture a Black Site--a secret U.S. prison--and destabilize the region. Meanwhile, a ruthless, unknown enemy is on his trailâ€¦and he will stop at nothing to make sure that Raynor's mission is not accomplished.An intense, gritty work of edge-of-your-seat suspense, Black Site is the first of what promises to be one of the most exciting fiction series of the new millennium.",0312668376,9780312668372),Hardcover,,343 pages,"

","In this deeply etched and haunting memoir, Vivian Gornick tells the story of her lifelong battle with her mother for independence. There have been numerous books about mother and daughter, but none has dealt with this closest of filial relations as directly or as ruthlessly. Gornick's groundbreaking book confronts what Edna O'Brien has called ""the prinicpal crux of female despair"": the unacknowledged Oedipal nature of the mother-daughter bond.Born and raised in the Bronx, the daughter of ""urban peasants,"" Gornick grows up in a household dominated by her intelligent but uneducated mother's romantic depression over the early death of her husband. Next door lives Nettie, an attractive widow whose calculating sensuality appeals greatly to Vivian. These women with their opposing models of femininity continue, well into adulthood, to affect Gornick's struggle to find herself in love and in work.As Gornick walks with her aged mother through the streets of New York, arguing and remembering the past, each wins the reader's admiration: the caustic and clear-thinking daughter, for her courage and tenacity in really talking to her mother about the most basic issues of their lives, and the still powerful and intuitively-wise old woman, who again and again proves herself her daughter's mother.Unsparing, deeply courageous, Fierce Attachments is one of the most remarkable documents of family feeling that has been written, a classic that helped start the memoir boom and remains one of the most moving examples of the genre.",0374529965,9780374529963),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Soldaat van Oranje is niet alleen een spannend verhaal maar ook een historisch document over de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Prins Bernhard schreef niet voor niets over dit boek: ‘Ik ben erbij geweest, en zo was het.’Soldaat van Oranje is een van de beroemdste boeken over de Tweede Wereldoorlog. Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (1917-2007) beschrijft hierin zijn persoonlijke belevenissen tijdens de bezetting en ten tijde van de bevrijding. De Soldaat van Oranje vertelt hoe hij als jongeman in 1941 de oversteek naar Engeland waagt, in Londen in allerlei intriges verwikkeld raakt, kennismaakt met de geheime diensten, nachtelijke landingen uitvoert in Scheveningen en als RAF-piloot meedoet aan een luchtaanval op Berlijn. Nadat het zuiden van Nederland is bevrijd, werkt hij daar als adjudant van koningin Wilhelmina.In 1977 werd Soldaat van Oranje verfilmd onder regie van Paul Verhoeven met in de hoofdrollen Jeroen Krabbé en Rutger Hauer (Spectrum).",9023503627,9023503627,Paperback,17e druk,256 pages,"

His story continues to inspire millions of people around the world, and the foundation carrying his name raises millions of dollars every year.

That's how Rowan Areno sees her life now. Before: she was a normal sixteen-year-old--a little too sheltered by her police officer father and her mother. After: everything she once believed has been destroyed in the wake of a shattering tragedy, and every day is there to be survived.If she had known, on that Friday in March when she cut school, that a random stranger's shocking crime would have traumatic consequences, she never would have left campus. If the crime video never went viral, maybe she could have saved her mother, grandmother--and herself--from the endless replay of heartache and grief.Finding a soul mate in Eli, a witness to the crime who is haunted by losses of his own, Rowan begins to see there is no simple, straightforward path to healing wounded hearts.

","What would cause an eighteen-year-old old senior class president and homecoming queen from Nashville, Tennessee, to disobey and disappoint her parents by forgoing college, break her little brother’s heart, lose all but a handful of her friends (because the rest of them think she has gone off the deep end), and break up with the love of her life, all so she could move to Uganda, where she knew only one person but didn’t know any of the language? A passion to make a difference. Katie Davis left over Christmas break her senior year for a short mission trip to Uganda and her life was turned completely inside out. She found herself so moved, so broken by the people and the children of Uganda that she knew her calling was to return and care for them. Her story is like Mother Teresa’s in that she has given up everything—at such a young age—to care for the less fortunate of this world. Katie, a charismatic and articulate young woman, has gone on to adopt 14 children during her time in Uganda, and she completely trusts God for daily provision for her and her family, which includes children with special needs. To further her reach into the needs of Ugandans, Katie established Amazima Ministries. The ministry matches orphaned children with sponors worldwide. Each sponsor's $300/year provides schooling, school supplies, three hot meals a day, minor medical care, and spiritual encouragement. Katie expected to have forty children in the program; she had signed up 150 by January 2008; today it sponsors over 400. Another aspect of the ministry is a feeding program created for the displaced Karamojong people—Uganda's poorest citizens. The program feeds lunch to over 1200 children Monday-Friday and sends them home with a plate for food; it also offers basic medical care, Bible study, and general health training.Katie Davis, now 21, is more than fascinating, she's inspiring, as she has wholeheartedly answered the call to serve.",,,Kindle Edition,,252 pages,"

","Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon in which people, either upon falling asleep or awakening, temporarily experience the inability to move, and it is often associated with terrifying sensations. Sleep paralysis is known by many names across the world including ""Old Hag Syndrome"" in the west. Some claims it is caused by ""Shadow People,"" ""Hat Man,"" or various evil spiritual beings like demons. Some but not all cases of ""alien abductions"" or incubus and succubus attacks (spiritual rape) can be chalked up to a severe sleep paralysis episode. The author of this book claims to know how to do something that most sleep scientists say is impossible: to stop sleep paralysis for good. Chris White has helped thousands of people stop sleep paralysis through his nonprofit websites and videos, and has conducted one of the largest surveys ever done on the subject. This book is intended to be an overview of what sleep paralysis is, what causes it, and a detailed explanation of how to stop it. It also contains many personal accounts from people who have stopped sleep paralysis using the methods described by the author. ""What you showed me worked."" - Jonathan S.

In this story, Boaz fills the familial obligation to marry the widow of a deceased relative who never was able to father children, both to continue the family line and protect an otherwise vulnerable woman.The authors provide a critical, line-by-line commentary of the biblical text, presented in its original Hebrew, complete with vocalization and cantillation marks, as well as the 1985 JPS English translation. The extensive introduction places the book within its historical, literary, and critical context, discusses contemporary interpretations of the story of Ruth, and examines its major motifs and themes, among them: family, marriage and levirate marriage in biblical and ancient Israel, redemption and inheritance, hesed, and the book’s connection with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.",082760744X,9780827607446),Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","MURDER GOES VIRAL! They meet in an online chatroom dealing with depression and soon hatch a plan to bring meaning to their lives by encouraging other despondent individuals to help eradicate the ""scum of society,"" such as pedophiles and rapists who have escaped justice. Anyone dead set on committing suicide is urged to first kill someone who ""got away with it"" before taking their own life. Why not, they ask, ""take one with you?"" The idea goes viral and things rapidly spiral out of control. As they develop romantic feelings for each other, their worldwide followers begin to enact a very different version of the idea, perverting its original intent and threatening the thin line between civil society and criminal anarchy. Just as they find hope of happiness together, Charlie and Sarah must deal with the monster they've created, a global epidemic of murder-suicide that threatens the very core of their humanity. Take One With You is a unique crime thriller/millennial love story that poses the question: If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, would you kill someone tonight? Someone who had done something terrible. Someone who deserved to die. If so, who would it be? If you couldn't do it, what about your neighbor? Your friend? Your enemy? Who draws the line? Who decides who lives and who dies? And what if we all began to take justice into our own hands?",1495468453,9781495468452),Paperback,,216 pages,"

Almost immediately, crooked-bodied Eddie Kreezer, a roving obsessive with a violent streak, and a fading but lovely grifter named Glenda begin to do battle for Luli's head and heart. On their perilous journey westward, Luli is introduced to drifters, lowlifes, strippers, speed freaks, gold-diggers, and a Libertarian with a dog named Karl. Along the way, she learns the truth of American rootlessness and discovers both the power and the peril of her own sexual curiosity.

","Amid an inferno of explosives on a deadly minefield in the Korean War, a four-legged Marine proved to be a heroic force of nature. She moved headstrong up and down steep, smoky terrain that no man could travail confidently. In a single day, this small Mongolian mare made fifty-one round-trips carrying nearly five tons of explosives to various gun sites. Sergeant Reckless was her name, and she was the horse renowned for carrying wounded soldiers on and off the battlefield and making solo trips across combat zones to deliver supplies.A widely celebrated national hero, Reckless was first featured in 1954 in the Saturday Evening Post and more recently in 1997 when LIFE magazine published an edition lauding history’s one hundred all-time heroes. Equine enthusiast Robin Hutton learned about Sergeant Reckless and spearheaded the effort to commission a monument at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle (Quantico), VA. In July of 2013, the statue was unveiled. A second monument is planned for Camp Pendleton, where Reckless lived out her days and is buried.Hutton has now written the first-ever full biography of Sergeant Reckless, who earned two Purple Hearts for her heroic efforts (among other military decorations). Hutton has spoken with the Marines who fought alongside Reckless and tells the complete and captivating tale of how a would-be Korean racehorse became one of the greatest Marine wartime heroes. Sgt. Reckless brings the legend back to life more than half a century later.",1621572633,9781621572633),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

In this incendiary prototype, a minor tax dispute intensifies explosively, until the eponymous hero finds the forces of an entire kingdom, and even the great Martin Luther, gathered against him. But soon even Luther comes to echo the growing army of peasants asking, ""Isn’t Kohlhaas right?""Widely acknowledged as one of the masterworks of German literature, Michael Kohlhaas is also one of the most stirring tales ever written of the quest for justice.",0976140721,9780976140726),Paperback,,133 pages,"

When her father's secret past as a pirate came to light, father and daughter fled to a life at sea. Although Daniel McHenry's life had changed and he now robbed pirates to return the stolen goods to their rightful owners, his ship was captured by authorities, and he was hung for piracy.Skye grew up in an orphanage, little more than a servant and shunned by everyone around her. Now a young woman, each day Skye faces is marked by some new struggle.

She is awakened in the night by cannon blasts. Pirates storm the orphanage, drag her away into the night, and force her aboard their ship. The cruel captain's intentions are clear. He will extract from her, through any means necessary, the location of the hidden treasure rewarded to Daniel by those whose belongings he had returned.

","The companion volume to the ten-part PBS TV series by the team responsible forThe Civil War and Baseball.Continuing in the tradition of their critically acclaimed works, Geoffrey C. Ward and Ken Burns vividly bring to life the story of the quintessential American music—jazz. Born in the black community of turn-of-the-century New Orleans but played from the beginning by musicians of every color, jazz celebrates all Americans at their best.Here are the stories of the extraordinary men and women who made the music: Louis Armstrong, the fatherless waif whose unrivaled genius helped turn jazz into a soloist's art and influenced every singer, every instrumentalist who came after him; Duke Ellington, the pampered son of middle-class parents who turned a whole orchestra into his personal instrument, wrote nearly two thousand pieces for it, and captured more of American life than any other composer. Bix Beiderbecke, the doomed cornet prodigy who showed white musicians that they too could make an important contribution to the music; Benny Goodman, the immigrants' son who learned the clarinet to help feed his family, but who grew up to teach a whole country how to dance; Billie Holiday, whose distinctive style routinely transformed mediocre music into great art; Charlie Parker, who helped lead a musical revolution, only to destroy himself at thirty-four; and Miles Davis, whose search for fresh ways to sound made him the most influential jazz musician of his generation, and then led him to abandon jazz altogether. Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Tatum, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Artie Shaw, and Ella Fitzgerald are all here; so are Sidney Bechet, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, and a host of others.But Jazz is more than mere biography. The history of the music echoes the history of twentieth-century America. Jazz provided the background for the giddy era that F. Scott Fitzgerald called the Jazz Age. The irresistible pulse of big-band swing lifted the spirits and boosted American morale during the Great Depression and World War II. The virtuosic, demanding style called bebop mirrored the stepped-up pace and dislocation that came with peace. During the Cold War era, jazz served as a propaganda weapon—and forged links with the burgeoning counterculture. The story of jazz encompasses the story of American courtship and show business; the epic growth of great cities—New Orleans and Chicago, Kansas City and New York—and the struggle for civil rights and simple justice that continues into the new millennium.Visually stunning, with more than five hundred photographs, some never before published, this book, like the music it chronicles, is an exploration—and a celebration—of the American experiment.From the Hardcover edition.",0679765395,9780679765394),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Bea thinks she's the most boring seventeen-year-old in the world. She's not pretty or popular or funny, unlike her mother who had Bea when she was 17. The only glamorous thing about Bea is the French father who left before she was born and lives in Paris. She yearns for la vie Parisienne every moment of her dull existence. So when Ruby Davies, the leader of her school's most elite clique picks Bea as her new best friend and asks her to go on holiday with them, she's wary but delighted. If nothing else it's two weeks away from her over-protective mother . But when the gang arrive in Spain, Bea is crushed to realise that Ruby and her posse have simply been using her. Bea wreaks vengeance on her so-called friends, and plans to decamp to Paris to find her father. But when she falls asleep on the train and wakes up in Bilbao, she meets a group of American students who are backpacking around Europe and bonds with them straight away, especially the gorgeous Toph, who helps heal Bea's hurting heart. And though Bea has a shock in store when they finally get to Paris, the 'City of Lovers ' really works it magic on Bea and Toph, who spend a week wandering the sun-dappled streets of Paris, talking, holding hands and falling in love. When it comes time to go home to confront her Mum about her mysterious father, the new version of Bea is determined that she 'll never go back to her old, boring way of life - she's no longer Nobody's Girl; she belongs to herself and to Toph...But with an ocean between them, will he wait for her?",0340883731,9780340883730),Paperback,,370 pages,"

","When you understand it properly, the doctrine of vocation—""doing everything for God's glory""—is not a platitude or an outdated notion. This principle that we vaguely apply to our lives and our work is actually the key to Christian ethics, to influencing our culture for Christ, and to infusing our ordinary, everyday lives with the presence of God. For when we realize that the ""mundane"" activities that consume most of our time are ""God's hiding places,"" our perspective changes.Culture expert Gene Veith unpacks the biblical, Reformation teaching about the doctrine of vocation, emphasizing not what we should specifically do with our time or what careers we are called to, but what God does in and through our callings—even within the home. In each task He has given us—in our workplaces and families, our churches and society—God Himself is at work. Veith guides you to discover God's purpose and calling in those seemingly ordinary areas by providing you with a spiritual framework for thinking about such issues and for acting upon them with a changed perspective.",1581344031,9781581344035),Paperback,,176 pages,"

Or can she still make her own destiny? Naila’s conservative immigrant parents have always said the same thing: She may choose what to study, how to wear her hair, and what to be when she grows up—but they will choose her husband.

Despite her greatest efforts, Naila is aghast to find herself cut off from everything and everyone she once knew.

When twenty-five-year-old graduate assistant Caiden Brenner asked Blaire Leon how old she was, she said she was a senior. He chose to believe she meant in college. They connect over Lord Byron’s Don Juan and, as their conversations become increasingly thicker with sexual innuendo, Caiden finds himself obsessing over a totally off-limits undergrad who’s bold, beautiful, brilliant, and one of the most passionate poets he’s ever met. But it turns out Blaire hasn't been totally honest. She's the seventeen-year-old valedictorian of her high school class, taking courses at Sierra State while awaiting her acceptance to Stanford. Will Caiden get too deeply into Blaire to back away before he finds out the truth? Or will their connection be enough to seduce him into risking his entire future on Jail Bait?""A thousand and one feels....Getting Dirty is a thrilling, tantalizing forbidden romance you do not want to miss!

","Una noche estrellada es una de las maravillas más impactantes de la naturaleza, pero en nuestra era éstas son tan luminosas que es casi imposible experimentar la verdadera oscuridad. La exposición a la luz artificial ha probado ser un factor que afecta el ambiente, el bienestar y la salud: desde trastornos de sueño hasta casos de cáncer.En este libro, Paul Bogard viaja por el mundo en busca del hogar de la verdadera noche; en su recorrido mezcla narrativa personal, la historia natural, salud, ciencia y folclor para mostrar exactamente qué hemos perdido, qué nos queda y qué podemos aún recuperar.Desde el hotel Luxor en las Vegas -el lugar más brillante del planeta- hasta los desiertos más inhóspitos, nuestra experiencia moderna de la oscuridad se convierte en una breve y escueta vivencia. En una época en que la luz artificial se ha extendido desde las ciudades hasta los suburbios y pueblos rurales en donde las noches no son ni la sombra de lo que eran hacen veinte años, el autor observa las maneras en que la naturaleza lucha por seguir existiendo.La contaminación lumínica es una de las pocas que aún podemos combatir y el recorrido panorámico del planeta que este libro hace nos da suficientes razones para apagar la luz... al menos esta noche.""Volver a la luz de las estrellas y permitir que la sombra de la naturaleza reafirme su bálsamo me parecen objetivos modestos, nobles y profundos; el libro de Bogard hace la mejor defensa de ambos."" - The Guardian""Absorbente...

Once loved and respected in their community and in their church, they are ostracized by their neighbors, led by their church leader, and a seventeen-year feud between the Delaneys and the church ensues. Ava and her family are displaced from the community even as they continue to live within it, trapped inside their creaky, shadowy old house.When a mysterious woman arrives unexpectedly for a visit, her presence stirs up the past and ghosts and other restless things begin to emerge. And something is reignited in Ava: the indifferent woman she has become begins to give way to the wild girl, and the passionate artist, she used to be.

Her reward is a life in ruins, on the run in the wilderness, barely surviving a bitter winter and the even more bitter knowledge she has lost everything: her career, her reputation, her identity.

She championed the disadvantaged--black in the South, women in the North--yet spent much of her free life with middle-class whites, who supported her, yet never failed to remind her that she was a second class citizen. Slowly, but surely, Sojourner climbed from beneath the weight of slavery, secured respect for herself, and utilized the distinction of her race to become not only a symbol for black women, but for the feminist movement as a whole.",0393317080,9780393317084),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Henry David Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden. He was deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay. He was a strong abolitionist and his belief in a philosophy of civil disobedience influenced the political thoughts and actions of such later figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. First published in ""The Atlantic Monthly"" in 1862, Thoreau's essay begins with a history of the apple tree, and ends with a meditation on parallels between the wild apple and humanity.",1438526652,9781438526652),Paperback,,48 pages,"

We learn of Darcy's Christian name in very exciting circumstances. The ups and downs, the joys and woes of the characters will bring laughter and tears to many readers.

","The fifth grade. The threshold to puberty, and the beginning of the end of childhood innocence. Shuichi Nitori and his new friend Yoshino Takatsuki have happy homes, loving families, and are well-liked by their classmates. But they share a secret that further complicates a time of life that is awkward for anyone: Shuichi is a boy who wants to be a girl, and Yoshino is a girl who wants to be a boy. Written and drawn by one of today's most critically acclaimed creators of manga, Shimura portrays Shuishi and Yoshino's very private journey with affection, sensitivity, gentle humor, and unmistakable flair and grace. Book One introduces our two protagonists and the friends and family whose lives intersect with their own. Yoshino is rudely reminded of her sex by immature boys whose budding interest in girls takes clumsily cruel forms. Shuichi's secret is discovered by Saori, a perceptive and eccentric classmate. And it is Saori who suggests that the fifth graders put on a production of The Rose of Versailles for the farewell ceremony for the sixth graders, with boys playing the roles of women, and girls playing the roles of men. Wandering Son is a sophisticated work of literary manga translated with rare skill and sensitivity by veteran translator and comics scholar Matt Thorn.",1606994166,9781606994160),Hardcover,,210 pages,"

","Never before published in English, Orhan Pamuk’s second novel is the story of a Turkish family gathering in the shadow of the impending military coup of 1980. In an old mansion in Cennethisar, a former fishing village near Istanbul, a widow, Fatma, awaits the annual summer visit of her grandchildren. She has lived in the village for decades, ever since her husband, an idealistic young doctor, ran afoul of the sultan’s grand vizier and arrived to serve the poor fishermen. Now mostly bedridden, she is attended by her constant servant Recep, a dwarf—and the doctor’s illegitimate son. Despite mutual dependency, there is no love lost between mistress and servant, who have very different recollections—and grievances—from the early years, before Cennethisar grew into a high-class resort surrounding the family house, now in shambles. Though eagerly anticipated, Fatma’s grandchildren bring little consolation. The eldest, Faruk, a dissipated historian, wallows in alcohol as he laments his inability to tell the story of the past from the kaleidoscopic pieces he finds in the local archive; his sensitive leftist sister, Nilgün, has yet to discover the real-life consequences of highminded politics; and Metin, a high school nerd, tries to keep up with the lifestyle of his spoiled society schoolmates while he fantasizes about going to America—an unaffordable dream unless he can persuade his grandmother to tear down her house.  But it is Recep’s nephew Hasan, a high school dropout, lately fallen in with right-wing nationalists, who will draw the visiting family into the growing political cataclysm issuing from Turkey’s tumultuous century-long struggle for modernity.  By turns deeply moving, hilarious, and terrifying, Silent House pulses with the special energy of a great writer’s early work even as it offers beguiling evidence of the mature genius for which Orhan Pamuk would later be celebrated the world over.",0307700283,9780307700285),Hardcover,,334 pages,"

",لقد كانت حرب أكتوبر حدثاً فريداً بلا شك، بل نقطة تحول Turning Point في مسار الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي. فقد تعرضت إسرائيل كدولة لمفاجأة إستراتيجية كاملة أفقدت الإسرائيليين ثقتهم في جيشهم وفي جهاز مخابراتهم، الذي كان يدعي أنه أقدر جهاز مخابرات في العالم خبرة بشئون الشرق الأوسط. كما تعرضت القوات الإسرائيلية على جبهتي سيناء والجولان لمفاجأة تكتيكية أفقدت أفرادها توازنهم، وأجبرتهم على الإنسحاب من مواقعهم الأمامية. وكان الأمر الذي أدهش العالم هو نجاح مصر وسوريا في تحقيق المفاجأة على المستويين الإستراتيجي والتكتيكي - رغم التطور الهائل في وسائل الاستطلاع الحديثة - وقدرتهما على خداع جهازي المخابرات الإسرائيلية والمخابرات الأمريكية في وقت واحد.وبعد الإنتصار الباهر الذي أحرزته قواتنا المسلحة في حرب أكتوبر 1973 المجيدة، والذي استعادت به مصر كرامتها وشرفها وسمعتها أن يسجل هذا الكتاب الملحمة الحربية الفذة تسجيلاً أميناً بعيداً عن التحيز والمبالغة، وكذلك التحليل الفني لجميع أحداث ومواقف هذه الحرب بكل صراحة وصدق. مهتماً بإبراز نقاط الضعف والأخطاء التي ارتكبت نفس الإهتمام بنقاط القوة والتفوق التي ظهرت، إذ إن إبراز كلتا الناحيتين هو الوسيلة الصحيحة للإستفادة من دروس الحرب وتجاربها دون زيف أو خداع,9770908665,9770908665,Hardcover,,903 pages,"

","El modelo de Pickman es uno de los mejores cuentos de Howard Phillips Lovecraft. La historia gira en torno de Richard Upton Pickman, un desaparecido pintor, cuyos cuadros han cruzado la frontera de lo excéntrico para entrar en lo perversamente grotesco.Pero el suspenso y el horror del relato no están directamente ligados a los vívidos lienzos del artista, sino al modelo en el que fueron inspirados.Es una obra extraña para Lovecraft, cercana a ciertos clásicos de Poe, en la que convierte a toda la ciudad de Boston en un laberinto de pasadizos subterráneos que conectan el cementerio con el mar; túneles y sótanos donde se arrastran y susurran horrores sin nombre. Varios críticos consideran que el final de este relato es uno de los mejores y más escalofriantes de la literatura de terror.",,,Paperback,Clásicos del Terror,72 pages,"

","It should be known that human beings by nature have a concern and a strong desire to control the future as well as to seek to prevent loss of control. Mankind by nature, seeks order in a world or in an environment where that order may be threatened. Humans look for meaning in things. They look for a well-ordered system as well as patterns. Everything has divine coding that can slowly be unravelled through Numerology. Though it is permissible in Islam, crossing the limits is unacceptable. What is meant here by transgressing pass the boundaries is when numerologists delve into impermissible acts such as Astrology, Tarot reading, psychic reading, magic, and all those sciences and occultic acts that are completely impermissible in the revealed law. Just because the human hands have divine coding in them, it does not make palm reading permissible. Just because we all have star signs, it does not render horoscopic readings permissible. There is divine wisdom in the acts that are forbidden and even the acts that are permissible within the revealed law of Islam that step beyond the comprehension of the human intellect. If we follow this religious law, we will be safe and will not be imprisoned by the ego and desires, Satan and the world. We must be free from all this. This book reveals how non-Muslims use Numerology and what Islam says about it. This book is a great starter for anyone studying comparative religion or anyone interested in seeking further knowledge in the field of numerology, which essentially spun off from mathematics.",,,Kindle Edition,,39 pages,"

","“True crime at its best. … Barer has undeniable talent, pizzaz and imagination!”—Jack Olsen, bestselling author and award-winning journalist.  1982: Oregon businessman Phil Champagne, age 52, dies in a tragic boating accident off Lopez Island. He is survived by one ex-wife, four adult children, an octogenarian mother, and two despondent brothers. Phil didn't know he was dead until he read it in the paper. All things considered, he took it rather well. So did Phil's brother, Mitch, the beneficiary of a 1.5 million dollar policy on Phil's life.  1992: Wastington restauranteur Harold Stegeman, famous for his thick, juicy steaks, is arrested by the Secret Service for printing counterfeit United States currency in an Idaho shed. In addition to the bogus bills, Stegeman also has a fraudulently obtained passport, a fabricated Cayman Island drivers license, and Phil Champagne's fingerprints.  When the uproarious reality of Harold Stegeman's secret identity hit the headlines, the counterfeit resurrection of Phil Champagne became one of the most celebrated and hysterically funny true-crime stories of the twentieth century. And while every supermarket tabloid and television talk show hounded after the untold story, only Edgar Award winner Burl Barer captured Champagne's confidence and received permission to detail Phil's post-mortem career of fraud, deception, trickery, lies, and fine prime rib, bringing to life the exploits of a man his family thought dead over a decade ago.  “Crisp as a freshly printed C-note. Exceptionally clever and vastly entertaining!”—Lee Goldberg, author, screenwriter and television producer.  “Barer does it again! A deft and dazzling display of solid research and rapier wit—a must for all true crime aficionados.”—Gary C. King, author of To Die For.",,,Kindle Edition,,260 pages,"

Il protagonista (trentatreenne folgorato dalla constatazione che tutti i giusti, da Gesù Cristo a John Belushi, sono morti alla sua età) è un profano che lotta contro il sacro pur subendone il fascino. Un giorno gli appare la Madonna, il che lo stupisce molto, perchè di solito la Signora si presenta alle pastorelle ignoranti. Da questo incontro nasce una serie di eventi tra il tragico e il grottesco che conducono Lazzaro a rendersi conto che l'Apparizione è tutt'altro che un buon segno. In una fine secolo che ha bisogno di valori, forse perfino di apparizioni vere e false, Lazzaro, pur non essendo uno stinco di santo, si trova a fronteggiare baci di Giuda, personalissime vie crucis, miracoli, efferati delitti.",880443659X,9788804436591),Paperback,Scrittori italiani,490 pages,"

Unlike the duo, who are seen during their regime as the people’s president – Nikolai took a detour, believing that the best way to rule a country is to instill fear and awe into his citizens- this tyrannical rule doesn’t go well with some of the country’s overlords as plots were put in place to eliminate Viktor’s only son and to finally put an end to the Lupechenkos’ grapple to power.",B015HM69PA,B015HM69PA,,,,,[]

","رد على أسئله لملحدين على الدين الإسلامي, رد رائع بالدلائل والأمثله يجيب عن تساؤلات عقلنا فى فترة ما نمر بها ويرد بها على الآخرين الماديين.صديقى رجل يحب الجدل ويهوى الكلام وهو يعتقد أننا نحن المؤمنون السذج نقتات بالاوهام ونضحك على أنفسنا بالجنة والحوار العين وتفوتنا لذات الدنيا ومفاتنها.. وصديقى بهذه المناسبة تخرج من فرنسا وحصل على دكتوراه وعاش مع الهيبيز وأصبح ينكر كل شئ. قال لى ساخرا: -انتم تقولون: ان الله موجود، وعمدة براهينكم هو قانون ""السببية"" الذى ينص على أن لكل صنعة صانعا ولكل خلق خالقاً ولكل وجود موجدا.. النسيج يدل على النساج والرسم على الرسام والنقش على النقاش والكون بهذا المنطق أبلغ دليل على الاله القدير الذى خلقه. صدقنا وآمنا بهذا الخالق.. ألا يحق لنا بنفس المنطق أن نسأل.. ومن خلق الخالق.. من خلق الله الذى تحدثوننا عنه.. ألا تقودنا نفس استدلالاتكم الى هذا.. وتبعا لنفس قانون السببية.. ما رأيكم فى هذا المطب دام فضلكم؟. ونحن نقول له: سؤالك فاسد.. ولا مطب ولا حاجة فأنت تسلم بأن الله خالق ثم تقول من خلقه؟! فتجعل منه خالقا ومخلوقا فى نفس الجملة وهذا تناقض، والوجه الآخر لفساد السؤال أنك تتصور خضوع الخالق لقوانين مخلوقاته.. فالسببية قانوننا نحن أبناء الزمان والمكان. والله الذى خلق الزمان والمكان هو بالضرورة فوق الزمان والمكان ولا يصح لنا أن نتصوره مقيدا بالزمان والمكان ولا بقوانين الزمان والمكان. والله هو الذى خلق قانون السببية فلا يجوز أن نتصوره خاضعا لقانون السببية الذى خلقه، وأنت بهذه السفسطة أشبه بالعرائس التى تتحرك بزمبلك وتتصور أن الانسان الذى صنعها لابد هو الآخر يتحرك بزمبلك.. فاذا قلنا لها بل هو يتحرك من تلقاء نفسه.. قالت: مستحيل أن يتحرك شئ من تلقاء نفسه.. انى أرى فى عالمى كل شئ يتحرك بزمبلك، وأنت بالمثل لا تتصور أن الله موجود بذاته بدون موجد.. لمجرد أنك ترى كل شئ حولك فى حاجة الى موجد.لتحميل كتاب حوار مع صديقي الملحد برابط بسيط وسهل من هذا الرابط http://mmaqara2t.com/index.php/books/...وللتحميل المزيد من الكتب المباشره من الموقع",9770509845,9770509845,,,142 pages,"

From the bestselling, Edgar Award–winning author of the “terrifically good” (The New York Times) Red Sparrow, a compulsively readable new novel about star-crossed Russian agent Dominika Egorova and CIA's Nate Nash in a desperate race to the finish.
Captain Dominika Egorova of the Russian Intelligence Service (SVR) has returned from the West to Moscow. She despises the men she serves, the oligarchs, and crooks, and thugs of Putin’s Russia. What no one knows is that Dominika is working for the CIA as Washington’s most sensitive penetration of SVR and the Kremlin.As she expertly dodges exposure, Dominika deals with a murderously psychotic boss; survives an Iranian assassination attempt; escapes a counterintelligence ambush; rescues an arrested agent and exfiltrates him out of Russia; and has a chilling midnight conversation in her nightgown with President Putin. Complicating these risks is the fact that Dominika is in love with her CIA handler, Nate Nash, and their lust is as dangerous as committing espionage in Moscow. And when a mole in the SVR finds Dominika’s name on a restricted list of sources, it is a virtual death sentence…Just as fast-paced, heart-pounding, and action-packed as Red Sparrow, Jason Matthews’s second novel confirms he is “an insider’s insider…and a masterful storyteller” (Vince Flynn, #1 New York Times bestselling author).",1476793743,9781476793740),Hardcover,,480 pages,"

","American privateer, Captain Jack isn't really an American, but heir to a viscountcy. When his father dies, he leaves everything not entailed with the estate to his worthless cousin. Jack's only hope of inheriting his mother's ancestral home and honoring her dying wish is to marry and produce an heir before his thirty-fifth birthday—in five months. And he doesn't have a single prospect. Pregnant and unwed, Abigail Halsey is sent by her father to an Anglican convent until he can find a family to adopt his grandchild or a husband for his daughter. Abby has other plans, but they go awry when she goes into labor early and her rescuer, a pirate captain turned lord, insists on marrying her. Is Jack too much like his jealous, unforgiving father? Can Abby overcome her fear of men and have a real marriage? Or will she never be anything more than the unwanted wife of a Slightly Noble Viscount?",1628307781,9781628307788),Paperback,,376 pages,"

","On a chilly February day, two old friends meet in the throng outside a London crematorium to pay their last respects to Molly Lane. Both Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday had been Molly's lovers in the days before they reached their current eminence: Clive is Britain's most successful modern composer, and Vernon is editor of the newspaper The Judge. Gorgeous, feisty Molly had other lovers, too, notably Julian Garmony, Foreign Secretary, a notorious right-winger tipped to be the next prime minister.In the days that follow Molly's funeral, Clive and Vernon will make a pact with consequences that neither could have foreseen. Each will make a disastrous moral decision, their friendship will be tested to its limits, and Julian Garmony will be fighting for his political life. A sharp contemporary morality tale, cleverly disguised as a comic novel, Amsterdam is ""as sheerly enjoyable a book as one is likely to pick up this year"" (The Washington Post Book World).",0385494246,9780385494243),Paperback,First U.S.,208 pages,"

","In Viking times, Norse myths predicted the end of the world, an event called Ragnarok, that only the gods can stop. When this apocalypse happens, the gods must battle the monsters--wolves the size of the sun, serpents that span the seabeds, all bent on destroying the world.The gods died a long time ago.Matt Thorsen knows every Norse myth, saga, and god as if it was family history--because it is family history. Most people in the modern-day town of Blackwell, South Dakota, in fact, are direct descendants of either Thor or Loki, including Matt's classmates Fen and Laurie Brekke.However, knowing the legends and completely believing them are two different things. When the rune readers reveal that Ragnarok is coming and kids--led by Matt--will stand in for the gods in the final battle, he can hardly believe it. Matt, Laurie, and Fen's lives will never be the same as they race to put together an unstoppable team to prevent the end of the world.",1907411305,9781907411304),Paperback,,358 pages,"

Wolf’s-own: Book Three
After saving his people, killing the man he once loved, and losing his little sister, Fen Jacin-rei has made his way to Tambalon with his surviving brothers and Kamen Malick. But shortly after arriving, old ghosts resurface, new dangers arise, and Malick tells Fen the gods aren’t done with him yet.Fen now knows he’s a catalyst for Fate and a magnet for Fate’s players, and he’s dangerously close to falling over the edge into insanity. But tracking down the vicious creatures that have been abducting and murdering citizens of Tambalon is just as critical as dealing with past lives and legendary beings.With a threat all too close and a secret he needs to explain, Malick is at odds with those who should be his allies, and no matter how much he wants to protect Fen, it may be more than he can manage when he’s trying to keep them alive.",,,ebook,2nd Edition,310 pages,"

","An alternate cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Rachel Verinder, a young Englishwoman, inherits a large Indian diamond on her eighteenth birthday. It is a legacy from her uncle, a corrupt English army officer who served in India. The diamond is of great religious significance as well as being extremely valuable, and three Hindu priests have dedicated their lives to recovering it. The story incorporates elements of the legendary origins of the Hope Diamond (or perhaps the Orloff Diamond). Rachel's eighteenth birthday is celebrated with a large party, whose guests include her cousin Franklin Blake. She wears the Moonstone on her dress that evening for all to see, including some Indian jugglers who have called at the house. Later that night, the diamond is stolen from Rachel's bedroom, and a period of turmoil, unhappiness, misunderstandings and ill-luck ensues. Told by a series of narratives from some of the main characters, the complex plot traces the subsequent efforts to explain the theft, identify the thief, trace the stone and recover it.",1853260444,9781853260445),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","Fiction. Your TV is watching you. Your cell phone is listening to everything you say. There are no secrets, no quiet moments. There is no privacy. Behind the veil of work and life, Democracy, free enterprise, and the roar of restaurants, bars, and blockbuster movies there are the Watchers a secret branch of the US government with the sole task of spying on the American public through hidden cameras, tapped phones, the Internet, satellites, and even safe, sensible modern appliances. Then one day a young man named Joe Blake looks back through the monitor, locks eyes with an aging Watcher and says, ""I know you're out there. I know you're listening."" Systems at the Watcher compound go dark, malfunctions run rampant, and the agency begins a meticulous investigation into Joe's life. Through the surveillance record we watch as he grows into a troubled rock star witnessing the downward spiral of the American economy from the road. We watch his fight against a corrupt corporate takeover of a government formally by and for the people, and we see the end of our way of life in the small compromises that go overlooked or unnoticed. Joe declares war on the system, but can he complete his mission before the Watchers track him down through his own past? In a race against time, who wins, the people or the money?""",1940233062,9781940233062),Paperback,,558 pages,"

","A pioneering researcher and one of the world’s foremost experts on traumatic stress offers a bold new paradigm for healing. Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Such experiences inevitably leave traces on minds, emotions, and even on biology. Sadly, trauma sufferers frequently pass on their stress to their partners and children. Renowned trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he transforms our understanding of traumatic stress, revealing how it literally rearranges the brain’s wiring—specifically areas dedicated to pleasure, engagement, control, and trust. He shows how these areas can be reactivated through innovative treatments including neurofeedback, mindfulness techniques, play, yoga, and other therapies. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score offers proven alternatives to drugs and talk therapy—and a way to reclaim lives.",0670785938,9780670785933),Hardcover,,443 pages,"

","‘The plot is the source and the soul of tragedy’In his near-contemporary account of Greek tragedy, Aristotle examines the dramatic elements of plot, character, language and spectacle that combine to produce pity and fear in the audience, and asks why we derive pleasure from this apparently painful process. Taking examples from the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, The Poetics introduces into literary criticism such central concepts as mimesis (‘imitation’), hamartia (‘error’), and katharsis (‘purification’). Aristotle explains how the most effective tragedies rely on complication and resolution, recognition and reversals, centring on characters of heroic stature, idealized yet true to life. One of the most powerful, perceptive and influential works of criticism in Western literary history, the Poetics has informed serious thinking about drama ever since.Malcolm Heath’s lucid English translation makes the Poetics fully accessible to the modern reader. It is accompanied by an extended introduction, which discusses the key concepts in detail and includes suggestions for further reading.",0140446362,9780140446364),Paperback,,61 pages,"

","In October 1843, Charles Dickens ― heavily in debt and obligated to his publisher ― began work on a book to help supplement his family's meager income. That volume, A Christmas Carol, has long since become one of the most beloved stories in the English language. As much a part of the holiday season as holly, mistletoe, and evergreen wreaths, this perennial favorite continues to delight new readers and rekindle thoughts of charity and goodwill.With its characters exhibiting many qualities ― as well as failures ― often ascribed to Dickens himself, the imaginative and entertaining tale relates Ebenezer Scrooge's eerie encounters with a series of spectral visitors. Journeying with them through Christmases past, present, and future, he is ultimately transformed from an arrogant, obstinate, and insensitive miser to a generous, warmhearted, and caring human being. Written by one of England's greatest and most popular novelists, A Christmas Carol has come to epitomize the true meaning of Christmas.",0486268659,9780486268651),Paperback,Dover Thrift Editions,68 pages,"

","Long before she ran away with Paris to Troy, Helen of Sparta was haunted by nightmares of a burning city under siege. These dreams foretold impending war—a war that only Helen has the power to avert. To do so, she must defy her family and betray her betrothed by fleeing the palace in the dead of night. In need of protection, she finds shelter and comfort in the arms of Theseus, son of Poseidon. With Theseus at her side, she believes she can escape her destiny. But at every turn, new dangers—violence, betrayal, extortion, threat of war—thwart Helen’s plans and bar her path. Still, she refuses to bend to the will of the gods.A new take on an ancient myth, Helen of Sparta is the story of one woman determined to decide her own fate.The sequel to Helen of Sparta will be published by Lake Union Publishing in May 2016.",1477821384,9781477821381),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, and been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft. The secret to Col. Hadfield's success-and survival-is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst-and enjoy every moment of it. In An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth, Col. Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counterintuitive lessons: don't visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff. You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Col. Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.",1447259947,9781447259947),Paperback,,311 pages,"

","In his Confessions Jean-Jacques Rousseau tells the story of his life, from the formative experience of his humble childhood in Geneva, through the achievement of international fame as novelist and philosopher in Paris, to his wanderings as an exile, persecuted by governments and alienated from the world of modern civilization. In trying to explain who he was and how he came to be the object of others' admiration and abuse, Rousseau analyses with unique insight the relationship between an elusive but essential inner self and the variety of social identities he was led to adopt. The book vividly illustrates the mixture of moods and motives that underlie the writing of autobiography: defiance and vulnerability, self-exploration and denial, passion, puzzlement, and detachment. Above all, Confessions is Rousseau's search, through every resource of language, to convey what he despairs of putting into words: the personal quality of one's own existence.",0192822756,9780192822758),Paperback,Oxford World's Classics,676 pages,"

","Kathryn Hughes’ new ebook The Letter offers readers a chance to absorb themselves in the lives of two women, born decades apart but whose lives share a number of parallels. The novel explores two historical strands, bringing together an abused housewife from the 1970s and a young girl from the early 1940s in a story of love, loss and unexpected consequences.The Letter follows the life of Tina in the 1970s who seeks respite from her abusive marriage by volunteering at a charity shop. One day, while sorting through the pockets of a second-hand suit, she comes across an old letter. It is still firmly sealed and un-franked. Unable to resist the pull of curiosity, Tina opens the letter. It was written on 4th September 1939. She is so moved by the contents and bemused as to why the letter was never delivered, she embarks on a quest to find out what became of the writer and his intended recipient.The mystery of how this love letter ended up in Tina’s hands is also uncovered through Billy’s story from the early 1940s. He writes a letter that will change his life forever, unaware that it will not be read for another 34 years, and then by a complete stranger.With a swift pace, memorable characters and a wonderful conceptual depth, Hughes’ novel is one that simply can’t be put down.",,,ebook,,265 pages,"

","Though the Greek and Roman crewmembers of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen—all of them—and they're stronger than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood—the blood of Olympus—in order to wake.The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it ""might"" be able to stop a war between the two camps.The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.",0606383352,9780606383356),Hardcover,,544 pages,"

","Segundo Orwell, 1984 é uma sátira, onde aliás se detecta inspiração swifteana. De aparência naturalista, trata das realidades e do terror do poder político, não apenas num determinado país, mas no mundo — num mundo uniformizado. Foi escrito como um ataque a todos os factores que na sociedade moderna podem conduzir a uma vida de privação e embrutecimento, não pretendendo ser a «profecia» de coisa nenhuma.1984 oferece hoje uma descrição quase realista do vastíssimo sistema de fiscalização em que passaram a assentar as democracias capitalistas. A electrónica permite, pela primeira vez na história da humanidade, reunir nos mesmos instrumentos e nos mesmos gestos o trabalho e a fiscalização exercida sobre o trabalhador. O Big Brother já não é uma figura de estilo - converteu-se numa vulgaridade quotidiana.http://static.publico.pt/docs/cmf/aut...",8481305626,9788481305623),Hardcover,"Colecção Mil folhas, #25",320 pages,"

","My name is Slade Merrick and I’m a fucking sex addict . . .  I’ve been told it’s a problem. But I see it as a passion; something that I’m good at. And who the fuck stops something that they’re good at?  They want me to seek help; get my cock in check. Don't judge my lifestyle. You’re no better than me. Just admit it, you like to fuck too. Sex is what I do best; my own personal high, so I embrace it instead of being ashamed.  When I'm not fucking, I'm slinging drinks at Walk Of Shame or stripping my way into your bed; another thing I'm good at. Every woman’s darkest fantasy brought to life.  So, am I stopping? Fuck no. Sex is beautiful, raw and erotic and I get off knowing I can have it with anyone I want . . . with the exception of her.  Aspen.  She walks into the club swaying those hips, instantly drawing my cock to attention. She’s pure perfection. That is, until she opens that mouth, drawing me in and for the first time in forever I want something more than sex. I want her and she hates it.  Things get dirty. Dirty is what I like; it’s how I live. But . . . she’s playing a game she can never win.  ***Author's note*** Due to strong language and a very high amount of dirty, sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.

","The third tale from the Mazalan Book of the Fallen, Memories of Ice is a convoluted military fantasy even more dense than its two predecessors. A deranged and not necessarily human prophet has set a cannibal rabble to conquer a continent, and various armies and wizards are out to stop him--but their reasons for doing this are many, various and often conflicting. The previous two books Gardens of the Moon and Deadhouse Gates were full of mysteries, some of them answered here--Erikson's is a world in which gods ascend from humanity to replace gods that fall or are overthrown and in which the world and the supernatural warrants that surround it are full of relics of past gods and past cultures. Young officer Paran tries to make sense of the return of his dead beloved as one of the four souls of a magical child; his commander Whiskeyjack tries to do the right thing as both soldier and human being; the scout Toc tries to survive hideous torture and pass on information he only partly knows. Erikson creates an impressive dark world of brutality and sudden beauty in which dizzying vistas of times past suddenly open; his work repays the concentration needed to follow his complex plotting and sentences. --Roz Kaveney",0593046242,9780593046241),Paperback,,898 pages,"

Armed only with a frying pan and her common sense, Tiffany Aching, a young witch-to-be, is all that stands between the monsters of Fairyland and the warm, green Chalk country that is her home. Forced into Fairyland to seek her kidnaped brother, Tiffany allies herself with the Chalk's local Nac Mac Feegle -- aka the Wee Free Men -- a clan of sheep-stealing, sword-wielding, six-inch-high blue men who are as fierce as they are funny. Together they battle through an eerie and ever-shifting landscape, fighting brutal flying fairies, dream-spinning dromes, and grimhounds -- black dogs with eyes of fire and teeth of razors -- before ultimately confronting the Queen of the Elves, absolute ruler of a world in which reality intertwines with nightmare. And in the final showdown, Tiffany must face her cruel power alone....In a riveting narrative that is equal parts suspense and humor, Carnegie Medalist Terry Pratchett returns to his internationally popular Discworld with a breathtaking tale certain to leave fans, new and old, enthralled.",0060785985,9780060785987),Audio CD,Unabridged,7 pages,"

Once there, he encounters a horror of violence and gore he could not have imagined and sustains his spirit with only the words on the pages from home and the camaraderie of the mud-covered Irish boys who fight and die by his side.  Dimly aware of the political tensions that have grown in Ireland in his absence, Willie returns on leave to find a world split and ravaged by forces closer to home. Despite the comfort he finds with his family, he knows he must rejoin his regiment and fight until the end. With grace and power, Sebastian Barry vividly renders Willie’s personal struggle as well as the overwhelming consequences of war.",0571231829,9780571231829),Paperback,,292 pages,"

During those eleven days, did she have time to write a play? Jordan Bingham needs a new job and a new place to live. She’s back in Harrison Falls, New York, living with her not so law-abiding uncles, in debt thanks to a credit card–stealing ex and pending grad school loans. Enter the perfect job, a research position that includes room and board, which will allow her to spend her days hunting down rare mysteries for an avid book collector. There’s just one problem: her employer, Vera Van Alst—the most hated citizen of Harrison Falls. Jordan’s first assignment is to track down a rumored Agatha Christie play. It seems easy enough, but Jordan soon finds out that her predecessor was killed while looking for it, and there is still someone out there willing to murder to keep the play out of Vera’s hands.

","Gathered together for the first time, a gourmet selection of the most read, most shared, and most insulted columns by the Bengal tiger Lucano Divina! After escaping from the Acheron Zoo, Lucano has been involved in the struggle against the imperialism of human stupidity, touching a range of subjects such as: the worst advice for a broken heart, you don’t know what you got until someone else enjoys it, love gets better with damage, profession is the oldest prostitution in the world, and twenty-one things you shouldn’t do to forget your ex, among other irrational truths. Thanks to his writings that strip the self-denominated most intelligent species on the planet, he has shown himself worthy of five death threats that would turn him into a rug, at least ten emails after each publication that seek to drive him mad with offenses, more than two-hundred thousand followers on social media, nineteen marriage proposals, and a previous book (Prince Charming Opens Doors, the Buffoon Opens Legs) that continues to enjoy sales success. Livin’ la Vida Boba not only compiles the highest peaks of the aforementioned struggle—from September 3, 2007 to December 31, 2015—but also frames them in a new human life cycle: you are born, you grow up, you try to reproduce, you get cheated on, you reproduce (with another partner), and you die.",,,Kindle Edition,1,198 pages,"

"," A book of Raw Emotion!    In Harpie’s wacky, psycho, screwball, demented book she bares her soul, revealing her innermost thoughts, slashing a metaphoric vein and bleeding onto the page   Harpie’s deepest and most intimate feelings gush from her, revealing anxieties ranging from her feelings for her mother, who died in tragic and suspicious circumstances, to her resentment towards her father. And then there were others who abused her physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually. All this is tied up and interwoven with her love of her young son, Mike.  Harpie has memories buried deep in shadowy parts of her subconscious that she’s never been able to reach. They include the mystery surrounding her mother’s murder. With the help of a clinical psychologist and regressive hypnotism, she revisits the past as she dips in and out of Now and Then.  In 'Vodka' Harpie uncovers the missing parts her lost childhood.  More than a modern-day and quirky diary, this is the story of one woman’s life in a typical English small town, encompassing the characters, texture and mentality of everyday living, told with brutal and shameless honesty while all the while cross-threading with a struggle for survival and acceptance.  This is no jump on the bandwagon 'pity me' story, as the vein of humour running through every chapter is testament. Harpie’s goal in writing ‘Vodka’ is to prove to the cynics that it can be done. She can write her truth and miss nothing out – heart attacks, miscarriages, beatings, blood gushing, sex, poverty, mayhem, men and vodka - and always with that beautiful self-deprecating sense of humour common to the British.  After suffering a miscarriage, followed by a heart attack and having stopped breathing in intensive care she signs herself out of the hospital, clothing caked in dried blood, because there’s nobody at home to see to the animals. The following day Harpie berates herself for just sitting about moping all day on the sofa, so scrubs herself up and goes down the pub. The next day she walks four miles to the hospital to pick her car up, reasoning that “the walk might do me some good.” You can’t help but admire and applaud her efforts to keep her life on track, staying in work and as a single mum ensuring her child has a safe home life.  This book began as a social experiment in honesty after a debate among authors about how honest it's possible to be. Harpie set out to prove that everything can be written, the good, the bad and the shameful. There is nowhere that this woman won’t go. If there’s a line to cross, Harpie will stick out her chest and limbo under it, jump over it or dance through it with a glass of vodka in her hand while never spilling a drop.   This is a book of raw emotion …. And it bleeds   KW ",,,Kindle Edition,,582 pages,"

","""Quo vadis Domine"" is Latin for ""Where are you going, Lord?"" and alludes to the apocryphal Acts of Peter, in which Peter flees Rome but on his way meets Jesus and asks him why he is going to Rome. Jesus says, ""I am going back to be crucified again"", which makes Peter go back to Rome and accept martyrdom.The novel Quo Vadis tells of a love that develops between a young Christian woman, Ligia, and Marcus Vinicius, a Roman patrician. It takes place in the city of Rome under the rule of emperor Nero, c. AD 64. Sienkiewicz studied the Roman Empire extensively prior to writing the novel, with the aim of getting historical details correct. Consequently, several historical figures appear in the book.Published in installments in three Polish dailies in 1895, it came out in book form in 1896 and has since been translated into more than 50 languages. Quo Vadis contributed to Sienkiewicz's Nobel Prize for literature in 1905.",1934169072,9781934169070),Paperback,,596 pages,"

Hours later, the world as we know it begins to dissolve. Moving back and forth in time—from the actor's early days as a film star to fifteen years in the future, when a theater troupe known as the Traveling Symphony roams the wasteland of what remains—this suspenseful, elegiac, spellbinding novel charts the strange twists of fate that connect five people: the actor, the man who tried to save him, the actor's first wife, his oldest friend, and a young actress with the Traveling Symphony, caught in the crosshairs of a dangerous self-proclaimed prophet.",,,Kindle Edition,,354 pages,"

","Marcus Aemilius Scaurus non sentiva dentro di sé un'autentica vocazione guerriera: aveva intrapreso la carriera militare come tribuno dell'esercito di Roma solo perché era un buon trampolino per la sua futura carriera politica. Ma quando la sua spada, infusa della magia degli antichi druidi, toccò la lama del capo celta Viridovix, egualmente incantata, l'intera legione - e Viridovix con essa - fu trascinata in un altro tempo e in un altro spazio.Nel magnifico ma tormentato impero di Videssos i romani erano esuli, stranieri in terra straniera. Solo con il coraggio, con le spade e con la perizia militare la legione perduta poteva ritagliarsi un posto adeguato nella storia della sua nuova, fantastica patria.I barbari Yezda, istigati dal perfido mago Avshar, dilagavano nelle terre dell'Impero portando la disperazione e la morte in nome del satanico dio Skotos.L'Impero aveva bisogno di mercenari, ma Marco Emilio Scauro non avrebbe mai immaginato di dover marciare con imperatore Mavrikios Gavras verso la battaglia finale!",,,Hardcover,,374 pages,"

","A captivating, beautiful, and stunningly accomplished debut novel that opens in 1918 Australia - the story of a lighthouse keeper and his wife who make one devastating choice that forever changes two worlds. Australia, 1926. After four harrowing years fighting on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns home to take a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day's journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season and shore leaves are granted every other year at best, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby's cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby. Tom, whose records as a lighthouse keeper are meticulous and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel has taken the tiny baby to her breast. Against Tom's judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them. M. L. Stedman's mesmerizing, beautifully written debut novel seduces us into accommodating Isabel's decision to keep this ""gift from God."" And we are swept into a story about extraordinarily compelling characters seeking to find their North Star in a world where there is no right answer, where justice for one person is another's tragic loss.",1742755712,9781742755717),Mass Market Paperback,,362 pages,"

","Juan Rulfo is one of the most important writers of twentieth-century Mexico, though he wrote only two books—the novel Pedro Páramo (1955) and the short story collection El llano en llamas (1953). First translated into English in 1967 as The Burning Plain, these starkly realistic stories create a psychologically acute portrait of poverty and dignity in the countryside at a time when Mexico was undergoing rapid industrialization following the upheavals of the Revolution. According to Ilan Stavans, the stories’ “depth seems almost inexhaustible: with a few strokes, Rulfo creates a complex human landscape defined by desolation. These stories are lessons in morality. . . . They are also astonishing examples of artistic distillation.”To introduce a new generation of readers to Rulfo’s unsurpassable literary talents, this new translation repositions the collection as a classic of world literature. Working from the definitive Spanish edition of El llano en llamas established by the Fundación Juan Rulfo, Ilan Stavans and co-translator Harold Augenbram present fresh translations of the original fifteen stories, as well as two more stories that have not appeared in English before—“The Legacy of Matilde Arcángel” and “The Day of the Collapse.” The translators have artfully preserved the author’s “peasantisms,” in appreciation of the distinctive voices of his characters. Such careful, elegiac rendering of the stories perfectly suits Rulfo’s Mexico, in which people on the edge of despair nonetheless retain a sense of self, of integrity that will not be taken away.",0292743858,9780292743854),Paperback,,122 pages,"

","With unequaled insight and brio, David Brooks, the New York Times columnist and bestselling author of Bobos in Paradise, has long explored and explained the way we live. Now, with the intellectual curiosity and emotional wisdom that make his columns among the most read in the nation, Brooks turns to the building blocks of human flourishing in a multilayered, profoundly illuminating work grounded in everyday life.This is the story of how success happens. It is told through the lives of one composite American couple, Harold and Erica—how they grow, push forward, are pulled back, fail, and succeed. Distilling a vast array of information into these two vividly realized characters, Brooks illustrates a fundamental new understanding of human nature. A scientific revolution has occurred—we have learned more about the human brain in the last thirty years than we had in the previous three thousand. The unconscious mind, it turns out, is most of the mind—not a dark, vestigial place but a creative and enchanted one, where most of the brain’s work gets done. This is the realm of emotions, intuitions, biases, longings, genetic predispositions, personality traits, and social norms: the realm where character is formed and where our most important life decisions are made. The natural habitat of The Social Animal. Drawing on a wealth of current research from numerous disciplines, Brooks takes Harold and Erica from infancy to school; from the “odyssey years” that have come to define young adulthood to the high walls of poverty; from the nature of attachment, love, and commitment, to the nature of effective leadership. He reveals the deeply social aspect of our very minds and exposes the bias in modern culture that overemphasizes rationalism, individualism, and IQ. Along the way, he demolishes conventional definitions of success while looking toward a culture based on trust and humility.The Social Animal is a moving and nuanced intellectual adventure, a story of achievement and a defense of progress. Impossible to put down, it is an essential book for our time, one that will have broad social impact and will change the way we see ourselves and the world.",140006760X,9781400067602),Hardcover,,424 pages,"

Magic runs through them and their land.”With her boundless curiosity and wild spirit, Fer has always felt that she doesn’t belong. Not when the forest is calling to her, when the rush of wind through branches feels more real than school or the quiet farms near her house. Then she saves an injured creature—he looks like a boy, but he’s really something else.

","An alternate cover edition for this ASIN can be found hereLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.Unparalleled in scope and execution, A Game of Thrones is one of those rare reading experiences that catch you up from the opening pages, won’t let you go until the end, and leave you yearning for more.",,,Kindle Edition,,819 pages,"

","A mesmerizing tale of psychological suspense about a woman who must fight to escape an expert manipulator determined to possess her, Claire Kendal’s debut novel is a sophisticated and disturbing portrait of compulsion, control, and terror that will appeal to fans of Before I Go to Sleep, The Silent Wife, and Into the Darkest Corner.His name is Rafe, and he is everywhere Clarissa turns. At the university where she works. Her favorite sewing shop. The train station. Outside her apartment. His messages choke her voice mail; his gifts litter her mailbox. Since that one regrettable night, his obsession with her has grown, becoming more terrifying with each passing day. And as Rafe has made clear, he will never let her go.Clarissa’s only escape from this harrowing nightmare is inside a courtroom—where she is a juror on a trial involving a victim whose experiences eerily parallel her own. There she finds some peace and even makes new friends, including an attractive widower named Robert, whose caring attentions make her feel desired and safe. But as a disturbingly violent crime unfolds in the courtroom, Clarissa realizes that to survive she must expose Rafe herself. Conceiving a plan, she begins collecting the evidence of Rafe’s madness to use against him—a record of terror that will force her to relive every excruciating moment she desperately wants to forget. Proof that will reveal the twisted, macabre fairy tale that Rafe has spun around them . . . with an ending more horrifying than her darkest fears.Masterfully constructed, filled with exquisite tension and a pervasive sense of menace, The Book of You explores the lines between love and compulsion, fantasy and reality, and offers a heart-stopping portrait of a woman determined to survive. Claire Kendal’s extraordinary debut will haunt readers long after it reaches its terrifying, breathtaking conclusion.",0062297600,9780062297600),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","The third installment in the Old Filth trilogy, Last Friends will surprise and delight Gardam fans and appeal to new readers as it concludes a portrait of a marriage equal to any in the English language.Of Edward Feathers, a.k.a. Old Filth, the New York Times wrote, “he belongs in the Dickensian pantheon of memorable characters.” Filth, which stands for Failed in London Try Hong Kong, is a successful barrister who has spent most of his career practicing law in Southeast Asia. He met his wife, Betty, after she was released from an internment camp at the close of World War II. The first two books in this series—Old Filth and The Man in the Wooden Hat— told the story of their life together first from Edward's perspective, and then from Betty's. Last Friends is Edward's longtime nemesis and Betty's sometime lover, Terry Veneering's turn and with its telling a magnificent and deeply moving story comes to its satisfying final pages.As the Washington Post commented, these “absolutely wonderful” books give us “an astute, subtle depiction of marriage.” With this third revealing view of Betty and Edward's life together the depiction is completed as readers renew their connection to this remarkable, unforgettable couple.",1609450930,9781609450939),Paperback,,205 pages,"

Then a young man is killed in a freak motorcycle accident and a suicide note is found among his belongings. When a second boy is found dead shortly thereafter, the nightmare of repeat suicides once again threatens the community.        Desperate for a vacation, Detective Inspector Lorraine Fisher has just come to Radcote for a stay with her sister, Jo, but the atmosphere of the country house is unusually tense. Freddie, Jo's son, seems troubled and uncommunicative, and Jo is struggling to reach out to him. Meanwhile, Lorraine becomes determined to discover the truth behind these deaths. Are they suicides, or is there something more sinister at work? Finding answers might help Freddie, but they'll also lead to a shocking truth: whatever it is--or whoever it is--that's killing these young people is far more disturbing than she ever could have imagined, and unraveling the secret is just as dangerous as the secret itself.       Wicked, intense, and utterly compulsive, What You Left Behind confirms Samantha Hayes as a top thriller writer.",0804136920,9780804136921),Hardcover,,309 pages,"

","""Jason Goodwin has unleashed his talent on a series of mysteries set in nineteenth-century Istanbul and starring the unlikeliest and most engaging of detectives: Yashim the eunuch."" The Janissary Tree is the first in the series, and the year is 1836. Europe is modernizing, and the sultan of the Ottoman Empire feels he has no choice but to follow suit. But just as he's poised to announce sweeping political change, a wave of murders threatens the fragile balance of power in his court. Who is behind the killings? Deep in the Abode of Felicity, the most forbidden district of Topkapi Palace, the sultan - ruler of the Black Sea and the White, ruler of Rumelia and Mingrelia, lord of Anatolia and Ionia, Romania and Macedonia, Protector of the Holy Cities, steely rider through the realms of bliss - announces, ""Send for Yashim."" Leading us through the palace's luxurious seraglios and Istanbul's teeming streets, Yashim places together the clues. He is not alone. He depends on the wisdom of a dyspeptic Polish ambassador, a transsexual dancer, and the Creole-born queen mother. He manages to find sweet salvation in the arms of another man's wife (this is not your everyday eunuch!). And he introduces us to the Janissaries. For four hundred years, they were the empire's elite soldiers. But they grew too powerful, and ten years earlier the sultan had them crushed. Are the Janissaries staging a brutal comeback? And if they are, how can they be stopped without throwing Istanbul into political chaos?",0312426135,9780312426132),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","We all know love matters, but in this groundbreaking book positive emotions expert Barbara Fredrickson shows us how much. Even more than happiness and optimism, love holds the key to improving our mental and physical health as well as lengthening our lives. Using research from her own lab, Fredrickson redefines love not as a stable behemoth, but as micro-moments of connection between people—even strangers. She demonstrates that our capacity for experiencing love can be measured and strengthened in ways that improve our health and longevity. Finally, she introduces us to informal and formal practices to unlock love in our lives, generate compassion, and even self-soothe. Rare in its scope and ambitious in its message, Love 2.0 will reinvent how you look at and experience our most powerful emotion.",1594630992,9781594630996),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","What would happen if two statistics-minded outsiders were allowed to run a professional baseball team?It's the ultimate in fantasy baseball: You get to pick the roster, set the lineup, and decide on strategies -- with real players, in a real ballpark, playing in real time. That's what Ben Lindbergh and Sam Miller got to do when the Sonoma Stompers, an independent minor-league team in California, offered them the chance to run the team's baseball operations according to the most advanced statistics. The Only Rule Is It Has to Work is unlike any other baseball tale you've ever read.We tag along as Lindbergh and Miller apply their number-crunching insights to all aspects of assembling and running a team. We meet colorful figures like general manager Theo Fightmaster and boundary-breakers like the first openly gay professional player and the first Japanese manager in American professional baseball. Even José Canseco makes a cameo appearance.Will sabermetrics bring the Stompers a championship, or will they fall on their face? Will the team have a competitive advantage or is the old folk wisdom really true after all? Will the players be able to maximize their talents and attract the attention of big-league scouts, or will this be a fast track to oblivion?It's a wild ride, as the authors' infectious enthusiasm and feel for the absurd make the Stompers' story one that will speak to numbers geeks and traditionalists alike. And it proves that you don't need a bat or a glove to make a genuine contribution to the game.",1627795642,9781627795647),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","“Tell anyone who asks that you’re half-black and half-white, just like David Hasselhoff from Knight Rider.”–Angela’s mother“Love has no color,” insist Angela Nissel’s parents, but does it have a clue? In this candid, funny, and poignant memoir, Angela recounts growing up biracial in Philadelphia–moving back and forth between black inner-city schools and white prep schools–where her racial ambiguity and doomed attempts to blend in dog her teen years. Once in college, Angela experiments with black activism (hoping to find clarity in extremism), capitalizes on her “exotic” look at a strip club, and ends up with a major case of the blues (aka, a racial identity problem). Yet Angela is never down for the count. After moving to Los Angeles, she discovers that being multiracial is anything but simple, especially in terms of dating and romance.By turns a comedy of errors and a moving coming-of-age chronicle, Mixed traces one woman’s unforgettable journey to self-acceptance and belonging.Praise for Mixed“I love Angela Nissel's writing. Reading Mixed was like getting a letter from a best friend I forgot I had. How ironic that a book written by someone who felt like no one ""got"" her will surely be one of those rare books everyone gets- black, white, both, neither. Hilarious, sweet, and honest, Mixed is the perfect read if you've ever felt like the one standing on the outside-- and let's face it, who hasn't? - -Jill Soloway, author of Tiny Ladies in Shiny Pants“Nissel is humorous, poignant, and proud yet also empathetic and generous as she recounts her constant struggle to answer the perennial question persons of mixed race seem required to ask of themselves in our society–where do I fit in?.... All readers stand to learn from her account.” — Booklist“Colorful anecdotes, marvelous dialogue and a thoughtful narrative make this memoir a delight.”–Kirkus Reviews (starred review)""If David Sedaris was a straight biracial female, this is the book he'd write. This book is so funny I've already started telling people I helped Angela write it."" -- Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs""Growing up black and white, I always felt I had the best of both worlds. I feel the same way about Mixed. It's the perfect blend of hilarious comedy and sometimes tragic reality."" -- Yvette Lee Bowser, creator of Living Single and executive producer of Half and Half""Mixed is a hilarious must-read for anyone searching for the enchanting path to self-discovery. Angela Nissel's precise account of living the mixed race experience not only hit home with me, but the journey is deliciously enlightening and heart-rending at the same time. It's a journey well worth taking."" --Halle Berry",,,Kindle Edition,,242 pages,"

","In the first novel of a spellbinding new trilogy, New York Times bestselling author Jeff Shaara returns to the Civil War terrain he knows best. A Blaze of Glory takes us to the action-packed Western Theater for a vivid re-creation of one of the war’s bloodiest and most iconic engagements—the Battle of Shiloh.  It’s the spring of 1862. The Confederate Army in the West teeters on the brink of collapse following the catastrophic loss of Fort Donelson. Commanding general Albert Sidney Johnston is forced to pull up stakes, abandon the critical city of Nashville, and rally his troops in defense of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. Hot on Johnston’s trail are two of the Union’s best generals: the relentless Ulysses Grant, fresh off his career-making victory at Fort Donelson, and Don Carlos Buell. If their combined forces can crush Johnston’s army and capture the railroad, the war in the West likely will be over. There’s just one problem: Johnston knows of the Union plans, and is poised to launch an audacious surprise attack on Grant’s encampment—a small settlement in southwestern Tennessee anchored by a humble church named Shiloh.  With stunning you-are-there immediacy, Shaara takes us inside the maelstrom of Shiloh as no novelist has before. Drawing on meticulous research, he dramatizes the key actions and decisions of the commanders on both sides: Johnston, Grant, Sherman, Beauregard, and the illustrious Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest. Here too are the thoughts and voices of the junior officers, conscripts, and enlisted men who gave their all for the cause, among them Confederate cavalry lieutenant James Seeley and Private Fritz “Dutchie” Bauer of the 16th Wisconsin Regiment—brave participants in a pitched back-and-forth battle whose casualty count would far surpass anything the American public had yet seen in this war. By the end of the first day of fighting, as Grant’s bedraggled forces regroup for could be their last stand, two major events—both totally unexpected—will turn the tide of the battle and perhaps the war itself.",0345527356,9780345527356),Hardcover,,435 pages,"

","The Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery is Henri Nouwen's journal of his seven-month stay in the Abbey of the Genesee in upstate New York. His reflections on daily life with the Trappists are funny, wise, and often profound--resembling Kathleen Norris's The Cloister Walk, but a bit less thematically structured and more down to earth. Nouwen's goal is simply to record what it's like to pass the time in a cloistered community. He spends part of his stay there reading Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, which helps awaken a hunger for a richer experience of life that he subsequently satisfies by learning to slow down. In his first week at the monastery, Nouwen writes, ""I have so many ideas I want to write about, so many books I want to read, so many skills I want to learn--motorcycle maintenance is now one of them--and so many things I want to say to others now or later, that I do not SEE that God is all around me and that I am always trying to see what is ahead, overlooking him who is so close."" Then, looking forward to being planted in one place among the Trappists, he writes, ""Maybe I need to get stuck,"" to learn to see God. He does, and he does. --Michael Joseph Gross",0232521433,9780232521436),Paperback,,222 pages,"

After working with the bestselling crime writer for years, she’s intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus Pünd, who solves mysteries disturbing sleepy English villages. An homage to queens of classic British crime such as Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers, Alan’s traditional formula has proved hugely successful. So successful that Susan must continue to put up with his troubling behavior if she wants to keep her job.Conway’s latest tale has Atticus Pünd investigating a murder at Pye Hall, a local manor house. Yes, there are dead bodies and a host of intriguing suspects, but the more Susan reads, the more she’s convinced that there is another story hidden in the pages of the manuscript: one of real-life jealousy, greed, ruthless ambition, and murder.",1409158365,9781409158363),Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","Born to an unfortunate heritage, orphaned, unsympathetically raised, and then abandoned, Edgar Allan Poe struggled for greatness in an adverse social and economic climate -- a setting not improved by his fiery temperament and caustic criticism of others. Poe's melancholy brilliance, his passionate lyricism, and his tormented soul would make him one of the most widely read and original writers in American literature. Here, in one volume, are his classic short works: masterpieces of horror, terror, humor, and adventure -- and the finest lyric and narrative poetry of this ill-fated genius whose influence on both prose and verse continues to this day.  Pocket Books' Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of Great Tales And Poems Of Edgar Allan Poe contains the original Pocket Books introduction, first published in 1951, along with an updated selection of critical excerpts, and suggestions for further readings.",0743467469,9780743467469),Paperback,,457 pages,"

","""Não há inocentes. Apenas diferentes graus de responsabilidade"", raciocina Lisbeth Salander, protagonista de A menina que brincava com fogo, de Stieg Larsson. O autor - um jornalista sueco especializado em desmascarar organizações de extrema direita em seu país - morreu sem presenciar o sucesso de sua premiada saga policial, que, somente na Europa, já vendeu mais de 6,5 milhões de exemplares. Nada é o que parece ser nas histórias de Larsson. A própria Lisbeth parece uma garota frágil, mas é uma mulher determinada, ardilosa, perita tanto nas artimanhas da ciberpirataria quanto nas táticas do pugilismo, que sabe atacar com precisão quando se vê acuada. Mikael Blomkvist pode parecer apenas um jornalista em busca de um furo, mas no fundo é um investigador obstinado em desenterrar os crimes obscuros da sociedade sueca, sejam os cometidos por repórteres sensacionalistas, sejam os praticados por magistrados corruptos ou ainda aqueles perpetrados por lobos em pele de cordeiro. Um destes, o tutor de Lisbeth, foi morto a tiros. Na mesma noite, contudo, dois cordeiros também foram assassinados: um jornalista e uma criminologista que estavam prestes a denunciar uma rede de tráfico de mulheres. A arma usada nos crimes - um Colt 45 Magnum - não só foi a mesma como nela foram encontradas as impressões digitais de Lisbeth. Procurada por triplo homicídio, a moça desaparece. Mikael sabe que ela apenas está esperando o momento certo para provar que não é culpada e fazer justiça - a seu modo. Mas ele também sabe que precisa encontrá-la o mais rapidamente possível, pois mesmo uma jovem tão talentosa pode deparar-se com inimigos muito mais formidáveis - e que, se a polícia ou os bandidos a acharem primeiro, o resultado pode ser funesto, para ambos os lados. A menina que brincava com fogo segue as regras clássicas dos melhores thrillers, aplicando-as a elementos contemporâneos, como as novas tecnologias e os ícones da cultura pop. O resultado é um romance ao mesmo tempo movimentado e sangrento, intrigante e impossível de ser deixado de lado.",8535926178,9788535926170),Paperback,,608 pages,"

Kjell Westö todistaa olevansa ihmiskuvaajana omaa luokkaansa. Hän liikkuu sujuvasti työläisten hellahuoneissa ja rikkaiden salongeissa, Vallilan kapakoissa ja kesäisen Hangon tenniskentillä, punaisten valtaamassa pääkaupungissa ja ylhäisön illallisilla.

","The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is David S. Landes's acclaimed, best-selling exploration of one of the most contentious and hotly debated questions of our time: Why do some nations achieve economic success while others remain mired in poverty? The answer, as Landes definitively illustrates, is a complex interplay of cultural mores and historical circumstance. Rich with anecdotal evidence, piercing analysis, and a truly astonishing range of erudition, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations is a ""picture of enormous sweep and brilliant insight"" (Kenneth Arrow) as well as one of the most audaciously ambitious works of history in decades.For the paperback edition, Landes has written a new epilogue, in which he takes account of Asian financial crisises and the international tension between overconfidence and reality.",0393318885,9780393318883),Paperback,,531 pages,"

The family house is in the small Far West town of Fingerbone set on a glacial lake, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck, and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town ""chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere.""

","With Foreword by Fr. Frank Pavone. Abortion harms women. Bad products are recalled every day: the Ford Pinto, faulty tires, dangerous prescription pills, contaminated lettuce. If a product is found to pose even a modest risk to those who use it, you can bet it will soon be pulled from the market. . . . Unless that product is abortion. Every abortion kills an unborn child. But more, abortion harms women risking the health and well-being of those who all too often are conned or coerced into making this terrible choice. If it were any other product, abortion would have been removed from the market long ago. In 
 Recall Abortion
, author Janet Morana exposes the myriad ways abortion exploits women, and calls for a national recall of this deadly procedure. She documents the way abortion risks and degrades women's health. And she exposes the false promises and lies by which it is pushed and sold. Morana also investigates abortion's debilitating after-effects, and gives a voice to those women who have chosen abortion and have regretted it. These testimonies (so often silenced by the abortion industry) are a powerful and sometimes heartbreaking glimpse into the real suffering abortion causes, including deep depression and lasting physical and emotional scars. Abortion does not empower women. It is not health care. It harms women, severely. Isn't it time we  Recall Abortion?",1618901273,9781618901279),Hardcover,,232 pages,"

","The Enchanted Castle, a children's fantasy novel by Edith Nesbit was first published in 1907. The enchanted castle of the title is a country estate in the West Country seen through the eyes of three children, Gerald, James and Kathleen, who discover it while exploring during the school holidays. The lake, groves and marble statues, with white towers and turrets in the distance, make a fairy-tale setting, and then in the middle of the maze in the rose garden they find a sleeping fairy-tale princess. The ""princess"" tells them that the castle is full of magic, and they almost believe her. She shows them the treasures of the castle, including a magic ring she says is a ring of invisibility, but when it actually turns her invisible she panics and admits that she is the housekeeper's niece, Mabel, and was just play-acting. The children soon discover that the ring has other magical powers. The Enchanted Castle was written for both children and adults. It combines descriptions of the imaginative play of children, reminiscent of The Story of the Treasure Seekers, with a magic more muted than in her major fantasies such as The Story of the Amulet.",1539949338,9781539949336),Paperback,,158 pages,"

","Au XVIIIe siècle vécut en France un homme qui compta parmi les personnages les plus géniaux et les plus horribles de son époque. Il s'appelait Jean-Baptiste Grenouille. Sa naissance, son enfance furent épouvantables et tout autre qui lui n'aurait pas survécu. Mais Grenouille n'avait besoin que d'un minimum de nourriture et de vêtements et son âme n'avait besoin de rien.

Only Kestrel Hath, daughter of Ira and Hanno Hath, escapes the armies and rescues the silver voice from the burnt wind singer. Following the instinctive call of her twin brother Bowman across the desert, Kestrel meets Sisi, the spoilt Johdila engaged by her parents to Marius Ortiz. Kestrel becomes Sisi's closest friend and begins to open her eyes to another world. Bowman, who has been training his mind to move objects, has also caught the attention of Marius and has been engaged as his 'truth teller'. Their friend Mumpo has been perfecting the art of the killing dance of the Mastery, the manaxa, and finally kills the city's champion. In a whirlwind climax, Bowman comes face to face with the Master himself and the terrifying Morah is once again unleashed.

","Mistborn: Secret History is a companion story to the original Mistborn trilogy. As such, it contains HUGE SPOILERS for the books Mistborn (The Final Empire), The Well of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. It also contains very minor spoilers for the book The Bands of Mourning. Mistborn: Secret History builds upon the characterization, events, and worldbuilding of the original trilogy. Reading it without that background will be a confusing process at best. In short, this isn’t the place to start your journey into Mistborn. (Though if you have read the trilogy—but it has been a while—you should be just fine, so long as you remember the characters and the general plot of the books.) Saying anything more here risks revealing too much. Even knowledge of this story’s existence is, in a way, a spoiler. There’s always another secret.",,,Kindle Edition,,160 pages,"

 bestselling author Alexa Riley's first full-length novel shows just what happens when a strong, possessive man finds the woman of his dreams.
 

I'll never forget the way she looked, so confident and sure of herself. I watched her from a distance. She wasn't ready for me yet. I didn't approach her and I didn't disturb her, but I never once took my eyes off her. 
 
Mallory Sullivan is ready to start her new life. After graduating at the top of her class, she's landed one of the most coveted internships in the United States. Hard work and determination have gotten her to this moment of living the life she only dreamed of while growing up in foster care. 
From the start, I knew that she would be my greatest achievement, so the day I let her go, I set down a path for her. A path to me. 
 
She never expected Oz to be the greatest culmination of those dreams. But sometimes fate determines who you fall in love with. Who makes you lose control. Who owns your soul. And then you realize it wasn't fate at all… 
I've wanted to care for and protect her since the first moment I saw her. I've constructed everything in our lives so that at the perfect moment, I could have her, could give her the life she deserves.
 

The time has come.

A mysterious vamp with a particularly dangerous (and sexy) stare keeps popping unexpectedly into her life. The extremely powerful head vampire of New York is hunting her down because she may or may not have broken into his highly-secure, highly-secretive personal vault. And the fate she's been trying to outrun? Well, it's about to catch up. Because even a super-speedy vamp with the ability to disappear can't escape her own destiny.A brand new spinoff to the Midnight Fire series!

The answer: creating high-quality, stable jobs.And in today’s marketplace, “jobs” are in high demand — and so are the skills and the innovation and vision of entrepreneurs.In a world of high unemployment and an economy that needs new jobs to recover, who isn’t hungry for a solution, something that will speed economic recovery? Many look to the government, but it’s becoming more and more obvious that governments can’t create real jobs.

","Six months after her husband's sudden death, Leonora Galloway sets off for a holiday in Paris with her daughter Penelope. At last the time has come when secrets can be shared and explanations begin... Their journey starts with an unscheduled stop at the imposing Thiepval Memorial to the dead of the Battle of the Somme near Amiens. Amongst those commemorated is Leonora's father. The date of his death is recorded as 30th April, 1916. But Leonora wasn't born until 14th March 1917. Penelope at once supposes a simple wartime illegitimacy as the clue to her mother's unhappy childhood and the family's sundered connections with her aristocratic heritage, about which she has always known so little. But nothing could have prepared her, or the reader, for the extraordinary story that is about to unfold.",0552132810,9780552132817),Paperback,,393 pages,"

","Designado Mejor Libro del Año 2008 por el periódico The New York Times, Tierra desacostumbrada fue objeto de un torrente de admiración por parte de la crítica estadounidense. Además, algo inaudito para una obra literaria, logró colocarse en el primer lugar de las listas de ventas y suma hasta la fecha más de 680 mil ejemplares vendidos en ese país. Se trata, sin duda, de un caso único en el panorama editorial reciente. Quizás el secreto esté en que los relatos de Lahiri —que suelen girar en torno a las vivencias de las familias de ascendencia bengalí en Estados Unidos— no se detienen meramente en plasmar la experiencia de la inmigración, sino que retratan con gran fidelidad y sin cortapisas las vivencias y emociones que ocupan y preocupan a un amplio sector de la sociedad moderna. Son historias acerca de una variada galería de personajes caracterizados con singular delicadeza y simpatía: hermanos y hermanas, padres e hijos, maridos y mujeres, amigos y amantes que se ven obligados a afrontar momentos fundamentales en sus relaciones y navegar como pueden en aguas desconocidas, entre la inocencia y la experiencia, entre los dictados de la remota tradición familiar y la emancipación personal, entre el impulso de reinventarse a sí mismos y definir su identidad en un mundo fragmentado. Así pues, no cabe duda de que estamos ante una verdadera muestra de gran literatura. Tierra desacostumbrada es un libro que deslumbra y conmueve, y que reafirma, si cabe, la extraordinaria maestría de Jhumpa Lahiri, una autora en la plenitud de sus facultades artísticas.",8498382718,9788498382716),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Get in on Christy's Senior YearThe last three books, collected in one page-turning volume, conclude the bestselling Christy Miller series with hope and promise! At the start of her senior year, Christy looks forward to growing closer to Todd, but her friendship with Katie is on the rocks, threatening the year she was certain would be A Time to Cherish. With Sweet Dreams comes the start of a romantic summer. She'd be entirely swept off her feet if it wasn't for the most difficult decision she's ever had to make. And in A Promise Is Forever, Christy discovers foreign adventure is just her cup of tea. Follow Christy Miller as she stays true to her identity in Christ, drawing closer to God for help in realizing her dreams and dealing with her disappointments.Whether you're meeting her for the first time or have known her for years-- Christy Is a Forever FriendA Time to Cherish For Labor Day weekend, Christy Miller is on a houseboat at Lake Shasta. What could be better? She's about to find out! Before they know it, both Christy and her best friend, Katie, are receiving some unexpected male attention. But somehow these best friends are at odds just when they should be having the most fun together. Christy soon realizes that sometimes you have to stand back and let people make their own decisions, even when they're headed for a fall. And although life is never perfect, this is definitely a time to cherish.Sweet Dreams Christy Miller's senior year is delicious, especially the time she spends with Todd. But her best friend, Katie, is struggling--she's realized she needs to break up with Michael. It's not easy! Fortunately both Doug and Disneyland help Katie to cheer up. Christy is learning to let go and get out of the way so that her friends can become who they're meant to be...even when it jeopardizes her own sweet dreams.A Promise Is Forever Christy Miller's going to Europe! It's a three-week missions trip with Doug, Katie, and Tracy. First stop: London for some sightseeing, and then a castle in the English countryside for group training. Christy is so excited to be headed for Belfast with her friends--despite some tension among them. But when plans go topsy-turvy at the last minute, Christy must face her fears and realize that some things are more important than her own comfort...and that even when she can't foresee the end result, a promise truly is forever.Story Behind the Book""The Christy Miller series was actually born when a group of thirteen-year-olds challenged me to write a novel. I'd been questioning the content of their favorite books when they said, 'Why don't you write a book for us?' I told them no, I only wrote picture books. But they persisted: 'How hard could it be? We'll even tell you what to write! We want a love story with teenagers at the beach.' And there you go. Summer Promise first released seventeen years ago and is now translated into five languages. I continue to hear from readers all over the world, many girls saying that they gave their life to Christ after reading Summer Promise . I love that!"" --Robin Jones Gunn",1590525876,9781590525876),Hardcover,,493 pages,"

","Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says outstanding companies can do everything right and still lose their market leadership -- or worse, disappear completely. And he not only proves what he says, he tells others how to avoid a similar fate.Focusing on ""disruptive technology"" -- the Honda Super Cub, Intel's 8088 processor, or the hydraulic excavator, for example -- Christensen shows why most companies miss ""the next great wave."" Whether in electronics or retailing, a successful company with established products will get pushed aside unless managers know when to abandon traditional business practices. Using the lessons of successes and failures from leading companies, ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" presents a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.",0060521996,9780060521998),Paperback,,286 pages,"

Apa artinya memiliki anak, merawat kehidupan baru saat kehidupan lain meredup? Inilah beberapa pertanyaan yang Kalanithi hadapi dalam memoar yang menyentuh dan indah ini. Di usia tiga puluh enam tahun, di akhir masa pelatihannya selama sepuluh tahun sebagai seorang ahli bedah saraf, Paul Kalanithi didiagnosis mengidap kanker paru-paru stadium IV.

Detailed personal data about all U.S. residents is stored in a registered, highly secured database controlled by an enigmatic government agency. The governmental grip tightens with new laws requiring standardized state documents that comply with federal guidelines. And this is only the beginning. Following exhaustive and flawless testing of the fledgling National Identification System, the government forces the issue of microprocessor implants for verification purposes. Every person in the United States of America will be implanted with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip to authenticate identity and store personal information. Yet, one question remains unanswered: Is identity verification the only reason for signifying everyone with the Mark of the Beast? The evening before the National Identification System officially becomes a reality, during the last control tests of the system, something goes wrong: Someone accidentally discovers the real purpose of the implants.

","Podróż do kresu nocy"" (1932) to debiut Louisa-Ferdinanda Céline'a (1894-1961), uznawanego za jednego z największych pisarzy francuskich. Oparta na wątkach autobiograficznych powieść wywołała duże zainteresowanie krytyki i czytelników. Sukces wynikał z zastosowania przez autora zupełnie nowego i rewolucyjnego języka. Céline odwołuje się do języka mówionego, do argot, do wszelkiego rodzaju kolokwializmów. W niezwykle brutalnej, prowokacyjnej i niejednokrotnie szokującej formie przedstawia opis współczesności, którą można oddać jedynie poprzez krzyk i bunt.",,,Paperback,,560 pages,"

","IntroductionA Far Cry from SunsetIn the summer of 2005, three friends and I took an eight month journey across the two continents of America and Europe.We were on a mission: – to get ten of the world’s most famous recording artists to record a tribute album to an unknown songwriter; – And that songwriter would be me.And as we travelled we were going to make a road movie; an epic chronicle of our quest, and a testament to our friendship.We made it and we called it, Tribute This!The adventures we had and the people we met changed my life profoundly. Not only its present but also how I viewed its past.Apart from our struggles with managers, publicists, security and even one or two of the artists themselves, we ran into so many people from ordinary walks of life; cab drivers, hotel porters, fans standing in line to see their heroes, who couldn’t do enough to help or encourage us on our journey.For one long summer, we lived life so brilliantly; so full of laughter and a gathering sense of achievement that I wondered if the artists we were pursuing ever got to see life in anything like the same way.In contrast they seemed so protected, so hidden away, so cut off from the world that, towards the end of our travels, the thought occurred to me that, at that point in time, I wouldn’t swap one year of their lives for one day of ours.My hope is that, in reading my account of those heady days, you will understand why.Billy Franks",1479340901,9781479340903),Paperback,First Edition,196 pages,"

","The action of this play takes place in late August 1833 at a hedge-school in the townland of Baile Beag - an Irish speaking community in County Donegal. The 'scholars' are a cross-section of the local community, from a semi-literate young farmer to and elderly polygot autodidact who reads and quotes Homer in the orginal. In a nearby field camps a recently arrived detachment of the Royal Engineers, engaged on behalf of the Britsh Army and Government in making the first Ordnance Survey. For the purposes ofr cartography, the local Gaelic place names have to be recorded and transliterated - or translated - into English, in examining the effects of this operation on the lives of a small group of people, Irish and English, Brian Friel skillfully reveals the unexperctedly far-reaching personal and cultural effects of an action which is at first sight purely administrative and harmless. While remaining faithful to the personalities and relationshiops of those people at that time he makes a richly suggestive statement about Irish - and English - history.",0571117422,9780571117420),Paperback,,91 pages,"

","In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.The Giver is set in a future society which is at first presented as a utopia and gradually appears more and more dystopic, so could therefore be considered anti-utopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. Jonas' society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness"", a plan which has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of ""Receiver of Memory,"" the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. As Jonas receives the memories from his predecessor—the ""Giver""—he discovers how shallow his community's life has become.",,,Mass Market Paperback,,179 pages,"

","An acclaimed Turkish novelist's personal account of balancing a writer's life with a mother's life.   After the birth of her first child in 2006, Turkish writer Elif Shafek suffered from postpartum depression that triggered a profound personal crisis. Infused with guilt, anxiety, and bewilderment about whether she could ever be a good mother, Shafak stopped writing and lost her faith in words altogether. In this elegantly written memoir, she retraces her journey from free-spirited, nomadic artist to dedicated but emotionally wrought mother. Identifying a constantly bickering harem of women who live inside of her, each with her own characteristics--the cynical intellectual, the goal-oriented go-getter, the practical-rational, the spiritual, the maternal, and the lustful--she craves harmony, or at least a unifying identity. As she intersperses her own experience with the lives of prominent authors such as Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf, Alice Walker, Ayn Rand, and Zelda Fitzgerald, Shafak looks for a solution to the inherent conflict between artistic creation and responsible parenting.  With searing emotional honesty and an incisive examination of cultural mores within patriarchal societies, Shafak has rendered an important work about literature, motherhood, and spiritual well-being.",0670022640,9780670022649),Hardcover,,267 pages,"

","Based on the immensely popular six-part BBC program that will air in the United States during the fall of 1995, this book offers what writer/filmmaker David Attenborough is best known for delivering: an intimate view of the natural world wherein a multitude of miniature dramas unfold. In the program and book, both titled The Private Life of Plants, Attenborough treks through rainforests, mountain ranges, deserts, beaches, and home gardens to show us things we might never have suspected about the vegetation that surrounds us. With their extraordinary sensibility, plants compete endlessly for survival and interact with animals and insects: they can see, count, communicate, adjust position, strike, and capture. Attenborough makes the plant world a vivid place for readers, who in this book can enjoy the tour at their own pace, taking in the lively descriptions and nearly 300 full-color photos showing plants in close detail.The author reveals to us the aspects of plants' lives that seem hidden from view, such as fighting, avoiding or exploiting predators or neighbors, and struggling to find food, increase their territories, reproduce themselves, and establish their place in the sun. Among the most amazing examples, the acacia can communicate with other acacias and repel enemies that might eat their leaves, the orchid can impersonate female wasps to attract males and ensure the spreading of its pollen, the Venus's flytrap can take other organisms captive and consume them. Covering this remarkable range of information with enthusiasm and clarity, Attenborough helps us to look anew at the vegetation on which all life depends and which has an intriguing life of its own. He has created a booksure to please the plant lover and any other reader interested in exploring the natural world.",0691006393,9780691006390),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","A chilling thriller that brilliantly blends domestic drama, psychological suspense, and a touch of modern horror, reminiscent of Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves, John Ajvide Lindqvist’s Let the Right One In, and Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House.The lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when fourteen-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.To her parents’ despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie’s descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts’ plight. With John, Marjorie’s father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed, and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie’s younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface—and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.",,,Kindle Edition,,309 pages,"

Reduced to a life of exile in rural southern Ontario—accompanied only by his fantasy daughter, Miranda, who died twelve years ago—Felix devises a plan for retribution.Eventually he takes a job teaching Literacy Through Theatre to the prisoners at the nearby Burgess Correctional Institution, and is making a modest success of it when an auspicious star places his enemies within his reach. With the help of their own interpretations, digital effects, and the talents of a professional actress and choreographer, the Burgess Correctional Players prepare to video their Tempest. Not surprisingly, they view Caliban as the character with whom they have the most in common. However, Felix has another twist in mind, and his enemies are about to find themselves taking part in an interactive and illusion-ridden version of The Tempest that will change their lives forever. But how will Felix deal with his invisible Miranda’s decision to take a part in the play?",0804141290,9780804141291),Hardcover,,301 pages,"

","From bestselling author Neal Stephenson and critically acclaimed historical and contemporary commercial novelist Nicole Galland comes a captivating and complex near-future thriller combining history, science, magic, mystery, intrigue, and adventure that questions the very foundations of the modern world.When Melisande Stokes, an expert in linguistics and languages, accidently meets military intelligence operator Tristan Lyons in a hallway at Harvard University, it is the beginning of a chain of events that will alter their lives and human history itself. The young man from a shadowy government entity approaches Mel, a low-level faculty member, with an incredible offer. The only condition: she must sign a nondisclosure agreement in return for the rather large sum of money.Tristan needs Mel to translate some very old documents, which, if authentic, are earth-shattering. They prove that magic actually existed and was practiced for centuries. But the arrival of the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment weakened its power and endangered its practitioners. Magic stopped working altogether in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition at London’s Crystal Palace—the world’s fair celebrating the rise of industrial technology and commerce. Something about the modern world ""jams"" the ""frequencies"" used by magic, and it’s up to Tristan to find out why.And so the Department of Diachronic Operations—D.O.D.O. —gets cracking on its real mission: to develop a device that can bring magic back, and send Diachronic Operatives back in time to keep it alive . . . and meddle with a little history at the same time. But while Tristan and his expanding operation master the science and build the technology, they overlook the mercurial—and treacherous—nature of the human heart.Written with the genius, complexity, and innovation that characterize all of Neal Stephenson’s work and steeped with the down-to-earth warmth and humor of Nicole Galland’s storytelling style, this exciting and vividly realized work of science fiction will make you believe in the impossible, and take you to places—and times—beyond imagining.",0008132569,9780008132569),Hardcover,,753 pages,"

","When a bookshop patron commits suicide, his favorite store clerk must unravel the puzzle he left behind. Lydia Smith lives her life hiding in plain sight. A clerk at the Bright Ideas bookstore, she keeps a meticulously crafted existence among her beloved books, eccentric colleagues, and the BookFrogs—the lost and lonely regulars who spend every day marauding the store’s overwhelmed shelves.  But when Joey Molina, a young, beguiling BookFrog, kills himself in the bookstore’s upper room, Lydia’s life comes unglued. Always Joey’s favorite bookseller, Lydia has been bequeathed his meager worldly possessions. Trinkets and books; the detritus of a lonely, uncared for man. But when Lydia flips through his books she finds them defaced in ways both disturbing and inexplicable. They reveal the psyche of a young man on the verge of an emotional reckoning. And they seem to contain a hidden message. What did Joey know? And what does it have to do with Lydia?  As Lydia untangles the mystery of Joey’s suicide, she unearths a long buried memory from her own violent childhood. Details from that one bloody night begin to circle back. Her distant father returns to the fold, along with an obsessive local cop, and the Hammerman, a murderer who came into Lydia’s life long ago and, as she soon discovers, never completely left.",1501116843,9781501116841),Hardcover,,328 pages,"

","The Conversations is a treasure, essential for any lover or student of film, and a rare, intimate glimpse into the worlds of two accomplished artists who share a great passion for film and storytelling, and whose knowledge and love of the crafts of writing and film shine through.It was on the set of the movie adaptation of his Booker Prize-winning novel, The English Patient, that Michael Ondaatje met the master film and sound editor Walter Murch, and the two began a remarkable personal conversation about the making of films and books in our time that continued over two years. From those conversations stemmed this enlightened, affectionate book -- a mine of wonderful, surprising observations and information about editing, writing and literature, music and sound, the I-Ching, dreams, art and history.The Conversations is filled with stories about how some of the most important movies of the last thirty years were made and about the people who brought them to the screen. It traces the artistic growth of Murch, as well as his friends and contemporaries -- including directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Fred Zinneman and Anthony Minghella -- from the creation of the independent, anti-Hollywood Zoetrope by a handful of brilliant, bearded young men to the recent triumph of Apocalypse Now Redux.Among the films Murch has worked on are American Graffiti, The Conversation, the remake of A Touch of Evil, Julia, Apocalypse Now, The Godfather (all three), The Talented Mr. Ripley, and The English Patient.""Walter Murch is a true oddity in Hollywood. A genuine intellectual and renaissance man who appears wise and private at the centre of various temporary storms to do with film making and his whole generation of filmmakers. He knows, probably, where a lot of the bodies are buried.""",0375709827,9780375709821),Paperback,,339 pages,"

","At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the ""gift"" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.",0064407055,9780064407052),Paperback,20th Anniversary Edition,232 pages,"

","Ian McEwan's Somerset Maugham Award-winning collection First Love, Last Rites brought him instant recognition as one of the most influential voices writing in England today. Taut, brooding, and densely atmospheric, these stories show us the ways in which murder can arise out of boredom, perversity can result from adolescent curiosity, and sheer evil might be the solution to unbearable loneliness. These tales are as horrifying as anything written by Clive Barker or Stephen King, but they are crafted with a lyricism and intensity that compel us to confront our secret kinship with the horrifying.",0679750193,9780679750192),Paperback,Reissue Edition,176 pages,"

Edith's story is remarkable not only for her own bravery, but for the bravery of those that helped her: an entire village, including its mayor and citizenry, heroically conspired to conceal the presence of hundreds of Jewish children who lived in the safe house. The children went to the local school, roamed the streets and ate good food, all withot having to worry about concealing their Jewish identity. And during Nazi raids, the children camped out until the coast was clear.  Intensively researched and sensitively written, this book, illustrated with photographs and maps, both comforts and challenges a young reader's spirit, skillfully addressing both the horrors and hope that children experienced during the Holocaust.",1897187068,9781897187067),Paperback,,152 pages,"

","Bestselling author of Warped Passages and Knocking on Heaven's Door and one of today's most influential and highly cited theoretical physicists, Professor Lisa Randall once again effortlessly delivers fascinating science to the general reader. Weaving together the cosmos' history and our own in an expanding intellectual adventure story, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs takes us from the mysteries of dark matter and our cosmic environment to the conditions for life on Earth.Sixty-six million years ago, an object the size of a city descended from space to crash into Earth, creating a cataclysm that killed off the dinosaurs, along with three-quarters of the other species on the planet. What was its origin? Randall proposes it was a comet that was dislodged from its orbit as the Solar System passed through a disk of dark matter that is embedded in the plane of the Milky Way. Her research challenges the usual assumptions about the simple nature of dark matter and demonstrates how scientists formulate and establish new ideas. In a sense, it might have been dark matter that killed the dinosaurs.With her unique and wide-ranging perspective, Randall connects dark matter to the history of the world in the broadest terms. Bringing in pop culture and social and political viewpoints, she shares with us the latest findings—established and speculative—regarding dark matter, the cosmos, the galaxy, asteroids, comets, and impacts, as well as life's development and extinctions. Randall makes clear how connected the planet is to the makeup of the Universe, but also how fragile our place in the Universe, which evolved over billions of years, might be.In this brilliant and fresh exploration of our cosmic environment, Professor Randall explains the underlying science of our world in the breathtaking tale of a Universe in which the small and the large, the visible and the hidden are intimately related. Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs illuminates the deep relationships that are critical to our world as well as the astonishing beauty of the structures and connections that surround us. It's impossible to read this book and look at either Earth or sky again in the same way.",0062328514,9780062328519),ebook,,432 pages,"

A feeling he never imagined. 

A revelation he never saw coming. 

A love that transcends time and space. 


With the arrival of 11th grade, Hamilton Dinger has no shortage of activities to pursue. With his job at the mayor’s office, schoolwork, and fighting off evil, he has no time to worry about Starry Knight’s recent betrayal and his relentless fixation with her.Even though he does anyway.Pushing past his emotional turmoil, he works with Aleia and Elysian to uncover the truth about the Seven Deadly Sinisters and his supernatural origins. When disaster strikes once more, Hamilton and his friends realize the only way to prevent chaos from taking over Apollo City, and eventually the world, is to find the answers to the questions hidden deep inside his heart and mind.

FROM THE BOOK: 

I looked at her, with her hand outstretched, and watched as the last of her power fizzled out and retreated inside of her. Her fist closed, and she straightened as she squarely met my gaze. 

""... I'm Starry Knight,"" she said, her words soft and light, even as they soundly struck me to the core.






FROM THE AUTHOR: 

Enjoy this book? Look for the next book in this epic fantasy series for young adults! Perfect for young teenagers or disaffected college students, or adults who enjoy some satire mixed in with some star-crossed lovers and high school drama! 


WHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING:

Previously published as Extreme Bachelor
Five years after a serial dater (and former CIA agent) breaks up with his actress girlfriend, they both end up working on the same movie set - and their bickering quickly rekindles their fiery passion. Behind Michael Raney's good looks lies a string of ex-girlfriends and a web of secrets. A former CIA agent, stunt coordinator, and one of the dashing, sexy members of Thrillseekers Anonymous, Michael earned the nickname Extreme Bachelor after dating and dumping countless women over the years. But there's one woman he can't forget: actress Leah Klein. Still devastated that Michael dumped her - especially since she thought a marriage proposal was on his lips - former Broadway star Leah almost faints when she sees him coordinating the stunts on the set of her first movie. This film was supposed to be her big break, not another heartbreak. The more Michael and Leah work together, the more they remember their sensual past. Could the Extreme Bachelor finally be willing to renounce his title? Or will the beautiful women of Hollywood - and the scandalous secrets of his past - steal him away from Leah again?",1477805826,9781477805824),Paperback,,410 pages,"

","Writing this book has been a joy. It is my gift to Christians living in these last days and to every individual who has been disappointed by organized religion yet has honest, heartfelt questions regarding God and his own spirituality. It's been said that Satan's greatest achievement is convincing individuals that he doesn't exist.

","In a ruined, nameless city of the future, a woman named Rachel, who makes her living as a scavenger, finds a creature she names “Borne” entangled in the fur of Mord, a gigantic, despotic bear. Mord once prowled the corridors of the biotech organization known as the Company, which lies at the outskirts of the city, until he was experimented on, grew large, learned to fly and broke free. Driven insane by his torture at the Company, Mord terrorizes the city even as he provides sustenance for scavengers like Rachel.At first, Borne looks like nothing at all—just a green lump that might be a Company discard. The Company, although severely damaged, is rumoured to still make creatures and send them to distant places that have not yet suffered Collapse.Borne somehow reminds Rachel of the island nation of her birth, now long lost to rising seas. She feels an attachment she resents; attachments are traps, and in this world any weakness can kill you. Yet when she takes Borne to her subterranean sanctuary, the Balcony Cliffs, Rachel convinces her lover, Wick, not to render Borne down to raw genetic material for the drugs he sells—she cannot break that bond.Wick is a special kind of supplier, because the drug dealers in the city don’t sell the usual things. They sell tiny creatures that can be swallowed or stuck in the ear, and that release powerful memories of other people’s happier times or pull out forgotten memories from the user’s own mind—or just produce beautiful visions that provide escape from the barren, craterous landscapes of the city.Against his better judgment, out of affection for Rachel or perhaps some other impulse, Wick respects her decision. Rachel, meanwhile, despite her loyalty to Wick, knows he has kept secrets from her. Searching his apartment, she finds a burnt, unreadable journal titled “Mord,” a cryptic reference to the Magician (a rival drug dealer) and evidence that Wick has planned the layout of the Balcony Cliffs to match the blueprint of the Company building. What is he hiding? Why won’t he tell her about what happened when he worked for the Company?",0374115249,9780374115241),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Isandor, City of Spires.A hundred and thirty years have passed since Arathiel last set foot in his home city. Isandor hasn’t changed—bickering merchant families still vie for power through eccentric shows of wealth—but he has. His family is long dead, a magical trap has dulled his senses, and he returns seeking a sense of belonging now long lost.Arathiel hides in the Lower City, piecing together a new life among in a shelter dedicated to the homeless and the poor, befriending an uncommon trio: the Shelter’s rageful owner, Larryn, his dark elven friend Hasryan, and Cal the cheese-loving halfling. When Hasryan is accused of Isandor's most infamous assassination of the last decade, what little peace Arathiel has managed to find for himself is shattered. Hasryan is innocent… he thinks. In order to save him, Arathiel may have to shatter the shreds of home he’d managed to build for himself.Arathiel could appeal to the Dathirii—a noble elven family who knew him before he disappeared—but he would have to stop hiding, and they have battles of their own to fight. The idealistic Lord Dathirii is waging a battle of honour and justice against the cruel Myrian Empire, objecting to their slavery, their magics, and inhumane treatment of their apprentices. One he could win, if only he could convince Isandor’s rulers to stop courting Myrian’s favours for profit.In the ripples that follow Diel’s opposition, friendships shatter and alliances crumble. Arathiel, the Dathirii, and everyone in Isandor fights to preserve their homes, even if the struggle changes them irrevocably.--------City of Strife is the first installment of the City of Spires trilogy, a multi-layered political fantasy led by an all LGBTQIAP+ cast.

And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.",,,Hardcover,,1336 pages,"

","Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It converts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes the skeptics and cynics into the believers and the undecided into the loyal. Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it's more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions. For instance, enchantment is what enabled . . .A Peace Corps volunteer to finesse a potentially violent confrontation with armed guerrillas.A small cable channel (E!) to win the TV broadcast rights to radio superstar Howard Stern.??A seemingly crazy new running shoe (Vibram Five Fingers) to methodically build a passionate customer base.??A Canadian crystal maker (Nova Scotian Crystal) to turn observers into buyers.This book explains all the tactics you need to prepare and launch an enchantment campaign; to get the most from both push and pull technologies; and to enchant your customers, your employees, and even your boss. It shows how enchantment can turn difficult decisions your way, at times when intangibles mean more than hard facts. It will help you overcome other people's entrenched habits and defy the not-always-wise ""wisdom of the crowd.""Kawasaki's lessons are drawn from his tenure at one of the most enchanting organizations of all time, Apple, as well as his decades of experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. There are few people in the world more qualified to teach you how to enchant people.As Kawasaki writes, ""Want to change the world? Change caterpillars into butterflies? This takes more than run-of-the-mill relationships. You need to convince people to dream the same dream that you do."" That's a big goal, but one that's possible for all of us.",1591843790,9781591843795),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

Ko se s pomočjo svojega rejniškega očeta nauči brati, knjige postanejo njena strast. Drugi kradejo hrano za preživetje, ona pa krade knjige, ki jih nato med bombnimi napadi deli z drugimi. Tako ona kot okoliški prebivalci se vse bolj spreminjajo, tako zaradi vsebine knjig kot tudi grozot, ki se dogajajo okrog njih.source: sanje.si",9616767909,9789616767903),Paperback,,542 pages,"

","Paris, near the turn of 1933. Three young friends meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse. They are Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and their friend Raymond Aron, who opens their eyes to a radical new way of thinking. Pointing to his drink, he says, 'You can make philosophy out of this cocktail!'From this moment of inspiration, Sartre will create his own extraordinary philosophy of real, experienced life–of love and desire, of freedom and being, of cafés and waiters, of friendships and revolutionary fervour. It is a philosophy that will enthral Paris and sweep through the world, leaving its mark on post-war liberation movements, from the student uprisings of 1968 to civil rights pioneers.At the Existentialist Café tells the story of modern existentialism as one of passionate encounters between people, minds and ideas. From the ‘king and queen of existentialism'–Sartre and de Beauvoir–to their wider circle of friends and adversaries including Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Iris Murdoch, this book is an enjoyable and original journey through a captivating intellectual movement. Weaving biography and thought, Sarah Bakewell takes us to the heart of a philosophy about life that also changed lives, and that tackled the biggest questions of all: what we are and how we are to live.",0701186585,9780701186586),Hardcover,,440 pages,"

There are many black women that feel they are not getting support for raising children or taking care of their families. Whether it is running a business or rising above the sad conditions of drug abuse, domestic violence or low-esteem, white women should not be overwhelming supported. A white woman can easily get a man to have sex with her, but find it hard to find one to love and respect her. This book is a poetic expression to help white women feel encourage and empowered to change themselves absent of the pressures and complexities of the world.",,,Kindle Edition,,41 pages,"

","This extraordinary play is loosely based on the famous Archer-Shee case, in which a young cadet, expelled from the Royal Naval College at Osborne on a charge of petty theft, was finally vindicated after the matter had become a public and Parliamentary scandal. This trial, stemming from an incident which in itself seemed relatively unimportant, soon developed into a spectacular and significant struggle on the outcome of which certain fundamental principles of democracy were at issue. A pleasant young English boy, on seemingly conclusive evidence, was discharged from an English government school. The boy's father, believing implicitly in the youth's denial of guilt, starts to investigate the procedure by which the lad was allegedly deprived of his rights as an individual. The father puts the case into the hands of an eminent lawyer who considers the issues involved just as important as does the plaintiff. During the years that the legal fight continues, the entire country is aroused over the principles involved, and the boy's family become impoverished and suffer acutely from a sort of social ostracism to which they all fall victims. The father's stand, in particular, assumes an almost fanatical character. At the end, however - because of his ultimate belief in justice and democratic ideals - his stand is triumphantly justified.",0582060192,9780582060197),Paperback,,184 pages,"

","Traditionally Hinduism has appealed to Western eyes though its rich tableau of visual artifacts: temple architecture, sculpture, painting, craft. Guy Beck argues, however, that the focus of Western scholars on Hinduism's visual component has often been at the expense of the religion's most important feature - its emphasis on sound. Beck addresses this longstanding imbalance in this pathbreaking study. He contends that sound possesses a central place in Hindu theory and practice and that Hinduism is essentially a sonic theology. Unlike religious traditions that emphasize silence, the Hindu world is permeated by sound. Drums, bells, gongs, cymbals, conches, flutes, and an array of vocalizations play a central role in the worship experience. Beck provides a theoretical exposition of the major textual sources of Hindu sacred sound, namely the Vedas, Upanishads, Mimamsa, Grammar, Yoga, Saiva-Agama, Sakta-Tantra, and Vaisnava Pancaratra. From the Vedic Vak as ""spoken word"" to the Sabda-Brahman of the Upanishads, Mimamsa, and Grammar, and on to the Nada-Brahman of Yoga, Saivism, Saktism, Vaisnavism, and Indian classical music, Beck argues that sound participates at every level of the Hindu cosmos. As he weaves the theology of sound throughout Hindu textual traditions, Beck provides ample, coherent justifications of the practical use of sound in Mantra repetitions, Om recitations, and Nada-Brahman meditational techniques. He compares the centrality of sound in Hindu theology to its role, or its absence, in other religions. The issues Beck raises about sound and language not only reshape our understanding of Hindu worship but also invite a fresh approach to comparative theology.",0872498557,9780872498556),Hardcover,,306 pages,"

Husbands and wives. Mothers and daughters. The past and the future. 

Secrets bind them. And secrets can destroy them. 
The author of Pretty Girls returns with an electrifying, emotionally complex thriller that plunges its fascinating protagonist into the darkest depths of a mystery that just might destroy him. With the discovery of a murder at an abandoned construction site, Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is brought in on a case that becomes much more dangerous when the dead man is identified as an ex-cop.Studying the body, Sara Linton—the GBI’s newest medical examiner and Will’s lover—realizes that the extensive blood loss didn't belong to the corpse. Sure enough, bloody footprints leading away from the scene indicate there is another victim—a woman—who has vanished . . . and who will die soon if she isn’t found.Will is already compromised, because the site belongs to the city’s most popular citizen: a wealthy, powerful, and politically connected athlete protected by the world’s most expensive lawyers—a man who’s already gotten away with rape, despite Will’s exhaustive efforts to put him away.But the worst is yet to come. Evidence soon links Will’s troubled past to the case . . . and the consequences will tear through his life with the force of a tornado, wreaking havoc for Will and everyone around him, including his colleagues, family, friends—and even the suspects he pursues.Relentlessly suspenseful and furiously paced, peopled with conflicted, fallible characters who leap from the page, The Kept Woman is a seamless blend of twisty police procedural and ingenious psychological thriller -- a searing, unforgettable novel of love, loss, and redemption.  ",0062430211,9780062430212),Hardcover,,461 pages,"

Allí, envuelto en una tierra vieja que está sobre las brasas de la tierra, «en la mera boca del infierno», se encontrará con las voces de la memoria de personajes de ensueño, que irán tejiendo una historia de deseos y pasado, de muertos y visiones irreales, que abarca desde mediados del XIX a las revueltas cristeras de comienzos del XX. Anclada en terreno firme, la novela se dispara en múltiples direcciones rompiendo el tiempo, confundiendo realidad y alucinación, fundiendo violencia y lirismo con sus conversaciones entrecortadas. Entre espectros, la desolación de Comala hace realidad ese «valle de lágrimas» que compone la geografía universal del dolor, llena de ecos, violencia y aire envenenado.",,,Kindle Edition,,115 pages,"

Before Sarah has come to terms with that loss, her merchant father grows frail and increasingly desperate in the face of impending bankruptcy. On the rainy night their father scours the docks of Bordeaux, France, to make his final bid to save his family, his children are kidnapped and forced onto a ship bound for New York City where they’ll be separated and sold to the highest bidder as indentured labor. Purchased by a grotesque merchant whose wealth, backed by a team of henchmen, allows him to dominate the chaotic East River docks, Sarah strikes back the only way she can. Vowing to never allow him to put his hands on her again, she presses a knife to his fat neck. She demands her freedom, a roof over her head and the means to start a business. Her leverage? Knowledge obtained on the voyage that would bring the big man to his knees forever. He yields to her demands but privately swears to become her worst nightmare.",0992120268,9780992120269),Paperback,,455 pages,"

","The endgame is at hand for Penn Cage, his family, and the enemies bent on destroying them in this revelatory volume in the epic trilogy set in modern-day Natchez, Mississippi—Greg Iles’s epic tale of love and honor, hatred and revenge that explores how the sins of the past continue to haunt the present.Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover. Most terrifying of all, Dr. Cage seems bent on self-destruction. Despite Penn's experience as a prosecutor in major murder trials, his father has frozen him out of the trial preparations--preferring to risk dying in prison to revealing the truth of the crime to his son. During forty years practicing medicine, Tom Cage made himself the most respected and beloved physician in Natchez, Mississippi. But this revered Southern figure has secrets known only to himself and a handful of others. Among them, Tom has a second son, the product of an 1960s affair with his devoted African American nurse, Viola Turner. It is Viola who has been murdered, and her bitter son--Penn's half-brother--who sets in motion the murder case against his father. The resulting investigation exhumes dangerous ghosts from Mississippi's violent past. In some way that Penn cannot fathom, Viola Turner was a nexus point between his father and the Double Eagles, a savage splinter cell of the KKK. More troubling still, the long-buried secrets shared by Dr. Cage and the former Klansmen may hold the key to the most devastating assassinations of the 1960s. The surviving Double Eagles will stop at nothing to keep their past crimes buried, and with the help of some of the most influential men in the state, they seek to ensure that Dr. Cage either takes the fall for them, or takes his secrets to an early grave. Unable to trust anyone around him--not even his own mother--Penn joins forces with Serenity Butler, a famous young black author who has come to Natchez to write about his father's case. Together, Penn and Serenity battle to crack the Double Eagles and discover the secret history of the Cage family and the South itself, a desperate move that risks the only thing they have left to gamble: their lives. Mississippi Blood is the enthralling conclusion to a breathtaking trilogy seven years in the making--one that has kept readers on the edge of their seats. With piercing insight, narrative prowess, and a masterful ability to blend history and imagination, Greg Iles illuminates the brutal history of the American South in a highly atmospheric and suspenseful novel that delivers the shocking resolution his fans have eagerly awaited.",0062642618,9780062642615),Paperback,,704 pages,"

"," Something dreadful is happening to women.   Not directly to all women but to a sufficient number to affect nearly all women and indeed society as a whole.  This dreadful thing — for it is to be dreaded — is self-destructiveness, that strange process by which humans sometimes damage or destroy themselves in body, mind or spirit.  So writes Dr Ann Dally — doctor, psychiatrist and author.  In  The Morbid Streak  she showed how self-destructiveness distorts our lives and poisons our relationships.  Here, she painfully and compassionately explores a paradox.  Women are beginning to throw off the bonds of the last centuries, but as they emerge, the very freedoms and open choices they achieve thrust them brutally into underachievement, tranquillizer-addiction, neurosis, breakdown and even suicide.  And in our modern society, self-destruction in these forms equals failure.  So women’s personalities and the pressures of the new society conspire to cheat women of their ambitions, their self-esteem and their emotions.   Why Women Fail  is a fascinating study that does not only analyse the tragedy of women's constriction in society, but also shows how we can all work to restructure the values of society and enable women to achieve self-fulfilment.    Praise for Ann Dally     'Thorough and engaging' -  Kirkus Reviews   'introduces a levelheaded view' -  Kirkus Reviews   'refreshingly evenhanded' -  Kirkus Reviews     Dr Ann Dally (1929-2007)  was a pioneering English author and psychiatrist. She was born in London, the daughter of a distinguished lawyer and a half-American mother. She studied history, before qualifying in medicine and then in psychiatry, whilst going on to marry and have six children. Ann Dally wrote eleven books in all, including  Women Under the Knife , about the history of gynaecological surgery,  A-Z of Babies, The Intelligent Person’s Guide to Modern Medicine, A Child is Born, Mothers: Their Power and Influence  and  The Morbid Streak .

","This is the biography of Professor N. Kasturi, the chosen biographer of Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba. This book is his autobiography, his story, his journey to the feet of the Lord, Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.  In his own words, ""Each of us has to live the volume of biography, which we bring with us, as often as we are born, page after page, chapter after chapter, howsoever punctuated with dots and dashes, interrogations and exclamations, commas and colons, until the sentence ends ultimately with a Full Stop. But, luckily, I have as my inseparable companion and counsel, Bhagawan Himself; He dots the i’s and crosses the t’s as I live the lines on every page. He has made the Book of Life, my biography – momentous and meaningful for me. I must, however, confess that I do not deserve this book on me, by me. There are, I know, millions, who are absorbing the Love of the Living Loving God much deeper, who can, therefore, stand forth as messengers of His Love. They can lead the unloved and the unloving with surer and firmer steps, to the Presence of the Redeemer, the Comforter, the Saviour, the Avatar, the Sai. Nevertheless, when Bhagawan manifested a faint, favourable interest, when someone ventured to whisper to me in His Presence, that a bunch of my reminiscences may be welcomed by many, I was promoted by that smile to embark on this audacious adventure. My memory assumed the role of Chief Editor and hence, the chronicle suffers from imperfect chronology. Since the four parts of 'Sathyam Sivam Sundram' relate most of that I have yearned to communicate, this book has become a personal testament, often perhaps too personal to be tolerated, for which act of indiscretion, I ask for pardon.  Flattery is the food of fools, say those, who are denied that pabulum. I dare not deny my taste, for I have been fooled by flatterers, who threw appellations like poet, scholar, linguist, humourist, philosopher, and even ant-hill sage! Please dear reader, remember that I am struggling my best to eliminate the poison of the ego and sympathise with me, whenever you find the reptile raising its hood between the lines of this book. A few ‘old students’ of my classes at the University, my grandson, his wife, and a few brothers at Prasanthi Nilayam demanded that I should not give up the work and insisted on the completion of the book. As a result, this book, ‘Loving God’ is now placed at the Feet of the Lord and on the palms of those, who live in the Love of the Lord. Jai Sai Ram.""",,,Kindle Edition,,398 pages,"

","Esta edición especial coordinada por el escritor Jonathan Minila consta de los cuentos de Árboles petrificados, de cartas que Julio Cortázar le escribió a Amparo Dávila, fotos personales de la autora, y textos de estudiosos de su obra, de los que extraemos estas líneas:He tenido un gran placer con la lectura de Tiempo destrozado, que me parece un excelente libro. En la solapa se habla de esta obra como de su primer libro de cuentos; si es así, admiro la maestría y la técnica que se advierten en cada página.Julio CortázarEscribir un cuento es capturar una sabiduría, misma que pretende condensar la quintaesencia de la experiencia humana. Amparo Dávila, gran lectora de la Biblia, no me dejará mentir. El Libro de la sabiduría lo declara de modo tajante: «Quien añade sabiduría, añade dolor». Cada uno de sus textos es una incursión en los territorios del sufrimiento.Evodio EscalanteSus criaturas deambulan por una cotidianidad extraordinariamente reconstruida y palpable. Esto permite que la oscuridad y las calamidades irrumpan en las historias con una fuerza sobrecogedora y más natural que sobrenatural.Bernardo EsquincaAmparo Dávila transita en dos mundos, como si al escribir de principio a fin y de izquierda a derecha, se estuviera escribiendo de manera inversa atrás de la página: de abajo hacia arriba y de derecha a izquierda... Trenza de manera natural la vida cotidiana con el mundo numinoso.Marianne ToussaintLejos de ofrecer una vía de escape del mundo conocido, como sugieren algunos, la imaginación fantástica persigue dar rienda suelta a la curiosidad humana y encontrar en la llamada realidad lo que nadie o quizá muy pocos han descubierto... Le creo a Amparo Dávila todas las veces que ha sugerido que sus historias emergen de lo real.Karen ChacekMás que arrinconar a Amparo Dávila con autores que tienen muy poco que decirle, se puede intentar el ejercicio que Borges realizó con la obra de Kafka: encontrar sus precursores leyendo a otros en función de ella y no al revés: reinterpretando la tradición a partir de lo que los textos de Dávila nos muestran de la condición y las experiencias (tanto exteriores como subjetivas) de los seres humanos.Alberto ChimalCon Árboles petrificados, Amparo Dávila demuestra que lo insólito es un acontecimiento que explota en la realidad, que los demonios se manifiestan en lo cotidiano y que la mente es quizá el peor de nuestros enemigos.Jonathan Minila",,,Paperback,(Edición Conmemorativa),159 pages,"

","Narrative weaving the biblical account of Mary and Jesus, the Egyptian myth of Isis and Osiris, and the Sumerian story of Inanna and Dumuzi to create an exotic tale of a strong, sensual woman.From Publishers WeeklyThis feminist retelling of the conception, birth, life and death of Christ as narrated by Mary Magdalene may cause some uproar in Christian circles. Yeshua (Christ) is born to Almah Mari (the Virgin Mary) after her union in Sacred Marriage at the Temple in Jerusalem with an unblemished man who kills himself as a sacrifice for his people. Later Mari Anath becomes Magdalene, or High Priestess of the Goddess, and assumes co-rule with Jehovah, succeeding Almah Mari. Mari Anath follows Yeshua in the years of his ministry, despite objections from some adherents who call her harlot because they oppose the double worship of the Goddess and Jehovah and the equality of sexes that relationship im plies. But days before the crucifixion, when Yeshua sacrifices himself, he and the Magdalene are united in Sacred Marriage in the Temple before the people. Mari Anath gives birth to Yeshua's daughter Anna after she and Judas (who is The Christos's twin brother and betrays him at his behest in order to fulfill the prophesy) flee to Gaul to make a new life. First novelist Kinstler, a professor of philosophy, mines the literature of myth to make this lyrically written interpretation plausible. She provides notes and a bibliography to buttress much of her tale.",0062504975,9780062504975),Paperback,,315 pages,"

","In his new book, Gurcharan Das turns to the Mahabharata in order to answer the question, ""why be good'', and discovers that the epic's world of moral haziness and uncertainty is closer to our experience as ordinary human beings than the narrow and rigid positions that define most debate in this fundamentalist age of moral certainty. The Mahabharata is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma - in essence, doing the right thing. When a hero falters, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and often contradictory take on dharma. The epic's characters are flawed, but their incoherent experiences throw light on our familiar dilemmas. Gurcharan Das's best-selling book India Unbound examined the classical aim of artha, material well being. This, his first book in seven years, dwells on the goal of dharma, moral well being. It addresses the central problem of how to live our lives in an examined way - holding a mirror up to us and forcing us to confront the many ways in which we deceive ourselves and others. What emerges is a doctrine of dharma that we can apply to our business decisions, political strategies and interpersonal relationships - in effect, to life itself.",0670083496,9780670083497),Hardcover,Royal,488 pages,"

A rich and complex interweaving of story and fable, poem, artwork, and music, it totally immerses the reader in the culture of the Kesh, a peaceful people of the far future who inhabit a place called the Valley on the Northern Pacific Coast. The author makes the inhabitants of the valley as familiar, as immediate, as wholly human as our own friends or family.

","Of all the faculties (except that which I shall soon mention), you will find not one which is capable of contemplating itself, and, consequently, not capable either of approving or disapproving. How far does the grammatic art possess the contemplating power? As far as forming a judgment about what is written and spoken. And how far music? As far as judging about melody. Does either of them then contemplate itself? By no means. But when you must write something to your friend, grammar will tell you what words you should write; but whether you should write or not, grammar will not tell you. And so it is with music as to musical sounds; but whether you should sing at the present time and play on the lute, or do neither, music will not tell you. What faculty then will tell you? That which contemplates both itself and all other things. And what is this faculty? The rational faculty; for this is the only faculty that we have received which examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and what is the value of this gift, and examines all other faculties: for what else is there which tells us that golden things are beautiful, for they do not say so themselves? Evidently it is the faculty which is capable of judging of appearances. What else judges of music, grammar, and the other faculties, proves their uses, and points out the occasions for using them? Nothing else.",,,Kindle Edition,,227 pages,"

","Death.She was afraid of it.He was used to it.There's not much that MacKenzie Rivers is afraid of. In the small town of Windsor, Colorado, she is known for her easygoing, strong personality, some would even say she isn't afraid of anything. But MacKenzie knows that's not true. She's afraid of losing those closest to her. Recovering from a family tragedy, Kenzie is fully aware of just how big an impact death can have on those it leaves behind. Seeing its effects on other people is something she just can't quite handle. From now on, Kenzie is her own priority.There are not many things that Jaden Hunter can make sense of. He doesn't understand why it was his parents who lost their lives last year. He doesn't understand why his friends don't crack jokes around him any more. He doesn't understand why his teachers still insist on letting him skip assignments. He doesn't understand why MacKenzie, the girl he was falling for last year, has suddenly distanced herself from him.Too afraid to get wrapped up in Jaden's world as he deals with the tragic death of his parents, Kenzie has stayed away from him as best she can, until one night when they unexpectedly come face-to-face for the first time in months. As old feelings resurface and new memories are made, both MacKenzie and Jaden show each other how to appreciate the little things in life, the moments that are taken for granted. But will MacKenzie dare to fall for the one person she's so afraid of growing close to?",,,Paperback,,325 pages,"

"," ""Nothing matters.""    ""From the moment you are born, you start to die.""    ""The Earth is 4.6 billion years old. You'll live to be a maximum of one hundred. Life isn't worth the bother!""   So says Pierre Anthon when he decides that there is no meaning to life, leaves the classroom, climbs a plum tree, and stays there.  His friends and classmates cannot get him to come down, not even by pelting him with rocks. So to prove to him that there is a meaning to life, they set out to build a heap of meaning in an abandoned sawmill.  But it soon becomes obvious that each person cannot give up what is most meaningful, so they begin to decide for one another what the others must give up. The pile is started with a lifetime's collection of Dungeons & Dragons books, a fishing rod, a pair of green sandals, a pet hamster -- but then, as each demand becomes more extreme, things start taking a very morbid twist, and the kids become ever more desperate to get Pierre Anthon down. And what if, after all these sacrifices, the pile is not meaningful enough?

","Twitter seems like a perfect start-up success story. In barely six years, a small group of young, ambitious programmers in Silicon Valley built an $11.5 billion business out of the ashes of a failed podcasting company. Today Twitter boasts more than 200 million active users and has affected business, politics, media, and other fields in innumerable ways. Now Nick Bilton of the New York Times takes readers behind the scenes with a narrative that shows what happened inside Twitter as it grew at exponential speeds. This is a tale of betrayed friendships and high-stakes power struggles as the four founders—Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Jack Dorsey, and Noah Glass—went from everyday engineers to wealthy celebrities, featured on magazine covers, Oprah, The Daily Show, and Time’s list of the world’s most influential people. Bilton’s exclusive access and exhaustive investigative reporting—drawing on hundreds of sources, documents, and internal e-mails—have enabled him to write an intimate portrait of fame, influence, and power. He also captures the zeitgeist and global influence of Twitter, which has been used to help overthrow governments in the Middle East and disrupt the very fabric of the way people communicate.",1444767046,9781444767049),Paperback,Paperback,,"

","Boxers & Saints Boxed Set EditionOne of the greatest comics storytellers alive brings all his formidable talents to bear in this astonishing new work.In two volumes, Boxers & Saints tells two parallel stories. The first is of Little Bao, a Chinese peasant boy whose village is abused and plundered by Westerners claiming the role of missionaries. Little Bao, inspired by visions of the Chinese gods, joins a violent uprising against the Western interlopers. Against all odds, their grass-roots rebellion is successful. But in the second volume, Yang lays out the opposite side of the conflict. A girl whose village has no place for her is taken in by Christian missionaries and finds, for the first time, a home with them. As the Boxer Rebellion gains momentum, Vibiana must decide whether to abandon her Christian friends or to commit herself fully to Christianity.Boxers & Saints is one of the most ambitious graphic novels First Second has ever published. It offers a penetrating insight into not only one of the most controversial episodes of modern Chinese history, but into the very core of our human nature. Gene Luen Yang is rightly called a master of the comics form, and this book will cement that reputation. This boxed set includes the trade paperback Boxers as well as the trade paperback Saints, packaged together in one slipcase.",1596439246,9781596439245),Paperback,Boxed Set,512 pages,"

","Magic, adventure, mystery, and romance combine in this epic debut in which a young princess must reclaim her dead mother’s throne, learn to be a ruler—and defeat the Red Queen, a powerful and malevolent sorceress determined to destroy her.On her nineteenth birthday, Princess Kelsea Raleigh Glynn, raised in exile, sets out on a perilous journey back to the castle of her birth to ascend her rightful throne. Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen’s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon—from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic—to prevent her from wearing the crown.Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing. But what she discovers in the capital will change everything, confronting her with horrors she never imagined. An act of singular daring will throw Kelsea’s kingdom into tumult, unleashing the vengeance of the tyrannical ruler of neighboring Mortmesne: the Red Queen, a sorceress possessed of the darkest magic. Now Kelsea will begin to discover whom among the servants, aristocracy, and her own guard she can trust.But the quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun—a wondrous journey of self-discovery and a trial by fire that will make her a legend . . . if she can survive.This book will be a beautifully designed package with illustrated endpapers, a map of the Tearling, and a ribbon marker.",006229038X,9780062290380),Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Following the USA Today bestseller, Lost and Found Sisters, comes Rainy Day Friends, Jill Shalvis’ moving story of heart, loss, betrayal, and friendship.Six months after Lanie Jacobs’ husband’s death, it’s hard to imagine anything could deepen her sense of pain and loss. But then Lanie discovers she isn’t the only one grieving his sudden passing. A serial adulterer, he left behind several other women who, like Lanie, each believe she was his legally wedded wife. Rocked by the infidelity, Lanie is left to grapple with searing questions. How could she be so wrong about a man she thought she knew better than anyone? Will she ever be able to trust another person? Can she even trust herself?Desperate to make a fresh start, Lanie impulsively takes a job at the family-run Capriotti Winery. At first, she feels like an outsider among the boisterous Capriottis. With no real family of her own, she’s bewildered by how quickly they all take her under their wing and make her feel like she belongs. Especially Mark Capriotti, a gruffly handsome Air Force veteran turned deputy sheriff who manages to wind his way into Lanie’s cold, broken heart—along with the rest of the clan.Everything is finally going well for her, but the arrival of River Green changes all that. The fresh-faced twenty-one-year old seems as sweet as they come…until her dark secrets come to light—secrets that could destroy the new life Lanie’s only just begun to build.",,,Kindle Edition,,365 pages,"

","From the author of the New York Times bestselling Once a Runner—“The best novel ever written about running” (Runner’s World)—comes that novel’s prequel, the story of a world-class athlete coming of age in the 1950s and 60s on Florida’s Gold Coast.Quenton Cassidy’s first foot races are with nature itself: the summer storms that sweep through his subtropical neighborhood. Shirtless, barefoot, and brown as a berry, Cassidy is a skinny, mouthy kid with aspirations to be a great athlete. As he explores his primal surroundings, along the Loxahatchee River and the nearby Atlantic Ocean, he is befriended by Trapper Nelson, “the Tarzan of the Loxahatchee,” a well-known eccentric who lives off the land.In junior high school, quite by chance, Cassidy discovers an ability to run long distances, but his real dream is to be a basketball star. Still, Cassidy absorbs Nelson’s view of running as a way of relating to and interacting with the natural world. Though he is warned of Nelson’s checkered past, Cassidy dismisses the stories as superstitious gossip, until his small town is stunned by the disappearance of a prominent judge and his wife. Cassidy’s loyalty to his friend is severely tested just as his opportunity to make his mark as a gifted runner comes to fruition.John Parker’s prequel to the New York Times bestseller Once a Runner vividly captures how a runner is formed and the physical endurance, determination, and mindset he develops on the way to becoming a champion. Racing the Rain is an epic coming-of-age classic about the environments and friendships that shape us all.",1476769869,9781476769868),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

However, you can come up with different images in your head and play around with the settings, character styles, and backstory, which is optional.  Sketching your drawing is essential. The face, eyes, poses, ear, hair, stance, perspective, emotions, and angles are important.

","1963 saw Labour's emergence from its 'wilderness years' in Opposition, and the election of Harold Wilson following the unexpected death of Hugh Gaitskell. In the first Wilson government of 1964 Benn was made Postmaster General and became known as an innovator for his introduction of the Giro and arguing for a radical broadcasting policy. After Labour's landslide victory of 1966 he was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of Technology, but Labour's honeymoon came to an abrupt end in 1967 with the introduction of devaluation, leading to disilliusionment with the Government.Tony Benn's account on his relations with the industrialists, television and press chiefs, the Palace and the diplomatic world as well as trade unionists, civil servants, and his Cabinet colleagues, reveals the workings of our political and economic systems at the highest level.Out of the Wilderness is a unique political record of the 1960s, told by a man who served in five Labour administrations and who today is one of the most experienced figures both in and out of the House of Commons.",0099586703,9780099586708),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","Prize-winning journalist Jack Olsen, armed with unprecedented access to one of the most infamous serial killers in American history, provides a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a murderer in the killer's own words . . .In February 1990, Oregon State Police arrested John Sosnovke and Laverne Pavlinac for the vicious rape and murder of Taunja Bennet, a troubled 23-year-old barfly who had suffered mild retardation since birth. Pavlinac had come forth and confessed, implicating her boyfriend and producing physical evidence that linked them to the crime. Authorities closed the case.There was just one problem. They had the wrong people.And the real killer wasn't about to let anyone take credit for his kill. Keith Hunter Jesperson was a long haul truck driver and the murderer of eight women, including Taunja Bennet. As the case wound through police precincts and courts--ending in life sentences for both Sosnovke and Pavlinac--Jesperson began a twisted one man campaign to win their release. To the editors of newspapers and on the walls of highway rest stops, Jesperson scribbled out a series of taunting confessions:I killed Tanya Bennett . . . I beat her to death, raped her and loved it. Yes I'm sick, but I enjoy myself too. People took the blame and I'm free . . ..Look over your shoulder. I may be closer than you think.At the end of each confession, Jesperson drew a happy face, earning for himself the grisly sobriquet ""The Happy Face Killer.""Based on access to interviews, diaries, court records, and the criminal himself, I: The Creation of a Serial Killer is Jesperson's chilling story. It chronicles his evolution from angry child to sociopathic murderer, from tormentor of animals to torturer of women. It is also the story of the fate that befell him after two innocent citizens were imprisoned four years for one of his killings.Edgar Award winner Jack Olsen lets the killer to tell his story in his own words, offering unprecedented insight into the twisted thought process of a serial murderer. Olsen takes his readers along on Jesperson's vicious cross-country killing spree, letting him describe how he played his ""death game"" with eight innocent victims and how he finally came to grips with the fate he deserved.I: The Creation of a Serial Killer is one of the most revealing and insightful pieces of crime reporting ever published.",0312241984,9780312241988),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

Ale to również dwa przeciwstawne sobie znaki – jeden symbolizuje perskich magów ognia, drugi walczących z nimi prawowiernych chrześcijan. Ich walka jest jednym z elementów fabuły nowego cyklu o świecie, w którym Chrystus zstąpił z krzyża.W 1. tomie poznasz losy inkwizytora Mordimera Madderdina widziane oczami między innymi Pięknej Katarzyny - matki Madderdina oraz Arnolda Lowefella - jego mentora i nauczyciela, członka Wewnętrznego Kręgu Inkwizytorium. A wszystko w krwawej scenerii chłopskiego buntu pustoszącego Cesarstwo, w bogatym domu pięknej kurtyzany parającej się mroczną sztuką, w mistycznej siedzibie perskiego czarnoksiężnika, w Akademii Inkwizytorium oraz w siedzibie Świętego Officjum – tajemniczym klasztorze Amszilas.Z punktu widzenia chronologii, tom ten otwiera „cykl inkwizytorski” Jacka Piekary. Jest więc doskonałym wprowadzeniem w świat wykreowany przez autora. Natomiast dobrym znajomym Madderdina odpowie na szereg pytań. Co sprawiło, że został Sługą Bożym i Młotem na Czarownice oraz czemu posiada nadnaturalne zdolności? Jaki mroczny sekret związał matkę inkwizytora z wszechwładnym biskupem Gersardem?

","‘It is best to do nothing! The best thing is conscious inertia! So long live the underground!’Alienated from society and paralysed by a sense of his own insignificance, the anonymous narrator of Dostoyevsky’s groundbreaking Notes from Underground tells the story of his tortured life. With bitter sarcasm, he describes his refusal to become a worker in the ‘ant-hill’ of society and his gradual withdrawal to an existence ‘underground’. The seemingly ordinary world of St Petersburg takes on a nightmarish quality in The Double when a government clerk encounters a man who exactly resembles him – his double perhaps, or possibly the darker side of his own personality. Like Notes from Underground, this is a masterly study of human consciousness.Jessie Coulson’s introduction discusses the stories’ critical reception and the themes they share with Dostoyevksy’s great novels.",0140442529,9780140442526),Paperback,Penguin Classics,287 pages,"

","College student Joe Talbert has the modest goal of completing a writing assignment for an English class. His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe's life is ever the same.Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran--and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live, he has been medically paroled to a nursing home, after spending thirty years in prison for the crimes of rape and murder.As Joe writes about Carl's life, especially Carl's valor in Vietnam, he cannot reconcile the heroism of the soldier with the despicable acts of the convict. Joe, along with his skeptical female neighbor, throws himself into uncovering the truth, but he is hamstrung in his efforts by having to deal with his dangerously dysfunctional mother, the guilt of leaving his autistic brother vulnerable, and a haunting childhood memory. Thread by thread, Joe unravels the tapestry of Carl’s conviction. But as he and Lila dig deeper into the circumstances of the crime, the stakes grow higher. Will Joe discover the truth before it’s too late to escape the fallout?From the Trade Paperback edition.",1616149981,9781616149987),Paperback,,303 pages,"

","The Hound of the Baskervilles is the third of the crime novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. Originally serialized in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902, it is set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country and tells the story of an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson investigate the case. This was the first appearance of Holmes since his intended death in ""The Final Problem"", and the success of The Hound of the Baskervilles led to the character's eventual revival.In 2003, the book was listed as number 128 of 200 on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's ""best-loved novel."" In 1999, it was listed as the top Holmes novel, with a perfect rating from Sherlockian scholars of 100.",,,Kindle Edition,Wisehouse Classics Edition,117 pages,"

","Jesus commanded that we follow him in his Mission in order “to save,” instead of enter a church in order “to be saved.”Following Jesus is a “discipleship for world liberation,” not “church membership for personal salvation.”Where people are gathered to give worship to God through ceremonial chanting, singing, dancing, listening to a sermon, and offering money for the life of the church, there you can find the Christian CHURCH OF PAUL. On the other hand, where people are gathered to give care and help to one another for the glory of God, there you can find the CHURCH OF JESUS. Indeed, the true church of Jesus is a TOOL to bring life to the world, more than a PLACE where we can go and save our individual souls.Receiving Jesus in our hearts is receiving his Mission to renew the world, rather than taking our position as one that is already saved in the world.Amen.",,,,,,,[]

","Kat: Life always finds a way to fuck you over.  I found that one out the hard way before I was even thirteen. Before that, my life had been perfect and then I was stripped away from my family. And while it certainly wasn’t what you’d call the typical family, it had been my family, my life. I had everything: loving parents, a huge biker family (even though they did fight like cat and dogs a lot), and the love from every member of one of the most notorious clubs in United States history. The Reapers blood flew through every vein in my body.  It took my years to find out why—or better who—had stripped me of my life, never knowing who the man was that’d taken everything from me. But he certainly knew who I was and, more importantly, he knew my parents. He took me hostage just to get back at my parents for something that had happened years ago.  I was the price my parents paid. Worst of all, I’ve been stuck here for years. Nothing about my stay with the Demons of Hell motorcycle club is glorious, especially not with the things they say and worst of all, the things they force me to do. I started out as a girl full of light but having spent so much time in the dark has sucked almost every bit of light I had left.  Darkness was all I’d known until I met him, and he lit the last remaining ember I’d had left inside me.  Damon  When I agreed to go undercover at the Demons of Hell motorcycle club, I had no idea exactly what my father had been signing me up for.  My father’s personal gain had been my sole purpose. Growing up in the Brotherhood Motorcycle Club had given me a good idea of the club life but being thrown into Rage’s idea of a club was something that nobody could’ve prepared me for.  Four years in this club and I’d learned next to nothing. Every day, I could feel myself getting closer to the information my father sent me for, that my family needed. My father had abandoned everything, and it had all been Rage’s fault. Even so, my father had vowed to return, to right every and all wrongdoing that Rage had had a hand in and he would fulfill that promise.  And while I may have come here for my father’s bidding, that wasn’t the reason I’d decided to stay. I could’ve made the choice a long time ago to run back home, to return even if it was with nothing useful. Every single day that I’m here, I stare in the face of the person I’ve decided to stay for. Her face screams how lost and broken she is, how she’s had everything ripped from her by him. Rage calls her his property and I’m letting him think that for now.  If only he knew about the way she looks at me whenever she’s not in his sight…",,,Kindle Edition,,214 pages,"

Polemisch, streitbar und sprachgewaltig formuliert er in 62 Abschnitten die Kernthesen seiner fundamentalen Kritik des Christentums. Auf unnachahmliche Weise bündelt der große Philosoph hier die Argumente seiner früheren Werke zu einer letzten vehementen Abrechnung mit der mächtigsten Wurzel europäischer Kultur.

","Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighborhood, the lives of Mr and Mrs Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly by its captivating wisdom.",0199535566,9780199535569),Paperback,Oxford World's Classics,333 pages,"

","From the Emmy, PEN, Peabody, Critics' Choice, and Golden Globe Award-winning creator of the TV show Fargo comes the thriller of the year.On a foggy summer night, 11 people - 10 privileged, one down-on-his-luck painter - depart Martha's Vineyard on a private jet headed for New York. Sixteen minutes later the unthinkable happens: The plane plunges into the ocean. The only survivors are Scott Burroughs - the painter - and a four-year-old boy who is now the last remaining member of an immensely wealthy and powerful media mogul's family. With chapters weaving between the aftermath of the crash and the backstories of the passengers and crew members - including a Wall Street titan and his wife, a Texan-born party boy just in from London, a young woman questioning her path in life, and a career pilot - the mystery surrounding the tragedy heightens. As the passengers' intrigues unravel, odd coincidences point to a conspiracy. Was it merely by dumb chance that so many influential people perished? Or was something far more sinister at work? Events soon threaten to spiral out of control in an escalating storm of media outrage and accusations. And while Scott struggles to cope with fame that borders on notoriety, the authorities scramble to salvage the truth from the wreckage. Amid pulse-quickening suspense, the fragile relationship between Scott and the young boy glows at the heart of this stunning novel, raising questions of fate, human nature, and the inextricable ties that bind us together.",,,Kindle Edition,,401 pages,"

","Łaskawe to fikcyjne wspomnienia byłego oficera SS, Maximiliana Aue, doktora prawa konstytucyjnego, miłośnika muzyki, literatury i filozofii, a jednocześnie nazistowskiego zbrodniarza, któremu po wojnie udało się uniknąć kary i znaleźć bezpieczny azyl za biurkiem dyrektora fabryki koronek na północy Francji. Szokujący autoportret nazisty-estety, który patrząc na pogromy ludności żydowskiej myśli o Platonie i bardziej niż Rosenberga czy Hansa Franka woli cytować Tertuliana.Powieść Jonathana Littella ukazuje kulisy Zagłady i rolę, jaką w jej przygotowaniu odegrali technokraci i eksperci: prawnicy, ekonomiści i świetnie wykwalifikowana kadra administracyjna. To znakomicie udokumentowana powieść historyczna, a zarazem uniwersalna przypowieść o spotkaniu Człowieka ze Złem. Wielowątkowa epopeja zbudowana na wzór suity Johanna Sebastiana Bacha i nasycona pięknie aluzjami do greckiej tragedii o matkobójcy Orestesie oraz ścigających go Eryniach, które w finale dramatu przemieniają się w Boginie Łaskawe... ""Łaskawe wpadły na mój trop"" – to ostatnie zdanie zapisane przez Maxa Aue.Łaskawe to najgłośniejsza i najbardziej kontrowersyjna książka ostatnich lat.

","Ellingham Academy is a famous private school in Vermont for the brightest thinkers, inventors, and artists. It was founded by Albert Ellingham, an early twentieth century tycoon, who wanted to make a wonderful place full of riddles, twisting pathways, and gardens. ""A place"" he said, ""where learning is a game.""Shortly after the school opened, his wife and daughter were kidnapped. The only real clue was a mocking riddle listing methods of murder, signed with the frightening pseudonym, Truly Devious. It became one of the great unsolved crimes of American history. True-crime aficionado Stevie Bell is set to begin her first year at Ellingham Academy, and she has an ambitious plan: She will solve this cold case. That is, she will solve the case when she gets a grip on her demanding new school life and her housemates: the inventor, the novelist, the actor, the artist, and the jokester. But something strange is happening. Truly Devious makes a surprise return, and death revisits Ellingham Academy. The past has crawled out of its grave. Someone has gotten away with murder.",,,Kindle Edition,,432 pages,"

","A true story about why we sabotage ourselves, feel overwhelmed, set aside our dreams, and lack the courage to simply be ourselves... and how to start choosing happiness again! Are you happy? It may be the wrong question. Most of us think we are relatively happy, while at the same time knowing that we could be happier -- maybe even a lot happier. Ordinary people and the finest philosophers have been exploring the question of happiness for thousands of years, and theories abound. But this is not a book of theory. Resisting Happiness is a deeply personal, disarmingly transparent look at why we sabotage our own happiness and what to do about it. Are you overwhelmed? Do you procrastinate? Do you sometimes feel like you are your own worst enemy?",1942611927,9781942611929),Paperback,,186 pages,"

","A novel of serendipity, of fortunes won and lost, and of the spectre of imprisonment that hangs over all aspects of Victorian society, Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit is edited with an introduction by Stephen Wall in Penguin Classics.When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, he takes a kindly interest in Amy Dorrit, his mother's seamstress, and in the affairs of Amy's father, William Dorrit, a man of shabby grandeur, long imprisoned for debt in Marshalsea prison. As Arthur soon discovers, the dark shadow of the prison stretches far beyond its walls to affect the lives of many, from the kindly Mr Panks, the reluctant rent-collector of Bleeding Heart Yard, and the tipsily garrulous Flora Finching, to Merdle, an unscrupulous financier, and the bureaucratic Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office. A masterly evocation of the state and psychology of imprisonment, Little Dorrit is one of the supreme works of Dickens's maturity.Stephen Wall's introduction examines Dickens's transformation of childhood memories of his father's incarceration in the Marshalsea debtors' prison. This revised edition includes expanded notes, appendices and suggestion for further reading by Helen Small, a chronology of Dickens's life and works, and original illustrations.Charles Dickens is one of the best-loved novelists in the English language, whose 200th anniversary was celebrated in 2012. His most famous books, including Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities, David Copperfield and The Pickwick Papers, have been adapted for stage and screen and read by millions.If you enjoyed Little Dorrit, you might like Dickens's Barnaby Rudge, also available in Penguin Classics.",,,Hardcover,,880 pages,"

","On December 18, 1999, Julia Butterfly Hill's feet touched the ground for the first time in over two years, as she descended from ""Luna,"" a thousandyear-old redwood in Humboldt County, California.Hill had climbed 180 feet up into the tree high on a mountain on December 10, 1997, for what she thought would be a two- to three-week-long ""tree-sit."" The action was intended to stop Pacific Lumber, a division of the Maxxam Corporation, from the environmentally destructive process of clear-cutting the ancient redwood and the trees around it. The area immediately next to Luna had already been stripped and, because, as many believed, nothing was left to hold the soil to the mountain, a huge part of the hill had slid into the town of Stafford, wiping out many homes.Over the course of what turned into an historic civil action, Hill endured El Nino storms, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and the tremendous sorrow brought about by an old-growth forest's destruction. This story--written while she lived on a tiny platform eighteen stories off the ground--is one that only she can tell.Twenty-five-year-old Julia Butterfly Hill never planned to become what some have called her--the Rosa Parks of the environmental movement. Shenever expected to be honored as one of Good Housekeeping's ""Most Admired Women of 1998"" and George magazine's ""20 Most Interesting Women in Politics,"" to be featured in People magazine's ""25 Most Intriguing People of the Year"" issue, or to receive hundreds of letters weekly from young people around the world. Indeed, when she first climbed into Luna, she had no way of knowing the harrowing weather conditions and the attacks on her and her cause. She had no idea of the loneliness she would face or that her feet wouldn't touch ground for more than two years. She couldn't predict the pain of being an eyewitness to the attempted destruction of one of the last ancient redwood forests in the world, nor could she anticipate the immeasurable strength she would gain or the life lessons she would learn from Luna. Although her brave vigil and indomitable spirit have made her a heroine in the eyes of many, Julia's story is a simple, heartening tale of love, conviction, and the profound courage she has summoned to fight for our earth's legacy.",0062516590,9780062516596),Paperback,,262 pages,"

The transformation of state and society, the violent transference of power and property, and the establishment of Augustus' rule are presented in an unconventional narrative, which quotes from ancient evidence, refers seldomly to modern authorities, and states controversial opinions quite openly.

Byatt’s Possession and Geraldine Brooks’s People of the Book.Set in London of the 1660s and of the early twenty-first century, The Weight of Ink is the interwoven tale of two women of remarkable intellect: Ester Velasquez, an emigrant from Amsterdam who is permitted to scribe for a blind rabbi, just before the plague hits the city; and Helen Watt, an ailing historian with a love of Jewish history.   As the novel opens, Helen has been summoned by a former student to view a cache of seventeenth-century Jewish documents newly discovered in his home during a renovation. Enlisting the help of Aaron Levy, an American graduate student as impatient as he is charming, and in a race with another fast-moving team of historians, Helen embarks on one last project: to determine the identity of the documents’ scribe, the elusive “Aleph.”   Electrifying and ambitious, sweeping in scope and intimate in tone, The Weight of Ink is a sophisticated work of historical fiction about women separated by centuries, and the choices and sacrifices they must make in order reconcile the life of the heart and mind.",,,Kindle Edition,,592 pages,"

","From New York Times bestselling author Meg Waite Clayton comes a riveting novel based on one of the most volatile and intoxicating real-life love affairs of the twentieth century.Key West, 1936. Headstrong, accomplished journalist Martha Gellhorn is confident with words but less so with men when she meets disheveled literary titan Ernest Hemingway in a dive bar. Their friendship—forged over writing, talk, and family dinners—flourishes into something undeniable in Madrid while they’re covering the Spanish Civil War.Martha reveres him. The very married Hemingway is taken with Martha—her beauty, her ambition, and her fearless spirit. And as Hemingway tells her, the most powerful love stories are always set against the fury of war. The risks are so much greater. They’re made for each other.With their romance unfolding as they travel the globe, Martha establishes herself as one of the world’s foremost war correspondents, and Hemingway begins the novel that will win him the Nobel Prize for Literature. Beautiful Exiles is a stirring story of lovers and rivals, of the breathless attraction to power and fame, and of one woman—ahead of her time—claiming her own identity from the wreckage of love.",1503900835,9781503900837),Hardcover,,396 pages,"

","The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series - set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen - all of them - and they're stronger than ever.They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus - in order to wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over...Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide'A cracking read' - Sunday Express'Explosive' - Big Issue'Action-packed' - Telegraph Rick Riordan is an award-winning mystery writer.

","In Oathbringer humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.Dalinar Kholin’s Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar’s blood-soaked past and stand together—and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past—even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.",,,Kindle Edition,,1220 pages,"

","Are you ready to see your fixer upper?These famous words are now synonymous with the dynamic husband-and-wife team Chip and Joanna Gaines, stars of HGTV s Fixer Upper. As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like Who are these people?What s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life? By renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper, they have become America s new best friends.The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together. From the very first renovation project they ever tackled together, to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them, to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today.They both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day.In The Magnolia Story fans will finally get to join the Gaines behind the scenes and discover: The time Chip ran to the grocery store and forgot to take their new, sleeping baby Joanna s agonizing decision to close her dream business to focus on raising their children When Chip buys a houseboat, sight-unseen, and it turns out to be a leaky wreck Joanna s breakthrough moment of discovering the secret to creating a beautiful home Harrowing stories of the financial ups and downs as an entrepreneurial couple Memories and photos from Chip and Jo s wedding The significance of the word magnolia and why it permeates everything they do The way the couple pays the popularity of Fixer Upper forward, sharing the success with others, and bolstering the city of Waco along the wayAnd yet there is still one lingering question for fans of the show: Is Chip really that funny? Oh yeah, says Joanna. He was, and still is, my first fixer upper. """,0718079183,9780718079185),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

Finn—#1 New York Times bestselling author of The Woman in the Window—as “extraordinary…crackles and snaps like a bonfire on a winter’s night.”My husband did not mean to kill Annie Doyle, but the lying tramp deserved it. On the surface, Lydia Fitzsimons's life seems idyllic. Her husband, Andrew, is a prosperous, respected judge; they live in the spacious, comfortable, well-appointed house where she was raised. And she is utterly, obsessively devoted to her son, Laurence—her adored only child, her pride and joy. But Andrew's murder of Annie Doyle, accidental or not, sets into motion a dark downward spiral. It doesn’t take long for Laurence to suspect that something is very, very wrong in the Fitzsimons household—and he is determined to discover the truth. For fans of Ruth Ware and Gillian Flynn, Lying in Wait is “a devastating psychological thriller...an exquisitely uncomfortable, utterly captivating reading experience” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).",1501178474,9781501178474),Paperback,,336 pages,"

But then a gust of wind and a distant voice send him on a dizzying ride in a silver bucket, and Oyster finds himself, his own map in hand, in someone else's imaginary world—a place where rivers breathe and sugar snows down from the sky. Whose world is it? And what does it have to do with Oyster's map? You'll have to read the book to find out.Imagine that.",006079108X,9780060791087),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","To read Heidegger is to set out on an adventure. The essays in this volume are intriguing, challenging, & often baffling to the reader, calling him to abandon all superficial scanning & to enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking. Heidegger is not a 'primitive' or a 'romantic.' He is not one who seeks escape from the burdens & responsibilities of contemporary life into serenity, either through the re-creating of some idyllic past or through the exalting of some simple experience. Finally, Heidegger is not a foe of technology & science. He neither disdains nor rejects them as though they were only destructive of human life. The roots of Heidegger's thinking lie deep in the Western philosophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many of its aspects, in its language, & in its literary expression. In the development of this thought Heidegger has been taught chiefly by the Greeks, by German idealism, by phenomenology, & by the scholastic theological tradition. In him these & other elements have been fused by his genius of sensitivity * intellect into a very individual philosophical expression.""--William Lovitt's Introduction",0061319694,9780061319693),Paperback,,222 pages,"

Among them is Zoyd Wheeler who is preparing for his annual act of televised insanity (for which he receives a government stipend) when an unwelcome face appears from out of his past.An old nemesis, federal prosecutor Brock Vond, storms into Vineland at the head of a heavily armed strike force. Soon Zoyd and his daughter, Prairie, go into hiding while Vond begins a relationship with Zoyd's ex-wife and uses Prairie as a pawn against the mother she never knew she had.Part daytime drama, part political thriller, Vineland is a strange evocation of a twentieth-century America headed for a less than harmonic future.",3499136287,9783499136283),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","Considering job, housework, and child care, women work roughly fifteen hours more each week than men. A Woman's Guide to a Simpler Life is a thoughtful and eloquently written primer that shows women how to set limits and clear their minds and closets to create space for what is truly valuable: work, home, family,  friendships, and traditions.Dr. Van Steenhouse identifies three key obstacles to simplification: the fear of appearing selfish, the tug of internal resistance, and the trap of perfectionism. Pointing out the perils of modern living, she shows us that we don't have to be slaves to technology; we can pull the plug sometimes to give ourselves space.With sensible, soulful advice and real-life anecdotes, A Woman's Guide to a Simpler Life helps women minimize intrusions upon their spirits that take up time and energy without providing a sense of renewal and enrichment. It encourages women to listen to their hearts, absolve themselves of guilt and unrealistic expectations, have the courage to say no, and pare away nonessentials to live a saner, more fulfilling life. Dr. Van Steenhouse's invaluable lesson: A simpler life is one in which the knowledge of what matters dictates all that surrounds us, giving us the courage to let go of what our hearts know does not belong.From the Hardcover edition.",0609801457,9780609801451),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Jest rok 1919. W Kielcach przychodzi na świat dziewczynka. Roztargniona rodzina przez pięć lat nie może się zebrać, aby nadać jej imię. Mówią o niej „Lalka"", „Laleczka"", „Lalunia"". W końcu rodzice wywiązują się ze swojego obowiązku, jednak dziewczynka na zawsze już pozostaje Lalą. W powieści Jacka Dehnela imię bohaterki nabiera jednak dodatkowych znaczeń. Z jednej strony jest wyrazem czułości, jaką przez całe życie otaczana była przez bliskich, z drugiej zaś metaforą jej starczego bezwładu i zdziecinnienia, powolnego zapadania w letarg, którego jesteśmy świadkami w ostatniej części utworu.Rozpięta pomiędzy tradycją rodzinnej sagi, biografii, powieści o dojrzewaniu i wywiadu-rzeki, Lala jest historią kobiety, która wbrew temu, co nieustannie powtarzała, zawsze miała więcej rozumu niż szczęścia.

","""For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel that it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life.""So wrote a quiet young Ohioan in 1900, one in an ancient line of men who had wanted to fly -- men who wanted it passionately, fecklessly, hopelessly. But now, at the turn of the twentieth century, Wilbur Wright and a scattered handful of other adventurers conceived a conviction that the dream lay at last within reach, and in a headlong race across ten years and two continents, they competed to conquer the air. James Tobin, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in biography, has at last given this inspiring story its definitive telling.For years Wright and his younger brother, Orville, experimented in utter obscurity, supported only by their exceptional family. Meanwhile, the world watched as the imperious Samuel Langley, armed with a rich contract from the U.S. War Department and all the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, sought to scale up his unmanned models to create the first manned flying machine. But while Langley became obsessed with flight as a problem of power, the Wrights grappled with it as a problem of balance. Thus their machines took two very different paths -- his toward oblivion, theirs toward the heavens.As Tobin relates, the Wrights' 1903 triumph at Kitty Hawk, however hallowed in American lore, was ill-reported and disbelieved. So, while the two brothers struggled to transform their delicate contraption into a practical airplane, others moved to overtake them as the leading pioneers of flight. In France, rivals scoffed at the Wrightseven as they rushed to imitate them. At home, the great inventor Alexander Graham Bell seized the fallen banner of his friend Langley and thrust it into the hands of a circle of young daredevils, urging them to get into the air. From this group emerged the motorcyclist Glenn Curtiss, fastest man in the world, whose aerial challenge to Wilbur Wright culminated in an unforgettable showdown over New York harbor.""To Conquer the Air"" is a hero's tale of overcoming obstacles within and without that plumbs the depths of creativity and character. With a historian's accuracy and a novelist's eye, Tobin has captured the interplay of remarkable personalities at an extraordinary moment in our history. In the centennial year of human flight, ""To Conquer the Air"" is itself a heroic achievement.",0684856883,9780684856889),Hardcover,,433 pages,"

","From America's most beloved comedic actress and the star of Desperate Housewives comes a personal, heartfelt, and often very funny manifesto on life, love, and the lessons we all need to learn -- and unlearn -- on the road to happinessTeri Hatcher secured her place in America's heart when she stood up to accept her Golden Globe for Best Actress and declared herself a ""has-been"" on national television. That moment showcased her down-to-earth, self-deprecating style -- and her frank openness about the ups and downs she's experienced in life and work.But what the world might not have seen that night is that Teri's self-acceptance is the hard-won effort of a single mother with all the same struggles most women have to juggle -- life, love, bake sale cookies, and dying cats. Now, in the hope that her foibles and insights might inspire and motivate other women, Teri opens up about the little moments that have sustained her through good times and bad.From the everyday (like the importance of letting your daughter spill her macaroni so she knows it's okay to make mistakes) to the rare (a rendezvous with a humpback whale -- and no, he was not a suitor), the message at the heart of Burnt Toast -- that happiness and success are choices that we owe it to ourselves to make -- is sure to resonate with women everywhere.",1401302629,9781401302627),Hardcover,,207 pages,"

At eleven, Pip Mackenzie's young life has already been touched by tragedy; nine months before, a terrible accident plunged her mother Ophelie into inconsolable grief. But on this chilly July afternoon, Pip meets artist Matt Bowles, who offers to teach the girl to draw--and can't help but notice her beautiful, lonely mother.Matt Bowles senses something magical about Pip, who reminds him of his own daughter at that age, before a bitter divorce tore his family apart and swept his children halfway across the world.

As Matt confronts unfinished business from his past, and Ophelie is struck by a stunning betrayal, out of the darkness that has shadowed them both comes an unexpected gift of hope.",0739437585,9780739437582),Hardcover,,338 pages,"

""' Albert Schweitzer spanning many decades and a host of topics, this rich collection of the words of Albert Schweitzer offers a glimpse into the life and thought of an eminent humanitarian.""Reverence for Life"" was Schweitzer's unifying term for a concept of ethics. He believed that such an ethic would reconcile the drives of altruism and egoism by requiring a respect for the lives of all other beings and by demanding the highest development of an individual's resources. The thread of this inspirational belief appears throughout his deeply insightful writings. Excerpts from previously(continued from front flap)unpublished letters to John F. Kennedy, Norman Cousins, Bertrand Russell, and others show how truly committed Schweitzer was to creating a global consciousness and cultivating a dignity toward all people. A foreword by Schweitzer's daughter, Rhena Schweitzer Miller, an introduction by the editor, and a brief biographical sketch of Schweitzer's life round out this stunning collection of quotations.",0883659271,9780883659274),Hardcover,,,"

But suddenly, catapulted back in time to the days of the Old West, Catalina was transported into a world of blazing six-guns and ladies of the evening.

","Known for his meaty seriocomic novels, Tom Robbins’s shorter work has appeared in publications ranging from Esquire to Harper’s, from Playboy to the New York Times. Collected here for the first time in paperback, the essays, articles, observations—and even some untypical country-music lyrics—offer a rare overview of the eclectic sensibility of an American original. Whether rocking with the Doors, depoliticizing Picasso’s Guernica, lamenting the angst-ridden state of contemporary literature, or drooling over tomato sandwiches and a species of womanhood he calls “the genius waitress,” Tom Robbins’s briefer writings exhibit the five traits that perhaps best characterize his novels: an imaginative wit, a cheerfully brash disregard for convention, a sweetly nasty eroticism, a mystical but keenly observant eye, and an irrepressible love of language. Embedded in this primarily journalistic compilation are brand-new short stories, a sheaf of largely unpublished poems, and an offbeat assessment of our divided nation. Wherever you open Wild Ducks Flying Backward, you’ll encounter the serious playfulness that percolates from the mind of a self-described “romantic Zen hedonist” and “stray dog in the banquet halls of culture.”",0553383531,9780553383539),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","A woman survives a horrific attempt on her life, only to feel like a stranger in her own home, in the electrifying new novel from New York Times-bestselling author Karen Robards.  The house is all wrong. Her clothes are all wrong. When Katharine Lawrence recovers consciousness on the kitchen floor, staggers to her feet and looks at herself in the mirror, the beautiful face staring back at her is familiar-but wrong. Despite all the evidence-her pictures are all over the apartment, the clothes in the closets are the right size, and it's her hair caught in the brush atop the dresser-everything feels wrong.  Maybe the trauma of the attempt on her life has given her some kind of amnesia. She's twenty-nine, the special assistant to the head of the National Security Agency, and she's lucky to be alive. She also knows she can trust no one.  Before she can act on her instincts and run for her life, CIA Agent Nick Huston arrives on the scene. The CIA is conducting a special investigation of Katharine's boss, and the mystified woman in her ""unreal"" house is the key to the operation. But the real Katharine Lawrence has been whisked away for debriefing, and this expendable lookalike, Jenna Hill, is being used until the CIA gets the information it needs. But no one counted on Jenna Hill's outrage at being used. And no one-least of all Nick-could have anticipated the heat that flares between them as the game plays on.",0399154167,9780399154164),Hardcover,,340 pages,"

","John Gardner's most poignant novel of improbable love.At the heart of John Gardner's Nickel Mountain is an uncommon love story: when at 42, the obese, anxious and gentle Henry Soames marries seventeen-year-old Callie Wells—who is pregnant with the child of a local boy—it is much more than years which define the gulf between them. But the beauty of this novel is the gradual revelation of the bond that develops as this unlikely couple experiences courtship and marriage, the birth of a son, isolation, forgiveness, work, and death in a small Catskill community in the 1950s. The plot turns on tragic events—they might be accidents or they might be acts of will—involving a cast of rural eccentrics that includes a lonely amputee veteran, a religious hysteric (thought by some to be the devil himself) and an itinerant ""Goat Lady."" Questions of guilt, innocence, and even murder are eclipsed by deeds of compassion, humility, and redemption, and ultimately by Henry Soames' quiet discovery of grace.Novelist William H. Gass, a friend and colleague of the author, has written an introduction that shines new light on the work and career of the much praised but often misunderstood John Gardner.",0394488830,9780394488837),Hardcover,,312 pages,"

And surprise! Now he's one, too. For some couples, the whole biting-and-blood thing would have been a deal breaker. But Tommy and Jody are in love, and they vow to work through their issues. But word has it that the vampire who initially nibbled on Jody wasn't supposed to be recruiting. Even worse, Tommy's erstwhile turkey-bowling pals are out to get him, at the urging of a blue-dyed Las Vegas call girl named (duh) Blue.

","Shalom Auslander was raised with a terrified respect for God. Even as he grew up and was estranged from his community, his religion and its traditions, he could not find his way to a life where he didn't struggle against God daily.  Foreskin's Lament reveals Auslander's youth in a strict, socially isolated Orthodox community, and recounts his rebellion and efforts to make a new life apart from it. Auslander remembers his youthful attempt to win the ""blessing bee"" (the Orthodox version of a spelling bee), his exile to an Orthodox-style reform school in Israel after he's caught shoplifting Union Bay jeans from the mall, and his fourteen mile hike to watch the New York Rangers play in Madison Square Garden without violating the Sabbath. Throughout, Auslander struggles to understand God and His complicated, often contradictory laws. He tries to negotiate with God and His representatives-a day of sin-free living for a day of indulgence, a blessing for each profanity. But ultimately, Shalom settles for a peaceful cease-fire, a standoff with God, and accepts the very slim remaining hope that his newborn son might live free of guilt, doubt, and struggle.  Auslander's combination of unrelenting humor and anger--one that draws comparisons to memoirists David Sedaris and Dave Eggers--renders a rich and fascinating portrait of a man grappling with his faith, family, and community.",1594489556,9781594489556),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

In it, noted cultural historian Thomas Berry provides nothing less than a new intellectual-ethical framework for the human community by positing planetary well-being as the measure of all human activity.Drawing on the wisdom of Western philosophy, Asian thought, and Native American traditions, as well as contemporary physics and evolutionary biology, Berry offers a new perspective that recasts our understanding of science, technology, politics, religion, ecology, and education. He shows us why it is important for us to respond to the Earth’s need for planetary renewal, and what we must do to break free of the “technological trance” that drives a misguided dream of progress. Only then, he suggests, can we foster mutually enhancing human-Earth relationships that can heal our traumatized global biosystem.",1578051355,9781578051359),Paperback,,264 pages,"

","The most profound and direct teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni's is called Dzogchen, or atiyoga, the Clear Light Great Perfection. This is the culmination of all nine vehicles that form the foundation path. Familiarity with its view, meditation and conduct brings unique results. In ""Lion's Gaze"", the authors Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, a highly qualified Lama and Dzogchen Master, and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, also a highly qualified Lama, Kama and Terma lineage holder and recognized expert in ancient Tantric literature, gather the teachings and reintroduce their essence in a timeless way. The first part of the book summarizes the history of Dzogchen and notes its lineage masters, illustrated with 15 beautiful portrait line drawings, and continues with explainations of the preliminary practices. The second section begins with ""Three Words That Strike The Crucial Point"", written by 8th century Vidyadhara Garab Dorje, the first human teacher of Dzogchen.

","Robert the Bruce- his rise from the ashes of defeatto the glowing triumph of BannockburnAt the opening of this stirring novel, the reader meets Bruce as a man broken in every way except in spirit. He has been excommunicated and is a fugitive from the English. With the exception of his wife, nobody has any faith in him and his vision of freedom. Indeed, the war-weary Scots seem long past caring.But from this desperate situation and in the face of apparently unbearable setbacks where he loses all but his life, Robert the Bruce rises and finally faces the English at the memorable battle of Bannockburn.""Nigel Tranter is no dry-as-dust historian, but his wide-ranging tremendous story is not all blood and fire. It has humour, colour and beauty and unexpected tenderness. It is a novel to remember""MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS""It's all stirring stuff""Glasgow evening times""... this is historical novel writing at its best... a book of consistently high standard of literary artistry . .. a very fine work indeed"" cork examiner",1899841105,9781899841103),Audio Cassette,,,"

","An idyllic Hawaiian wedding held the promise of a wonderful future for handsome, athletic Chris Northon, an airline pilot, a confirmed bachelor-turned-devoted family man; and Liysa, an acclaimed surf photographer, loving mother, and aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. But few, including Chris, had seen Liysa's other side -- her controlling behavior and dark moods, her insatiable hunger for money and property. And no one anticipated the fatal outcome of a family camping trip in an Oregon forest. Liysa soon revealed herself as a victim of domestic abuse that culminated at the campsite, where she shot Chris in self-defense. But crime scene evidence led detectives to wonder if Liysa was a killer, not a victim. Her controversial trial stunned all who thought they knew her. A lifetime of sociopathic manipulations and lies had been expertly hidden behind her façade of perfection -- as was her rage to destroy any obstacle to her ultimate happiness, even if it was the man she vowed to love forever.",0743410130,9780743410137),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","Maeve Binchy once again brings us an enchanting book full of the wit, warmth, and wisdom that have made her one of the most beloved and widely read writers at work today. When a new highway threatens to bypass the town of Rossmore and cut through Whitethorn Woods, everyone has a passionate opinion about whether the town will benefit or suffer. But young Father Flynn is most concerned with the fate of St. Ann's Well, which is set at the edge of the woods and slated for destruction. People have been coming to St. Ann's for generations to share their dreams and fears, and speak their prayers. Some believe it to be a place of true spiritual power, demanding protection; others think it's a mere magnet for superstitions, easily sacrificed. Not knowing which faction to favor, Father Flynn listens to all those caught up in the conflict, and these are the voices we hear in the stories of ""Whitethorn Woods""--men and women deciding between the traditions of the past and the promises of the future, ordinary people brought vividly to life by Binchy's generosity and empathy, and in the vivacity and surprise of her storytelling. Maeve Binchy is at the very top of her form in this irresistible tale.",0307265781,9780307265784),Hardcover,,339 pages,"

It is an ""autobiographical"" novel, the story being told in the first person by Colas, who reviews his fifty years of life, and describes all its joys and sorrows. The story is gay and humorous, and full of wise observations about life. --- ""Colas Breugnon is the jovial Burgundian, the lusty wood-carver, the practical joker always fond of his glass, the droll fellow. Before everything, Colas Breugnon is a free man. He loves his king, but only so long as the king leaves him his liberty; he loves his wife, but follows his own bent; he is on excellent terms with the priest of a neighboring parish, but never goes to church; he idolizes his children, but his vigorous individuality makes him unwilling to live with them. He is friendly with all, but subject to none; he is freer than the king; he has that sense of humor characteristic of the free spirit to whom the whole world belongs.",2253012130,9782253012139),,,242 pages,"

On his journey to enlightenment he learns how fragile the balance of life can be through the tragic story of his blind master, Soseki, and the love of his life, a French tightrope walker named Snow.

","Attending Alaska's Birds, author King's 60 year memoir, covers a dramatic period in Alaska's history, a time when the people increased five-fold to over 600 thousand. King arrived in Alaska in 1949 at the age of 21. He describes life as a pilot/game warden, a refuge manager, a flyway biologist and an expert at enumerating birds while whizzing over them in a small plane.  The story covers a series of accomplishments: Learning to fly in northern Alaska - Game law enforcement for the pre-statehood Alaska Game Commission - Banding 15 thousand ducks to assess a possible cost of the proposed Rampart Canyon Dam on the Yukon River - Establishing the first headquarters for the enormous Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge at the Eskimo village of Bethel - Flying the annual survey to provide a forecast for the number of ducks expected to be available for Pacific coast hunters each fall - Providing the first description of the one million seabirds that nest at Cape Newenham resulting in designation of a new National Wildlife Refuge - The first valid estimate of the number of Bald Eagles threatened by logging on Southeast Alaska's convoluted coast - Drafting the plan that resulted in 7 new waterfowl refuges covering 22 million acres - Planning and managing the first complete census of Alaska's Trumpeter Swans and - Experiences rearing rare waterfowl species on the edge of Juneau's tide flats.  This is a compelling narrative about Alaskan life, conservation issues, wild bird habits, history, geography, and personal adventure.",1425142435,9781425142438),Paperback,,470 pages,"

","The entire nation stopped and held its collective breath as word spread of the plight of the nine Pennsylvania coal miners who were trapped underground for 77 hours. Now, for the first time, the miners tell their own story--in a dramatic, riveting first-person account of their actions and emotions and of how they managed to make it through the traumatic accident and rescue. The men were below ground when water trapped in an adjacent mine burst through the wall of the new mine they were working. Scrambling to avoid the sluicing tide that rapidly rose in the narrow passageway, the crew knew they were in serious trouble. Moe, who was trapped on the other side of the raging stream, alone and away from the others, thought he would die then and there. However, in a heroic effort, Randly Fogle, crew chief, drove the scoop machinery straight into the flood and Moe managed to leap into it, and thus was carried to relative safety. Now all together, the miners moved to the best location they could find in the freezing-cold, still-rising water. They recount their fears, their prayers, their confessions to one another, and how they kept up their hope that they'd get out alive, while trying to decide how to drown with dignity. Meanwhile, we see the agony their wives, girlfriends, and families were going through, not knowing if they were living or dead. Once a resuce was imminent, the men reveal how they decided who would be the last man up. And they tell of their emotions upon finally touching solid ground and meeting their loved ones, whom they'd thought they would never see again. The successful rescue of the miners lifted the spirits of an entire nation. Now everyone can read the complete story of this harrowing incident--how these men and their families had the strength, courage, and faith to endure their incredible ordeal.",1401300553,9781401300555),Hardcover,,192 pages,"

Now retired and living in Mexico, she nearly dies herself when a sniper kills her boyfriend, the son of a local druglord, and while the boy's father vows vengeance, Rinker knows something he doesn't: The boy wasn't the target-she was-and now she is going to have to disappear to find the killer herself. The FBI and DEA draft Davenport to help track her down, and with his fiancie deep in wedding preparations, he's really just as happy to go-but he has no idea what he's getting into. For Rinker is as unpredictable as ever, and between her, her old bosses in the St. Louis mob, the Mexican druglord, and the combined, sometimes warring, forces of U.S. law enforcement, this is one case that will get more dangerous as it goes along. And when the crossfire comes, anyone standing in the middle won't stand a chance....Filled with the rich characterization and exceptional drama that are his hallmarks, Mortal Prey proves that John Sandford just keeps getting better.",0425189864,9780425189863),Paperback,,424 pages,"

","A brilliant, elegant argument for spirituality without God Can we do without religion? Can we have ethics without God? Is there such thing as ""atheist spirituality""? In this powerful book, the internationally bestselling author Andr Comte-Sponville presents a philosophical exploration of atheism-and comes to some startling conclusions. According to Comte-Sponville, we have allowed the concept of spirituality to become intertwined with religion, and thus have lost touch with the nature of a true spiritual existence. In order to change this, however, we need not reject the ancient traditions and values that are part of our heritage; rather, we must rethink our relationship to these values and ask ourselves whether their significance comes from the existence of a higher power or simply the human need to connect to one another and the universe. Comte-Sponville offers rigorous, reasoned arguments that take both Eastern and Western philosophical traditions into account, and through his clear, concise, and often humorous prose, he offers a convincing treatise on a new form of spiritual life.",1429579846,9781429579841),ebook,,224 pages,"

She lives with her father in a barn, as her mother often gets bored and leaves them for months at a time.Everybody loves Cornelia and wants to be just like her, and nobody more so than Ruthie. Cornelia hardly knows Ruthie is alive, but she tries to be kind sometimes.And then things begin to change. ""Rich"" Cornelia's father gets sick and cannot work, and Cornelia's mother has to sell the house and take a job. World War II starts, and suddenly Ruthie's father sells a once-worthless field for a fine sum of money, and her mother comes home to share in it. The two girls, once so unequal, are pretty much in the same boat now, and they become friends.Then the war, which had unexpectedly given Ruthie so much, threatens to take away the one thing she wants most of all. Not even Cornelia's coveted friendship is enough to make up for it, and the heartsick girl runs away. Alone in the woods, Ruthie, who has never had much, learns to accept the loss of everything, and long before her story is over, readers will discover that this wistful heroine has won a place in their hearts, much as she wins solutions to her most pressing problems.",0440496713,9780440496717),Paperback,,104 pages,"

","Throughout history, the natural human inclination to accumulate social power has led to growth and scale increases that benefit the few at the expense of the many. John Bodley looks at global history through the lens of power and scale theory, and draws on history, economics, anthropology, and sociology to demonstrate how individuals have been the agents of social change, not social classes. Filled with tables and data to support his argument, this book considers how increases in scale necessarily lead to an increasingly small elite gaining disproportionate power, making democratic control more difficult to achieve and maintain.",0765609851,9780765609854),Paperback,,297 pages,"

","Orson Scott Card has the distinction of having swept both the Hugo and Nebula awards in two consecutive years with his amazing novels Ender’s Game and Speaker for the Dead. For a body of work that ranges from science fiction to nonfiction to plays, Card has been recognized as an author who provides vivid, colorful glimpses between the world we know and worlds we can only imagine.In a peaceful, prosperous African American neighborhood in Los Angeles, Mack Street is a mystery child who has somehow found a home. Discovered abandoned in an overgrown park, raised by a blunt-speaking single woman, Mack comes and goes from family to family–a boy who is at once surrounded by boisterous characters and deeply alone. But while Mack senses that he is different from most, and knows that he has strange powers, he cannot possibly understand how unusual he is until the day he sees, in a thin slice of space, a narrow house. Beyond it is a backyard–and an entryway into an extraordinary world stretching off into an exotic distance of geography, history, and magic.Passing through the skinny house that no one else can see, Mack is plunged into a realm where time and reality are skewed, a place where what Mack does and sees seem to have strange affects in the “real world” of concrete, cars, commerce, and conflict. Growing into a tall, powerful young man, pursuing a forbidden relationship, and using Shakespeare’s Midsummer’s Night Dream as a guide into the vast, timeless fantasy world, Mack becomes a player in an epic drama. Understanding this drama is Mack’s challenge. His reward, if he can survive the trip, is discovering not only who he really is . . . but why he exists.Both a novel of constantly surprising entertainment and a tale of breathtaking literary power, Magic Street is a masterwork from a supremely gifted, utterly original American writer–a novel that uses realism and fantasy to delight, challenge, and satisfy on the most profound levels.From the Hardcover edition.",0345416902,9780345416902),Paperback,,416 pages,"

Effortlessly, the assassin slips through the police's fingers, and his absence sparks a blaze of accusations about who ordered the hit.Seated at a nearby table, reporter Nick Daniels is conducting a once-in-a-lifetime interview with a legendary baseball bad-boy. In the chaos, he accidentally captures a key piece of evidence that lands him in the middle of an all-out war between Italian and Russian mafia forces. NYPD captains, district attorneys, mayoral candidates, media kingpins, and one shockingly beautiful magazine editor are all pushing their own agendas - on both sides of the law.Back off - or die - is the clear message Nick receives as he investigates for a story of his own.

Indeed, the experience of nature was, and still may be, a critical component of human physical, emotional, intellectual, and even moral development. Yet scientific knowledge of the significance of natureduring the different stages of childhood is sparse. This book provides scientificinvestigations and thought-provoking essays on children and nature.Children andNature incorporates research from cognitive science, developmental psychology, ecology, education, environmental studies, evolutionary psychology, politicalscience, primatology, psychiatry, and social psychology. The authors examine theevolutionary significance of nature during childhood; the formation of children'sconceptions, values, and sympathies toward the natural world; how contact withnature affects children's physical and mental development; and the educational andpolitical consequences of the weakened childhood experience of nature in modernsociety.",0262611759,9780262611756),Paperback,,370 pages,"

Kennedy. The pictures document that we have lived in a violent age, showing the brutalities of war, racism, and despotism. But the Pulitzer photojournalists also recorded tender and compassionate moments, as in Brian Lanker's pictures of joyous parents at the birth of their child, or Scott Shaw's photographs of the rescue of a little girl trapped in a well.

","Alexander McCall Smith, best-selling author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has turned his hand to humour. The delightful result is a creation of comic genius. For in the unnaturally tall form of Professor Doctor Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, we are invited to meet a memorable character whose sublime insouciance is a blend of the cultivated pomposity of Frasier Crane and of Inspecteur Clouseau's hapless gaucherie. Von Igelfeld inhabits the rarefied world of the Institute of Romance Philology at Regensburg, a world he shares with his equally tall and equally ridiculous colleagues, Professors Florianus Prinzel and Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer. Their unlikely adventures are described in three deliciously funny instalments: Portuguese Irregular Verbs, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs and At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances.",0349118507,9780349118505),Paperback,,394 pages,"

","For the fugitive settlers of Jijo, it is truly the beginning of the end. As starships fill the skies, the threat of genocide hangs over the planet that once peacefully sheltered six bands of sapient beings. Now the human settlers of Jijo and their alien neighbors must make heroic—and terrifying—choices. A scientist must turn against the benefactors she's been trained to love. A heretic must rally believers for a cause he never shared. And four youngsters find that what started as a simple adventure—imitating exploits in Earthling books by Verne and Twain—leads them to the dark abyss of mystery. Meanwhile, the Streaker, with her fugitive dolphin crew, arrives at last on Jijo in a desperate search for refuge. Yet what the crew finds instead is a secret hidden since the galaxies first spawned intelligence—a secret that could mean salvation for the planet and its inhabitants … or their ultimate annihilation.",0553577778,9780553577778),Paperback,,644 pages,"

","When Luke Quintain's fiancee dumped him, Catherine Lang understood immediately that she was the perfect solution to his problem. Leggy, flame haired and wise beyond her years, she decided that he should marry her instead.But even though Luke needed a wife by his thirty-sixth birthday or he would lose his inheritance, he had to say ""No!"" Well, that was what he tried to say, but somehow Cat left with a ring on her finger and a wedding date on her calendar. And Luke could only curse his grandfather's positively medieval blackmailing scheme...and count the seconds till the wedding night.Cat, of course, knows her own mind -- and her own heart -- and she wants Luke. Meanwhile, Luke is wondering how long this will play out, and hoping that it might be a little longer with each passing day. The problem is, he's quite capable of doing something very stupid -- like falling for Cat.Because sometimes love just doesn't take no for an answer.",1551666774,9781551666778),Mass Market Paperback,,384 pages,"

","When Crispin, Lord Cavratt, thoroughly and scandalously kisses a serving woman in the garden of a country inn, he assumes the encounter will be of no consequence. But he couldn't be more mistaken--the maid is not only a lady of birth, she's the niece of a very large, exceptionally angry gentlemen, who claims Crispin has compromised his niece beyond redemption. The dismayed young lord has no choice but to marry Miss Catherine Thorndale, who lacks both money and refinement and assumes all men are as vicious as her guardian uncle.Trapped between an unwanted marriage and a hasty annulment, which would leave his reputation tainted and Catherine's utterly ruined, Crispin begins guiding his wife's transformation from a socially petrified country girl to a lady of society. Their unfolding relationship reveals encouraging surprises for both of them, and privately each of them wonders if theirs may become a true marriage of the heart. But their hopes are dashed when forces conspire to split asunder what fate has granted. As a battle of wits escalates into a life-threatening confrontation, will it be possible for Crispin and Catherine to live happily ever after?",1608611752,9781608611751),Paperback,,252 pages,"

","A young man in his teens is transported from our world to a magical realm that contains seven levels of reality. Very quickly transformed by magic into a grown man of heroic proportions, he takes the name Able and sets out on a quest to find the sword that has been promised to him, a sword he will get from a dragon, the one very special blade that will help him fulfill his life ambition to become a knight and a true hero.Inside, however, Able remains a boy, and he must grow in every sense to survive the dangers and delights that lie ahead in encounters with giants, elves, wizards, and dragons. His adventure will conclude in the second volume of The Wizard Knight, The Wizard.With this new series, Wolfe not only surpasses all the most popular genre writers of the last three decades, he takes on the legends of the past century, in a work that will be favorably compared with the best of J. R. R. Tolkien, E. R. Eddison, Mervyn Peake, and T. H. White. This is a book---and a series---for the ages, from perhaps the greatest living writer in (or outside) the fantasy genre.",0765347016,9780765347015),Paperback,,544 pages,"

","Several years have passed since the demise of Hanish Mein. Corinn Akaran rules with an iron grip on the Known World's many races. She hones her skills in sorcery by studying The Song of Elenet and she dotes on her young son, Aaden — Hanish's child — raising him to be her successor. Mena Akaran, still the warrior princess she became fighting the eagle goddess Maeben, has been battling the monsters released by the Santoth's corrupted magic. In her hunt she discovers a creature wholly unexpected, one that awakens emotions in her she has long suppressed. And Dariel Akaran, once a brigand of the Outer Isles, has devoted his labors to rebuilding the ravaged empire brick by brick. Each of the Akaran royals is finding his or her way in the postwar world. But the queen's peace is difficult to maintain, and things are about to change.When the league brings news of upheavals in the Other Lands, Corinn sends Dariel across the Gray Slopes as her emissary. From the moment he sets foot on that distant continent, he finds a chaotic swirl of treachery, ancient grudges, intrigue, and exoticism. He comes face-to-face with the slaves his empire has long sold into bondage. His arrival ignites a firestorm that once more puts the Known World in threat of invasion. A massive invasion.

","It all started when Douglas Adams demolished planet Earth in order to make way for an intergalactic expressway–and then invited everyone to thumb a ride on a comical cosmic road trip with the likes of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, and the other daft denizens of deep space immortalized in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. Adams made the universe a much funnier place to inhabit and forever changed the way we think about towels, extraterrestrial poetry, and especially the number 42. And then, too soon, he was gone.Just who was this impossibly tall Englishman who wedded science fiction and absurdist humor to create the multimillion-selling five-book “trilogy” that became a cult phenomenon read round the world? Even if you’ve dined in the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, you’ve been exposed to only a portion of the offbeat, endearing, and irresistible Adams mystique. Have you met the only official unofficial member of Monty Python’s Flying Circus? The very first person to purchase a Macintosh computer? The first (and thus far only) author to play a guitar solo onstage with Pink Floyd? Adams was also the writer so notorious for missing deadlines that he had to be held captive in a hotel room under the watchful eye of his editor; the creator of the epic computer game Starship Titanic; and a globetrotting wildlife crusader.A longtime friend of the author, Nick Webb reveals many quirks and contradictions: Adams as the high-tech-gadget junkie and lavish gift giver . . .irrepressible ham and painfully timid soul . . . gregarious conversationalist and brooding depressive . . . brilliant intellect and prickly egotist. Into the brief span of forty-nine years, Douglas Adams exuberantly crammed more lives than the most resilient cat–while still finding time and energy to pursue whatever side projects captivated his ever-inquisitive mind. By turns touching, tongue-in-cheek, and not at all timid about telling the warts-and-all truth, Wish You Were Here is summation as celebration– a look back at a life well worth the vicarious reliving, and studded with anecdote, droll comic incident, and heartfelt insight as its subject’s own unforgettable tales of cosmic wanderlust. For the countless fans of Douglas Adams and his unique and winsome world, here is a wonderful postcard: to be read, reread, and treasured for the memories it bears.From the Hardcover edition.",0345476514,9780345476517),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","“Put a bow around the woman you want for me, so I’ll know.”Associate Pastor Dr. Mark Countryman is a recent transplant to North Fort Myers, Florida. Although it’s a paradise for some, Dr. Countryman has never felt more alone. As his fortieth birthday approaches, he reevaluates his past relationships and prays that God will guard his heart so it will not be broken again. If only there was a way he could be sure of God’s will.“God says that a man is not meant to live alone always.”As a child, Shelley watched her mother lose the battle against breast cancer. In her late teens, she survived a major hurricane with her father while living in Southwest Florida. Now twenty-five, Shelley Roberts is a furniture repairwoman who believes in being prepared for every contingency while enjoying life and seizing the moment.A random encounter throws these two people into each other’s lives. Soon after, Shelley is assigned to do some work at Mark’s church. As they spend more time together, a relationship slowly begins to blossom, though whether they’re “friends” or “more” is something neither of them is certain of.While growing closer to Mark, Shelley encourages him to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season—something she had to learn to do some years before. Though a woman of faith, her life’s experiences have taught her that preparation is necessary. She is enthusiastic in this belief, even when Mark tries to get her to relax and have faith in God’s protection.Their beliefs will be tested when hurricane season begins in earnest and a storm grows in strength as it nears the Florida Peninsula.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Praise for An Unexpected Woman:Mark and Shelley complement each other well. She loosens him up a bit and he tempers her. In the beginning Shelley keeps a professional distance since Mark is considered a client. Mark has some reservations regarding their age difference and because of Shelley’s delight in and insistence on their friendship. The progression of their relationship is sweet and believably Christian based. - IvyD for Manic Readers* * *One of my favourite things is when Mark and Shelley get cheeky with each other. Each knows how to keep the other from getting in a funk. And the flirting is awesome. There are some great romantic moments that are perfectly in keeping with godly conduct. - Jess Molly on Goodreads * * *The author also picks up on themes of family and friendship, as well as the need to compromise in any relationship.Overall, this was a satisfying read. Much in the tone of a Karen Kingsbury novel, this book should appeal to those who love Christian romances. - Sandra for myfictionnook.com",144215201X,9781442152014),Paperback,,158 pages,"

It s not going to be easy, when all he wants to say is - Yes!Andrew likes sex. If someone he s attracted to wants to have sex with him, he's not going to say no to them. That's not a character flaw, it s just common sense.Stephen seems to think otherwise. He's sure Andrew is incapable of saying no to a cheap thrill. But, at the same time, he's more than happy to provide Andrew with the prefect opportunity to prove him wrong.Andrew has no doubt that he can say no to everything the younger man offers him for the next twelve hours, and that's all he needs to do to win their bet. He's also quite looking forward to cutting the would-be dominant down to size in the process.

","Success hasn't spoiled screenwriter Lou Calabrese -- it's just given her a taste for luxury. And it's put her in some bizarre situations -- like in a helicopter en route to the wilds of Alaska, sharing too-close quarters with the last man she wants to be with: Jack Townsend! Once a sexy nobody whom Lou helped make a somebody, Jack's just been dumped by a high-profile Hollywood airhead -- who's eloped with Lou's longtime love! So what else could go wrong?Well...Their pilot could try to shoot the most adored man in America. They could crash land in the icy, mountainous middle of nowhere. And at the worst possible moment, when survival should be their only consideration, Jack could start wondering if maybe he wasn't a wee bit too hasty for not giving this sexy screenwriter a second look -- while Lou could start noticing how superstar Jack is kind of hot after all ...",0060085444,9780060085445),Paperback,,357 pages,"

Stalked by a handsome fairy who claims she is like him, demonkind, Rae thinks maybe it was a mistake breaking the rules by going over the Wall into demon territory. Plunged into a world of dark magics, fierce creatures, and ritual sacrifice, she is charged with a guarding a magical amulet. The changes to her mind and body are startling, but rather than accept her purpose she struggles against who she is destined to be. Throw in a big lust for a vampire who can't keep his hands off her, and life starts to get complicated. Rae is forced to make the ultimate choice: to live and die human, or embrace her birth-right and wield magics that could turn her into something wicked, a force of nature nothing can control.

","2014 ACKER AWARD WINNERAnyone who cares to understand the literary and cultural ferment of America in the later twentieth century must be familiar with the writings and lives of those scruffy bohemians known as the Beat Generation.In this highly entertaining work, Bill Morgan, the country’s leading authority on the movement and a man who personally knew most of the Beats, narrates the history of these writers as primarily a social group of friends, tracing their origins together during the World War II years to the full blossoming of their notoriety in the late 1950s to their profound influence on the social upheaval of the 1960s. Indeed, it is impossible to comprehend the sixties without first grasping the importance of the social ripples set in motion by the Beats a decade earlier.Although their prose and poetry varied in style and for the most part did not represent a genuine literary movement, the Beats, through their words and nonconformist lives, collectively posed a challenge to the staid and complacent America of the postwar years. They believed in free expression, opposing all censorship; they dabbled in free love; they practiced Eastern philosophy, leading to an embrace in America of alternative forms of spirituality; sooner than others, they watched with dismay the increasingly heavy hand of military and corporate culture in our national life; they embraced the aspirations, as well as the lingo, of urbanized black Americans. They believed in the liberating influence of hallucinogenic drugs.In short, the Beats were thoroughly American in their love of individual freedom. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that J. Edgar Hoover described them in 1960 as one of the three greatest threats to American security (after communism and intellectual ""eggheads"").The story that Bill Morgan tells has less to do with sociology than with social mingling. He traces the closely knit friendships of the Beat luminaries Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and the small army of other names. Although Kerouac, author of the much loved novel On the Road, was the most famous of the Beat writers, it was Ginsberg, Morgan contends, who resided at the center of the group and for more than two decades provided it with cohesion and a sense of direction.The Beats were not saints. They were sexually irresponsible, undependable in marriage (the movement could in fact fairly be described as misogynistic); they did too many drugs and consumed too much booze; the very quality that characterized their lives and writings—a fervent belief in spontaneity—destroyed some friendships. Indeed, Morgan’s story begins with a murder in New York’s Riverside Park in 1944.Bill Morgan has provided a sweeping, indispensable story about these discontented free spirits. We watch their peripatetic lives, their sexual misadventures, their ambivalent response to fame. We are reminded above all that while their personal lives may have not have been holy, their typewriters and their lasting words very much were.",1416597204,9781416597209),ebook,,320 pages,"

This was Nausicaa, which would make Miyazaki's reputation as much as his 11 films and TV shows.Set in the far future, Nausicaa visualizes an Earth radically changed by ecological disaster. Strange human kingdoms survive at the edge of the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous fungal forest. Nausicaa, a gentle young princess, has a telepathic bond with the giant mutated insects of this dystopia. Her task is to negotiate peace between kingdoms battling over the last of the world's precious natural resources.Nausicaa took Miyazaki 12 years to create, in part because he worked with few or no assistants, doing both the writing and drawing using a meticulously detailed style that critics have compared to the work of the French artist Moebius.",1569310963,9781569310960),Paperback,Perfect Collection,264 pages,"

And when they don't, we find ourselves in a new place---a place we haven't been before, a place we never would have imagined on our own. It is the difficult and the unexpected, and maybe even the tragic, that opens us up and frees us to see things in new ways. Many of the most significant moments in our lives come not because it all went right but because it all fell apart. Suffering does that. It hurts, but it also creates.
