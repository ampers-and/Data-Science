","It is 1863, but not the one it should be. Time has veered wildly off course, and now the first moves are being made that will lead to a devastating world war and the fall of the British Empire. Caught in a tangled web of cause, effect, and inevitability, little does Burton realize that the stakes are far higher than even he suspects. A final confrontation comes in the mist-shrouded Mountains of the Moon, in war- torn Africa of 1914, and in Green Park, London, where, in the year 1840, Burton must face the man responsible for altering time: Spring Heeled Jack! Burton and Swinburne's third adventure is filled with eccentric steam-driven technology, grotesque characters, and bizarre events, completing the three-volume story arc begun in The Strange Affair of Spring Heeled Jack and The Curious Case of the Clockwork Man.",1616145358,9781616145354),Paperback,,399 pages,"

","An exhaustive, soul-searching memoir, Bill Clinton's My Life is a refreshingly candid look at the former president as a son, brother, teacher, father, husband, and public figure. Clinton painstakingly outlines the history behind his greatest successes and failures, including his dedication to educational and economic reform, his war against a ""vast right-wing operation"" determined to destroy him, and the ""morally indefensible"" acts for which he was nearly impeached. My Life is autobiography as therapy--a personal history written by a man trying to face and banish his private demons. Clinton approaches the story of his youth with gusto, sharing tales of giant watermelons, nine-pound tumors, a charging ram, famous mobsters and jazz musicians, and a BB gun standoff. He offers an equally energetic portrait of American history, pop culture, and the evolving political landscape, covering the historical events that shaped his early years (namely the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr. and JFK) and the events that shaped his presidency (Waco, Bosnia, Somalia). What makes My Life remarkable as a political memoir is how thoroughly it is infused with Clinton's unassuming, charmingly pithy voice: I learned a lot from the stories my uncle, aunts, and grandparents told me: that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged only by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain. However, that same voice might tire readers as Clinton applies his penchant for minute details to a distractible laundry list of events, from his youth through the years of his presidency. Not wanting to forget a single detail that might help account for his actions, Clinton overdoes it--do we really need to know the name of his childhood barber? But when Clinton sticks to the meat of his story--recollections about Mother, his abusive stepfather, Hillary, the campaign trail, and Kenneth Starr--the veracity of emotion and Kitchen Confidential-type revelations about ""what it is like to be President"" make My Life impossible to put down. To Clinton, ""politics is a contact sport,"" and while he claims that My Life is not intended to make excuses or assign blame, it does portray him as a fighter whose strategy is to ""take the first hit, then counterpunch as hard as I could."" While My Life is primarily a stroll through Clinton's memories, it is also a scathing rebuke--a retaliation against his detractors, including Kenneth Starr, whose ""mindless search for scandal"" protected the guilty while ""persecuting the innocent"" and distracted his Administration from pressing international matters (including strikes on al Qaeda). Counterpunch indeed. At its core, My Life is a charming and intriguing if flawed book by an equally intriguing and flawed man who had his worst failures and humiliations made public. Ultimately, the man who left office in the shadow of scandal offers an honest and open account of his life, allowing readers to witness his struggle to ""drain the most out of every moment"" while maintaining the character with which he was raised. It is a remarkably intimate, persuasive look at the boy he was, the President he became, and man he is today. --Daphne Durham",140003003X,9781400030033),Paperback,,969 pages,"

","The term ""liberalism"" comes from the Latin word liber meaning ""free."" Mises defines liberalism as ""the liberal doctrine of the harmony of the rightly understood interests of all members of a free society founded on the principle of private ownership of the means of production."" This book presents the theoretical and practical arguments for liberalism in the classical tradition.The foundation of liberalism, Mises says, rests on an understanding and appreciation of private property, social cooperation, the freedom idea, ethics and morality, democracy, and the legitimate role of government. Liberalism is not a political party; it is a system of social organization. The liberal program aims at securing equality under law and freedom of opportunity for everyone to make their own choices and decisions, so long as they do not interfere with the equal rights of others; it offers no special privileges to anyone. Under liberalism, the role of government would be limited to protecting the lives, property, and freedom of its citizens to pursue their own ends and goals. Mises is more specific here than elsewhere in applying the liberal program to economic policy, domestic and foreign. Also in this book, Mises contrasts liberalism with other conceivable systems of social organization such as socialism, communism, and fascism.Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.Bettina Bien Greaves is a former resident scholar, trustee, and longtime staff member of the Foundation for Economic Education. She has written and lectured extensively on topics of free market economics. Her articles have appeared in such journals as Human Events, Reason, and The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty. A student of Mises, Greaves has become an expert on his work in particular and that of the Austrian School of economics in general. She has translated several Mises monographs, compiled an annotated bibliography of his work, and edited collections of papers by Mises and other members of the Austrian School.",English,English,Paperback,,203 pages,"

","On a recent Vancouver Sunday afternoon, a young man stumbles upon a secret sport invented more than a century before, at the birth of his city. Thus begins The Man Game, Lee Henderson’s epic tale of loved requited and not, that crosses the contemporary and historical in an extravagant, anarchistic retelling of the early days of a pioneer town on the edge of the known world. In 1886, out of the smouldering ashes of the great fire that destroyed much of the city,Molly Erwagen—former vaudeville performer—arrives from Toronto with her beloved husband, Samuel, to start a new life. Meanwhile, Litz and Pisk, two lumberjacks exiled after the fire, and blamed for having started it, are trying to clear their names. Before long, they’ve teamed up with Molly to invent a new sport that will change the course of that fledgling city’s history.",067091147X,9780670911479),Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","Though both gorgeous, the two Rodgers sisters couldn't be more different. Hennesey, a brilliant straight-A student, is soon off to college on a full scholarship. She's in a strong relationship with Rafe, a recently released convict who's trying to turn his life around after being unjustly jailed. He took a drug rap for his old friend Smoke, who has since become the most ruthless drug dealer in Chicago. Rafe wants nothing more to do with his old friends -- especially when he falls for Hennesey.  On the other hand, Alizé is perfectly comfortable relying on her undeniable sex appeal to get what she wants. When Livvy, the girls' mother, announces that they have to move out of her apartment because she is getting a smaller place to save up money and go back to school, Alizé panics as she is in desperate need of some money of her own. She and her girlfriends come up with an outrageous plan to score some fast cash -- persuading the men with fat pockets they meet at clubs to take the girls to a hotel and then drugging them and making off with their wallets and jewelry. Unfortunately for Alizé, one of their first victims is none other than Smoke, Rafe's old buddy. Once robbed, he's bent on revenge -- and the violent chain of events that follow will change the Rodgers family forever.",074346480X,9780743464802),Paperback,,320 pages,"

That search takes him to the immigrant and literary bohemias of 1950s London, to a facile and unsatisfying career as a writer, and at last to a decaying Portugese colony in East Africa, where he finds a happiness he will then be compelled to betray.

","What began as Erin Siegal's 2009 Master's project as a Fellow at the Stabile Center for Investigative Reporting at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism evolved into a complex investigation of $30,000 U.S. dollars, four Guatemalan ""orphans,"" one nonprofit evangelical Christian adoption agency, a family-run child-trafficking ring, one infant cut from her unconscious mother's womb, two tiny missing sisters, and a nine-member Tennessee family who believed wholeheartedly in Christian love and faith-until the dark side of international adoption shattered their trust. Siegal reveals the heart wrenching story of how one poor Guatemalan woman, Mildred Alvarado, ultimately reunited with her kidnapped daughters against all odds-and how the American housewife slated to adopt one of those children, Elizabeth Emanuel, accidentally became a reformer dedicated to an ethical adoption system.FINDING FERNANDA sheds light on the highly politicized landscape of Guatemala's adoption industry, a multi-million dollar trade that was both highly profitable and barely regulated. Children have been stolen, sold, and placed as orphans in corrupt international adoptions to well-intentioned Western parents ever since the industry began in the 1980s, yet the governments of Guatemala and the United States repeatedly proved unwilling and incapable of regulating the baby trade. Of the 100,000 children adopted into the United States between 2004 and 2008, over 20,000 were Guatemalan.With help of documents obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests, leaked emails, and key sources inside both the Guatemalan and U.S. governments, Siegal's research traces one compelling case of corruption in detail from start to finish. Along the way, the mechanisms surrounding ""orphan laundering"" are illuminated, including the roles of baby-finders, caretakers, judges, government officials, and more. This cadena perpetua, or perpetual chain, involves everyone from Guatemalan judges to U.S. embassy officials. Provocative as it is captivating, FINDING FERNANDA an overdue, unprecedented look at how adoption corruption occurs-- and a poignant, riveting human story about the power of hope, faith, and determination.",English,English,Paperback,,322 pages,"

","For more than fifty years Lucille Ball has been television's most recognizable and beloved face. As Lucy Ricardo she was the ultimate screwball housewife, getting herself into and out of scrapes with unmatched comic finesse. Indeed, she was so funny, and so central to the cultural landscape, that we often overlook Ball's role in shaping that turf: as producer of her own show and a cofounder of a major studio, she was a pioneer, rewriting the rules and forging new paths for women in the boardroom and on the sound stage. In Ball of Fire, Stefan Kanfer goes beyond the icon to examine the difficult life and enduring work of the most influential woman in modern American comedy. Kanfer traces the arc of her career from its unlikely beginnings in a lonely and desolate childhood in upstate New York. There she discovered that making people laugh could ease the pains of a fragmented family life. But she was more than amusing. She was also beautiful, and when Lucy's adolescent attempts to crack Broadway ended in failure, she became a runway model and on a fluke, journeyed out to California to be an extra in one film. That led to another, and another, and another bottom-of-the-bill movie, until she became, in her own words, ""The Queen of the B's."" Ball of Fire tracks Lucy's pursuit of the superstardom that eluded her on the big screen and follows the actress through a series of disappointing affairs and sorrows until she meets a Cuban conga drummer six years her junior, and falls headlong in love with Desi Arnaz. Working with her husband, Lucille Ball becomes a different kind of comic artist in a program called ""I Love Lucy,"" the show that is still running in more than eighty countries aroundthe globe. Taking us through the development of television both as technology and cultural phenomenon, Kanfer chronicles the difficult birth of the sitcom that changed the world. He details the early executive meetings, the rocky first productions, the shaky first weeks and the unpredicted triumph. We see all of Lucy's behind-the-scenes battles for creative control of the show; her surprising confrontation with the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was discovered that she had once registered to vote as a Communist; her groundbreaking on-air pregnancy; and a series of in-depth analyses of the classic scenes and Chaplinesque slapstick that guarantee her a permanent place in the pantheon of American comedy. Finally, we see the aftermath of her hard-won fame: the turbulent marriage and painful split from Desi, the man she never stopped loving; her second marriage; and her sad last years out of the limelight and away from the applause. This is the first biography to examine the legendary Lucille Ball in all her many dimensions: her personal struggles and the torments that forged a comic genius; and, at last, her posthumous influence on television comedy, on feminist scholars and cultural critics, and on the public at large. Ball of Fire is the definitive biography Lucy fans have been waiting for.",0375413154,9780375413155),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

And forget about Alexander Graham Bell inventing the telephone, Italian American tinkerer Antonio Meucci bested him by at least four years in transmitting voices over a wire.Nearly all historians have conceded that the Vikings made it to America's shores 500 years before Columbus. But did you know he was likely to have been preceded by two Chinese explorers the first in A.D. 458?Most history books say that successive waves of invading barbarians caused the Roman Empire to crumble, but actually that mighty power was brought low by a much humbler intruder: the mosquito.Legend has it that Cleopatra was a ravishing beauty, but all the evidence points to a woman who was plain, short, and dumpy albeit one with a charming personality. And she couldn't have killed herself with an asp because it was unknown in Egypt at the time. What she probably used was a cobra.Lucrezia Borgia, on the other hand, has probably been unjustly maligned by history writers because of her family's notorious reputation for there is no evidence at all that she ever poisoned anyone.Other stories often dismissed as unreliable folklore may very well be authentic. For centuries, the faithful have venerated the bones in a coffin in Padua, Italy, as those of the gospel writer Luke. Now, DNA testing shows that they are likely to be right.

","Lust brings out the liar in everyone. Every erection has Pinocchio written up and down its length—yes, everybody wants to be REAL, a real boy, an honest woman, unafraid and upright—but then desire, the ultimate honesty, does us in. Desire doesn't give a whit about shame. Our secrets, our exaggerations and distractions, it's all just a lot of twisting in the wind as far as sex is concerned—what we want WILL come out. ""Is our sexuality a basic, good, and precious thing that somehow became terribly misunderstood? Or is there something really evil out there in Sex Land that attaches itself to our libidos and is only held back by vigilance and caution?"" asks Susie Bright in her bestselling book The Sexual State of the Union. Bright pushes the borders of propriety until they blur and become irrelevant in the face of our inherent need to touch and be touched. With candor and passion, Susie Bright proves that sexual knowledge can indeed be salvation and inspiration.",0684838508,9780684838502),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Professors Fischl and Paul explain law school exams in ways no one has before, all with an eye toward improving the reader's performance. The book begins by describing the difference between educational cultures that praise students for ""right answers"" and the law school culture that rewards nuanced analysis of ambiguous situations in which more than one approach may be correct. Enormous care is devoted to explaining precisely how and why legal analysis frequently produces such perplexing situations. But the authors don't stop with mere description. Instead, Getting to Maybe teaches how to excel on law school exams by showing the reader how legal analysis can be brought to bear on examination problems. The book contains hints on studying and preparation that go well beyond conventional advice. The authors also illustrate how to argue both sides of a legal issue without appearing wishy-washy or indecisive. Above all, the book explains why exam questions may generate feelings of uncertainty or doubt about correct legal outcomes and how the student can turn these feelings to his or her advantage. In sum, although the authors believe that no exam guide can substitute for a firm grasp of substantive material, readers who devote the necessary time to learning the law will find this book an invaluable guide to translating learning into better exam performance.",0890897603,9780890897607),Paperback,,348 pages,"

","The Shift—a companion book to the movie of the same name—illustrates how and why to make the move from ambition to meaning. Such a shift eliminates our feelings of separateness, illuminates our spiritual connectedness, and involves moving from the ego-directed morning into the afternoon of life where everything is primarily influenced by purpose.As we contemplate leaving the morning of our life, where ego has played a commanding role, and entering the afternoon (and evening), where meaning and purpose replace ambition and struggle, we may encounter unexpected occurrences that accompany this new direction. It’s almost a universal law that we’ll experience a fall of some kind. Yet these falls or low points provide the energy we need to move away from ego and into a life of meaning and purpose.The Shift doesn’t mean that we lose our drive and ambition; it signifies that we become ambitious about something new. We make a commitment to living a life based on experiencing meaning and feeling purposeful, rather than never-ending demands and false promises that are the trademark of the ego’s agenda.As Dr. Wayne W. Dyer so eloquently reveals in these pages, we all have the choice to shift our lives from ambition to meaning . . . and thereby complete our return to the Source that created us.",English,English,Hardcover,,144 pages,"

Dall'Italia a Mosca a Hollywood, tra balere, viaggi clandestini oltrefrontiera e incontri di pugilato, una folla di protagonisti, spinti da una corrente che li travolge e li supera, si muove verso uno sbocco ignoto. Nuovi eretici, ex partigiani, contrabbandieri, narcotrafficanti, agenti segreti, figli in cerca di un padre si muovono e si sfiorano, inconsapevoli pedine di un grande disegno.

Four months later, unexpected events would trap Simon alone on his boat, frozen in ice 100 miles from the nearest settlement, with the long polar night stretching into darkness for months to come.  With his world circumscribed by screaming blizzards and marauding polar bears and his only companion a kittten named Halifax, Simon withstands months of crushing loneliness, sudden blindness, and private demons. Trapped in a boat buried beneath the drifting snow, he struggles through the perpertual darkness toward a spiritual awakening and an understanding of the forces that conspired to bring him there. He emerges five months later a transformed man.  Simon's powerful, triumphant story combines the suspense of ""Into Thin Air"" with a crystalline, lyrical prose to explore the hypnotic draw of one of the earth's deepest and most dangerous wildernesses.",1840183608,9781840183603),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","A memoir of astonishing power–the true story of a middle-class, middle-aged man who fell into the Inferno of the American prison system, and what he has to do to survive.It is your worst nightmare. You wake up in an 8' x 6' concrete-and-steel cell designated ""Suicide Watch #3."" The cell is real. Jimmy Lerner, formerly a suburban husband and father, and corporate strategic planner and survivor, is about to become a prison ""fish,"" or green new arrival. Taken to a penitentiary in the Nevada desert to begin serving a twelve-year term for voluntary manslaughter, this once nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn ends up sharing a claustrophobic cell with Kansas, a hugely muscled skinhead with a swastika engraved on his neck and a serious set of issues. And if he dares complain, the guards will bluntly tell him, ""You got nothing coming.""Bringing us into a world of petty corruption, racial strife, and crank-addicted neo-Nazis, Jimmy Lerner gives us a fish’s progress: a brash, compelling, and darkly comic story peopled with characters who are at various times funny, violent, and surprisingly tender. His rendering of prison language is mesmerizingly vivid and exact, and his search for a way not simply to survive but to craft a new way to live, in the most unpropitious of circumstances, is a tale filled with resilience, dignity, and a profound sense of the absurd. In the book’s climax, we learn just what demonic set of circumstances–a compound of bad luck and worse judgment–led him to the lethal act of self-defense that landed him in a circle of an American hell.Electrifying, unforgettable, bracingly cynical, and perceptive, You Got Nothing Coming is impossible to put down or shake off. What the cult favorite Oz is to television, this book is to prose–and all of the events are real.From the Hardcover edition.",0767909194,9780767909198),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Gabriel Brockwell, aesthete, poet, philosopher, disaffected twenty-something decadent, is thinking terminal. His philosophical enquiries, the abstractions he indulges, and how these relate to a life lived, all point in the same direction. His destination is Wonderland. The nature and style of the journey is all that's to be decided. Taking in London, Tokyo, Berlin and the Galapagos Islands, Lights Out In Wonderland documents Gabriel Brockwell's remarkable global odyssey. Committed to the pursuit of pleasure and in search of the Bacchanal to obliterate all previous parties, Gabriel's adventure takes in a spell in rehab, a near-death experience with fugu ovaries, a sexual encounter with an octopus, and finally an orgiastic feast in the bowels of Berlin's majestic Tempelhof Airport. Along the way we see a character disintegrate and re-shape before our eyes. Lights Out In Wonderland carries you through its many corridors of delight and horror on the back of Gabriel's voice, which is at once skeptical, idealistic, broken and optimistic. An allegorical banquet and a sly commentary on these End Times and the march towards insensate banality, DBC Pierre's third novel completes a loose trilogy of fictions, each of which stands alone as a joyful expression of the human spirit.",0571228909,9780571228904),Hardcover,,314 pages,"

",This short story is a politically charged speculative thriller composed in 2008. It was visionary when originally written. It is alarmingly uncanny today. The story links the current usurpation of American executive power to an ancient order of secrecy that employed dark oaths to murder and get gain. Prophetic warnings both ancient and modern come into play in this provocative narration.,English,English,ebook,,8 pages,"

","Poetry. Bilingual Edition. Translated from the French by William Stone. A precursor of the symbolists and the surreallists, Gerard de Nerval has fascinated many major literary figures, including Proust and Breton, Eliot and Apollinaire, Michaux and Leiris. The great sonnet cycle, in its marvellous combination of spell, quest and dream, continues to fascinate writers, readers and that special category of writerly readers, translators. Menard's translator is the gifted young poet William Stone, who explains his work in a strongly worded essay: ""like a partly submerged crocodile, with one amber eye half open, the foreign line sits, waiting for the anxious translator to make a move.""",1874320225,9781874320227),Paperback,,64 pages,"

From a love-addled bartender to a suicidal doorman to the junkies in Tompkins Square Park, they are a family, of sorts. In many cases, this is the only family some of them have, complete with all the joys and dysfunctions.

","Em LUSTRUM, segundo volume da trilogia sobre Cícero iniciada com Imperium, Harris disseca o violento e traiçoeiro mundo da política romana, a corrupção, o lado sombrio da batalha pelo poder. O caminho de Cícero rumo à posição de cônsul e soberano de Roma, a luta para se manter no comando, as manobras, a troca de favores, as chantagens. A competição com rivais tão manipuladores e escorregadios quanto ele: o jovem César, favorito da plebe, Crasso, o homem mais rico de Roma, Pompeu, general que triunfou na Hispânia.O ano é 63 AC. A expansão do Império segue estável, mas uma ameaça interna pode atrapalhar os planos de Roma. Um grupo de ricos conspiradores quer transformar a república numa ditadura. Com fabuloso talento oratório e muita esperteza, Cícero descobre e fulmina a insurreição, se expondo a grande perigo e, possivelmente, tentativas de assassinato. Motins, traição e perfídia são seu legado político, resultando em uma batalha com Julio César. Mas Tiro se mantém leal e astuto, ajudando o mestre em suas maquinações.Autor do thriller O fantasma — transformado em filme por Roman Polanski —, Harris conhece como poucos o universo político: participou do projeto do Novo Trabalhismo, mas rompeu com o líder após o alinhamento da Inglaterra à guerra contra o Iraque levada a cabo por George W. Bush. É com essa visão afiada do funcionamento dos mecanismos do poder que Harris consegue recriar o universo de conspirações e intrigas de Roma enquanto República, décadas antes do nascimento Jesus.",8501090425,9788501090423),Paperback,,419 pages,"

As Erich von Schellendorf he is able to buy a commission in an elite German cavalry regiment.

","In an exquisitely written memoir, Mia Farrow introduces us to the landscapes of her extraordinary life. Moving from her earliest memories of the walled gardens and rocky shores of Western Ireland and her Hollywood childhood to her career as an actress, she writes of these experiences and her struggle to protect her children in a painful custody battle with Woody Allen. It was the crisis that led her to reflect upon the incidents that had brought her to a place so incomprehensible. She was born the third of seven children to the beautiful actress Maureen O'Sullivan and successful writer/director John Farrow, but the isolation of a polio ward brought her childhood to an abrupt end at the age of nine. Several years later, two deaths shattered the security of the family forever, and Mia Farrow embarked upon a journey that would lead her away from the convent education that was to sustain her spiritual courage, to starring roles in Peyton Place and Rosemary's Baby, a marriage to Frank Sinatra, divorce, a defining trip to India, work on the London stage and in film, and marriage to Andre Previn. Their life together in England brought them three sons and three daughters before that marriage, too, dissolved and she returned to the United States. The year 1979 saw the beginning of a new career with brilliant performances in thirteen of Woody Allen's most distinguished films.",0553564668,9780553564662),Mass Market Paperback,,352 pages,"

","When W.O. Mitchell died in 1998 he was described as “Canada's best-loved writer.” Every commentator agreed that his best – and his best-loved – book was Who Has Seen the Wind. Since it was first published in 1947, this book has sold almost a million copies in Canada. As we enter the world of four-year-old Brian O’Connal, his father the druggist, his Uncle Sean, his mother, and his formidable Scotch grandmother (“she belshes…a lot”), it soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary book. As we watch Brian grow up, the prairie and its surprising inhabitants like the Ben and Saint Sammy – and the rich variety of small-town characters – become unforgettable. This book will be a delightful surprise for all those who are aware of it, but have never quite got around to reading it, till now.",077103475X,9780771034756),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Abbie Fox hasn’t seen her father or two younger sisters in almost two years. But now Lily, the baby of the family, is sending Abbie urgent emails begging her to return home. Their middle sister, Emma, has taken to her bed, devastated after losing her high-powered job and breaking up with her fiancé. Also, Lily is worried that the beautiful, enigmatic woman renting their guesthouse has set her sights on their widowed father. The Fox sisters closed ranks years ago after the haunting, untimely death of their mother, but seeing their dad move on with his life forces each of them to take stock.Over the course of the summer, the sisters’ lives grow as turbulent as the unpredictable currents off the New England coast: Abbie breaks her own rules in the name of love, type-A Emma learns a new definition of success, and strong-minded Lily must reconcile her dreams with reality. At summer’s end, these unforgettable women will face profound choices—and undergo personal transformations that will surprise even themselves.",English,English,Hardcover,,351 pages,"

She's been admitted to Wellesley, but her dad just lost his job, and somehow she has to come up with a year of tuition herself. But Shannon's dream of making big bucks waitressing at the local casino, the Collosio, disappears faster than a gambler's lucky streak.

Worse, time is running out, and Shannon hasn't made even half the money she'd hoped. When Shannon receives a mysterious invitation to join Aces Up, a secret network of highly talented college poker players, at first she thinks No way. She has enough to worry about: keeping her job, winning the coveted math scholarship at school, and tutoring her secret crush, Max. But when Shannon musters up the nerve to kiss Max and he doesn't react at all, the allure of Aces Up and its sexy eighteen-year-old leader, Cole, is suddenly too powerful to ignore.Soon Shannon's caught up in a web of lies and deceit that makes worrying about tuition money or a high school crush seem like kid stuff.

 And this time the shockingly sensual, ruthlessly clever Lucky is out to conquer Hollywood!  In Chances Lucky grew up in a top crime family. In Lucky, she was married three times. And now, in Lady Boss, she takes on Hollywood and wins! Panther Studios is the prize and Lucky wants it... In her quest for power she meets adversaries and enemies, friends and betrayers. And her relationship with her husband, charismatic comedian and movie star, Lennie Golden is put to the test.  Lucky's first challenge is to buy the only movie studio still not controlled by a powerful conglomerate -- Panther Studios, owned by the retired, irascible, old Abe Panther. But Abe won't sell his beloved studio to Lucky until she proves she has the guts to make it in Hollywood. It's his idea that she disguise herself as a secretary and go in undercover to find out what's really going on. It's a challenge that also satisfies Lucky's passion for adventure -- and her desire to take chances... In the process, Lucky uncovers a world of financial scheming, big-time betrayal, and bizarre sex.  Panther Studios and Lucky Santangelo... a dangerous mix... When Lucky makes her final move, assuming the role of Lady Boss  at Panther Studios, she stuns the entire industry and sets off a series of shock waves, not only threatening her marriage to Lennie, but bringing down on her head the hatred of crime boss Carlos Bonnatti -- a hatred that goes back generations, putting in peril her life, and the lives of everyone close to her!  With Lady Boss, Jackie Collins brings back one of her most intriguing and endearing characters, Lucky Santangelo.

","Sassoon's fame as a novelist and autobiographer, and the success of his posthumously published Diaries, have somewhat obscured his achievement as a poet. Apart from the famous War Poems of 1919, which firmly established his reputation, he published eight volumes of verse during his lifetime.

","Watch a video Read discussion questions for ""The Last Stand.""The bestselling author of ""Mayflower"" sheds new light on one of the iconic stories of the American WestLittle Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the Spartans' defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo.In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George Armstrong Custer, one of the Union's greatest cavalry officers and a man with a reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the government's Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations.Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. ""The Last Stand"" is a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that continues to haunt our collective imagination.",0670021725,9780670021727),Hardcover,,466 pages,"

","Bringing a fresh duo of cops to the thriller set, The Rabbit Factory is both suspenseful and satiric; a taut mystery wrapped in sharp, comedic prose.The hilarious and suspenseful introduction of Detectives Mike Lomax and Terry Biggs. Welcome to Familyland, an offshoot of Lamaar Studios. Once a small, Southern California animation house, it has grown into an entertainment conglomerate encompassing movies, television, music, video games, and a sprawling theme park. When an actor portraying Familyland's beloved mascot, Rambunctious Rabbit, is brutally murdered on park grounds, Lamaar executives are worried that the idyllic image of '50s America represented in Familyland will be shattered. They ask Mike Lomax and his partner Terry Biggs, the LAPD detectives assigned to solve the case, to keep the circumstances surrounding the death of their mascot quiet. When a second Lamaar employee is killed, Lomax and Biggs uncover a conspiracy to destroy Familyland and settle an unknown vendetta. Still under pressure to keep the case away from the public eye, the detectives are met with a third murder – and an outrageous demand: Anyone who associates with Lamaar – employees, customers, anyone – will be killed.

","Smith Island is a marshy archipelago in mid-Chesapeake Bay, nine miles from the mainland, home to 150 watermen and their families. This book is a portrait of a people who have remained intimately connected to the place in which they live, far past the time when ""place"" and ""nature"" any longer have immediate consequence to most of our lives. Tom Horton lived for nearly three years on Smith Island, recording through observation and interviews the traditions of oystering, crab catching, churchgoing, hunting and poaching, and the social rituals of these fiercely independent men and women. His beautifully elegiac story is about community and isolation, harvest and exploitation, and the risks and charms of being different from the surrounding world. Like Ian Frazier's The Great Plains, this is a book that grows from a vast and unique geography. The grassy shallows and the hidden bottoms of Smith Island, and of the Chesapeake, once supported a variety of waterfowl and marine life that astonished the early explorers. The decline of these natural wonders and the attempt to restore the health of Chesapeake Bay is one part of the story; the other is an effort to give voice to a distinctive people whose three centuries of working and being constitute an eloquent statement of humans in nature.",0679781056,9780679781059),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Desperate times call for desperate measures...When Tyler Garahan said he'd do anything to save his family's ranch, he never thought that would include taking a job as a stripper at a local ladies' club. But the club's fiery redheaded bookkeeper captures Tyler's attention, and for her, he'll swallow his pride...And one good turn deserves another...Emily Langley feels for the gorgeous cowboy. It's obvious that he's the real deal and wouldn't be caught dead in a ladies' revue if he wasn't in big trouble. And when he looks at her like that, she'll do anything to help...Working days on the ranch and nights at the ladies' club, Tyler is plumb exhausted. But could it be that his beautiful boss needs him just as much as he needs her...",English,English,Paperback,,338 pages,"

","It is the early 1980s, and America is in love with space. Growing up in the shadow of Cape Canaveral, young Dolores Gray has it particularly bad: she dreams of becoming an astronaut.At school, Dolores finds herself caught between her desire for popularity and her secret friendship with the smartest and most unpopular boy in her class, whose father is NASA's Director of Launch Safety. At home, discord begins to grow between her parents when her father's job as a NASA technician is threatened.Looking for escape, Dolores loses herself in her scrapbook, where she files away newspaper articles about the astronauts and the shuttles, weather reports on launch scrubs, and stories about her idol, Judith Resnik.Then, on the morning of January 28, 1986, seventy-three seconds after liftoff, the space shuttle ""Challenger"" explodes, killing all seven astronauts on board -- including Judith Resnik. It is a moment that shakes America to its core, and nowhere is it more deeply felt than in central Florida. Dolores becomes determined to reconstruct what went wrong, both in her parent's marriage and at NASA, in the hope that she can save her father's job and keep her family together.""The Time It Takes to Fall"" is a coming-of-age novel that deftly weaves the story of one family's drama into the larger picture of a touchstone event in American history. It is at once an intimate look at a young girl's loss of innocence and a portrait of America's loss of innocence -- the end of an era that romanticized manned space flight and would never be the same again.",0743297229,9780743297226),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

But what if you have none of these things? What if all you like to do is read books and search for odd objects that other people drop? Oh, and you have a perfect older sister who really should have had your name instead of you.And when you’re a prince, you’re supposed to be athletic and commanding and brave and tall. But what if you are none of those things? What if all you like to do is play the bagpipes (badly), study the stars, and try to figure out how to make worms live forever? Oh, and you also have a perfect older brother who is a lot more princely than you’ll ever be.But when Beauty’s life turns completely upside down and she is forced to head out into the world, she has to figure out just who she wants to be. And when Prince Riley suddenly grows fur, and nails as sharp as sticks, he has to learn that appearances can be deceiving. Before Beauty and Riley can save each other, they have to save themselves.So journey back to the time when fairy tales were real, and discover the story of Beauty and the Beast like you’ve never heard it before.",English,English,Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Why do many men love porn so much? And can he love porn and still love his wife? Respected psychologist Michael Bader takes an honest look at the nuances of male sexuality, addressing issues such as sexual boredom, internet sex, and sexual fantasies that can leave women bewildered and men ashamed. Illustrated with engaging examples from his practice, Male Sexuality gives readers, both women and men, deeper understanding of male behavior from the flamboyant to the mundane. Through increased awareness of the psychology behind the sex, Bader aims to enhance individual self-esteem and improve communication in relationships.",0742560694,9780742560697),Hardcover,,156 pages,"

","Following on from the success of the historical novel Under the Scaffold, Faith Cook has taken the content of her acclaimed biography of Lady Jane Grey and crafted a novel around a fictional member of the royal court, but based upon the facts surrounding the life of Lady Jane Grey, focusing particularly upon her Christian faith. This historic novel enables the reader to gain an appreciation of the courage of this young lady and will be an inspiration. Using a narrative form in which some of the characters are fictitious, Faith Cook brings to life for the modern reader a period of English history which was marked by great suffering fo Christians who sought to remain faithful to the truths of the Bible. The account is based first of all on the life of young Lady Jane Grey, nine-day Queen of England, who found herself caught up in a web of intrigue and political ambition, and then on the frightening cruelties which followed during the reign of Mary Tudor. Set against a background of actual historical events, the narrative introduces the reader to many authentic historical figures, often using their own recorded words; both a challenge and encouragement to believers today is provided.",0852346239,9780852346235),Paperback,,286 pages,"

","Zhang Xianliang, one of China's greatest living writers, spent twenty-two years in Chinese prisons and labor camps until his ""rehabilitation"" in 1979. Through most of those years he kept a diary of his experiences. Because any detail would have meant the diary's destruction and Zhang's execution, the entries were curt and cryptic; sometimes entire days were condensed into two or three words. This is a frightening portrait of how a major civilization can bring itself to its knees by mass complicity (it would have been absurdly easy to escape from the camp, yet no prisoner ever thought to do so), told with a deft matter-of-factness that only highlights the horror. At the same time, Zhang does not ignore the minor kindnesses and moments of human recognition that dotted his prison years.",1567920306,9781567920307),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","Peter and Rebecca Harris: mid-forties denizens of Manhattan’s SoHo, nearing the apogee of committed careers in the arts—he a dealer, she an editor. With a spacious loft, a college-age daughter in Boston, and lively friends, they are admirable, enviable contemporary urbanites with every reason, it seems, to be happy. Then Rebecca’s much younger look-alike brother, Ethan (known in thefamily as Mizzy, “the mistake”), shows up for a visit. A beautiful, beguiling twenty-three-year-old with a history of drug problems, Mizzy is wayward, at loose ends, looking for direction. And in his presence, Peter finds himself questioning his artists, their work, his career—the entire world he has so carefully constructed.Like his legendary, Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, The Hours, Michael Cunningham’s masterly new novel is a heartbreaking look at the way we live now. Full of shocks and aftershocks, it makes us think and feel deeply about the uses and meaning of beauty and the place of love in our lives.<",0374299080,9780374299088),Hardcover,,238 pages,"

Hän pyrkii määrättyyn maailmankatsomukseen ja hänen uuden romaaninsa rehellisyys ja sen korkea henkinen taso tekee lukijaan syvän vaikutuksen. Työläisperheen elämää, tehdasta ja tehdaskaupunkia ei ole koskaan Suomessa niin hyvin kuvattu kuin Pekkasen romaanissa. Sen sankari, nuori työläinen, kokee köyhän, mutta elämänjanoisen nuoruuden, joutuu aikaisin työhön tehtaaseen ja siellä erilaisten ihmistyyppien ja aatteitten kanssa kosketuksiin, kokee kaksi rakkautta ja saavuttaa vähitellen henkisen tasapainon.

While a college student at The New School, Melissa Febos spent four years working as a dominatrix in a midtown dungeon. In poetic, nuanced prose she charts how unchecked risk-taking eventually gave way to a course of self-destruction. But as she recounts crossing over the very boundaries that she set for her own safety, she never plays the victim. In fact, the glory of this memoir is Melissa’s ability to illuminate the strange and powerful truths that she learned as she found her way out of a hell of her own making.

In Deck the Halls, they rescued Regan's kidnapped father. This time they get in the middle of a case involving a beautiful eighty-foot blue spruce that has been chosen to spend the holidays as Rockefeller Center's famous Christmas tree. The folks who picked the tree don't have a clue that attached to one of its branches is a flask chock-full of priceless diamonds that Packy Noonan, a scam artist just released from prison, had hidden there over twelve years ago. An excited Packy breaks his parole and heads to Stowe, Vermont, to reclaim his loot. Once there, he is horrified to discover that his special tree will be heading to New York City the next morning. With a bumbling crew consisting of Jo-Jo, Benny, and an unsuccessful poet, Milo, he knows he has to act fast. What Packy does not know is that Alvirah and Regan are on a weekend trip to stowe with Alvirah's husband, Willy; Regan's fiance, Jack; Regan's parents, Luke and Nora; and Alvirah's friend Opal, a lottery winner who lost all her winnings in Packy's scam.

Ronald insisted that she was mistaken-- but Jennifer's positive identification was the compelling evidence that put him behind bars.

Two years later, Jennifer and Ronald met face to face-- and forged an unlikely friendship that changed both of their lives.In their own words, Jennifer and Ronald unfold the harrowing details of their tragedy, and challenge our ideas of memory and judgment while demonstrating the profound nature of human grace and the healing power of forgiveness.",0312376537,9780312376536),Hardcover,,298 pages,"

","“As a little boy, I had a dream that my father had taken me to the woods where there was a dead body. He buried it and told me I must never tell. It was the only thing we’d ever done together as father and son, and I promised not to tell. But unlike most dreams, the memory of this one never left me. And sometimes…I wasn’t altogether sure about one thing: was it just a dream?”When Augusten Burroughs was small, his father was a shadowy presence in his life: a form on the stairs, a cough from the basement, a silent figure smoking a cigarette in the dark. As Augusten grew older, something sinister within his father began to unfurl.  Something dark and secretive that could not be named. Betrayal after shocking betrayal ensued, and Augusten’s childhood was over. The kind of father he wanted didn’t exist for him. This father was distant, aloof, uninterested…And then the “games” began.With ""A Wolf at the Table"", Augusten Burroughs makes a quantum leap into untapped emotional terrain: the radical pendulum swing between love and hate, the unspeakably terrifying relationship between father and son. Told with scorching honesty and penetrating insight, it is a story for anyone who has ever longed for unconditional love from a parent. Though harrowing and brutal, ""A Wolf at the Table"" will ultimately leave you buoyed with the profound joy of simply being alive. It’s a memoir of stunning psychological cruelty and the redemptive power of hope. ",0312342020,9780312342029),Hardcover,,242 pages,"

","Ringo, una ragazza che lavora nelle cucine di un ristorante turco di Tokyo, rientra una sera a casa con l'intenzione di preparare una cena succulenta per il suo fidanzato col quale convive da un po'. Con suo sommo sgomento, però, scopre che l'appartamento è completamente vuoto. Niente televisore, lavatrice, frigorifero, mobili, tende, niente di niente. Spariti persino gli utensili in cucina, il mortaio di epoca Meiji ereditato dalla nonna materna, la casseruola Le Creuset acquistata con la paga del suo primo impiego, il coltello italiano ricevuto in occasione del suo ventesimo compleanno. E, soprattutto, sparito il fidanzato indiano, maître nel ristorante accanto al suo, un ragazzo con la pelle profumata di spezie.Lo choc di Ringo è tale che resta impietrita al centro della casa desolatamente vuota, la voce che non le esce più dalla bocca. Decide allora di ritornare al villaggio natio, dove non mette più piede da quando, quindicenne, è scappata di casa in un giorno di primavera.Là, appartata nella quiete dei monti, matura il suo dolore. Una mattina, però, osservando il granaio della casa materna, Ringo ha un'idea singolare per tornare pienamente alla vita: aprire un ristorante per non più di una coppia al giorno, con un menu ad hoc, ritagliato sulla fisionomia e i possibili desideri dei clienti.Con l'aiuto del valente Kuma-san, l'ex factotum della scuola elementare del villaggio, il cui cuore è stato infranto dalla bella Shiñorita, un'argentina scappata in città, Ringo risistema il granaio. Pareti tinteggiate d'arancio, posate di epoca vittoriana e di epoca Taish e, nel giro di qualche mese, il Lumachino, così la ragazza battezza il ristorante, apre i battenti.La prima cliente è la Concubina, la triste amante di un influente politico locale, passato a miglior vita diversi anni prima. Sulla tavola, in un tripudio di colori, odori e bontà senza pari, si alternano piatti gustosissimi che attingono alle cucine più famose: giapponese, italiana, cinese e francese su tutte. L'indomani, la Concubina, agghindata di solito a lutto con una lunga veste nera, passeggia con un cappotto rosso fuoco e un magnifico colbacco di pelliccia, e il suo atteggiamento schivo ha lasciato spazio a una marcata allegria. La medesima cosa accade a tutti i clienti del Lumachino: una ragazza riesce a fare innamorare di sé l'ex compagno di classe che l'aveva sempre ignorata, una coppia gay in fuga d'amore tra i monti trasforma il soggiorno in una luna di miele, un uomo burbero e scorbutico diventa un gentiluomo e così via. In breve, la notizia della magia del Lumachino si diffonde in tutto il circondario, e il successo è così garantito, poiché tutti vogliono sedersi alla tavola del ristorante dell'amore ritrovato.",885450419X,9788854504196),Paperback,Le tavole d'oro,191 pages,"

","The year was 1957, the month September, and I had just turned eight years old. Dwight Eisenhower was President, but in my life it was the diminutive, intense Sister Mary Lurana who ruled, at least in the third-grade class where I was held captive. For reasons you will soon understand, my parents had remanded me to the penal institution of St. Brigid's School in Westbury, New York, a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one. Already, I had barely survived my first two years at St. Brigid's because I was, well, a little nitwit. Not satisfied with memorizing the Baltimore Catechism's fine prose, which featured passages like ""God made me to show his goodness and to make me happy with him in heaven,"" I was constantly annoying my classmates and, of course, the no-nonsense Sister Lurana. With sixty overactive students in her class, she was understandably short on patience. For survival, she had also become quick on the draw. Then it happened. One day I blurted out some dumb remark, and Sister Lurana was on me like a panther. Her black habit blocked out all distractions as she leaned down, looked me in the eye, and uttered words I have never forgotten: ""William, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity."" And she was dead-on. One day in 1957, in the third-grade classroom of St. Brigid's parochial school, an exasperated Sister Mary Lurana bent over a restless young William O'Reilly and said, ""William, you are a bold, fresh piece of humanity."" Little did she know that she was, early in his career as a troublemaker, defining the essence of Bill O'Reilly and providing him with the title of his brash and entertaining issues-based memoir. And this time it's personal. In his most intimate book yet, O'Reilly goes back in time to examine the people, places, and experiences that launched him on his journey from working-class kid to immensely influential television personality and bestselling author. Readers will learn how his traditional outlook was formed in the crucible of his family, his neighborhood, his church, and his schools, and how his views on America's proper role in the world emerged from covering four wars on five continents over three-plus decades as a news correspondent. What will delight his numerous fans and surprise many others is the humor and self-deprecation with which he handles one of his core subjects: himself, and just how O'Reilly became O'Reilly.",0767928822,9780767928823),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

And while I'm usually roped into the behind-the-scenes work, it turns out that I haven't gone unnoticed. Something happened on my parents' research trip in Charleston—and now I'm being stalked by some truly frightening other beings. Trying to fit into a new school and keeping my parents' creepy occupation a secret from my friends—and potential boyfriends—is hard enough without having angry spirits whispering in my ear.

London is a fantastical sprawling metropolis where dirigibles roam the skies, robot bobbies enforce the law and dinosaurs are on display in London zoo. Welcome to Magna Britannia, a steam driven world full of fantastical creations and shady villains. Here dashing dandies and mustachioed villains battle for supremacy while below the city strange things stir in the flooded tunnels of the old London Underground. In two scant months the nation, and all her colonies, will celebrate 160 years of Queen Victoria's glorious reign. But all is not well at the heart of the empire of Magna Britannia. A chain of events is about to be set in motion that, if not stopped, could lead to a world-shattering conclusion. It begins with a break-in at the Natural History Museum.

","From the author of Drowning Ruth, a haunting, atmospheric novel set at the closing of the frontier about a young wife who moves to a far-flung and forbidding lighthouse where she uncovers a life-changing secret. Trudy is a polished, college-educated young woman from a respectable upper middle-class family, and it’s only a matter of time before she’ll marry Ernst, the son of her parents’ closest friends. All should be well in her world, and yet Trudy is restless and desperate for more stimulation than 1897 Milwaukee will allow. When she falls in love with enigmatic and ambitious Oskar, she believes she’s found her escape from the banality of her pre-ordained life. Alienated from Trudy’s family and friends, the couple moves across the country to take a job at a lighthouse in the eerily isolated Point Lucia, California. Upon arriving they meet the light station’s only inhabitants—the Crawleys, a family whose plain appearance is no indication of what lies below the surface. It isn’t long before Trudy begins to realize that there is more going on in this seemingly empty place than she could ever have imagined.Gorgeously detailed, swiftly paced, and anchored in the lush geography of the remote and eternally mesmerizing Big Sur, The Edge of the Earth is a magical and moving story of secrets and self-transformation, ruses and rebirths, masterfully told by a celebrated and accomplished author.",1451683677,9781451683677),Hardcover,,275 pages,"

Lured by his nostalgia for a leafy suburban childhood spent in south-west London, he returned with his Indian-born, American fiancee in tow. But, priced out of the housing market, they found themselves living not in a townhouse, oozing Victorian charm, but in a squalid attic above a Bangladeshi sweatshop on London's Brick Lane. A grimy skylight provided the only window on their new world—a filthy, noisy street where drug dealers and prostitutes peddled their wares and tramps urinated on the pavements. Yet, as Hall got to know Brick Lane, he discovered beneath its unlovely surface an inner world where immigrants and asylum seekers struggle to better themselves and dream of escape.

","Isabel Cruz was fifteen years old when she met Tom Stevens. She was 15 when they started dating, and 16 when she lost her virginity to him. By the time she turned 18 and went to college, everything had fallen apart.This hadn’t been an ordinary love, though. Not a love between two dear friends, or even high school sweethearts. This had been the most taboo sort of love there was: a relationship between a student and her teacher. Isabel started her high school career as a normal student, but set her sights on Tom Stevens as soon as she met him, and pursued him with an intense – and sometimes reckless – fascination. When he finally approached her after swim practice and told her that he shared her feelings, it was the start of a forbidden and dangerous relationship.Join Isabel as she makes her way through this dark love story, hiding from teachers, lying to her parents, and defying the authorities to make a life with the man she loves. Watch as she discovers the wonders of love and romance, and the terrible betrayal of jealous friends. And cry with her when she learns the hard truth about life and the people in her world. Sweetest Taboo is inspired by the true and tragic stories of students who fall in love with their teachers, and live with the hard truths of forbidden romances. In a world full of after-school specials on sexual predators, this touching book seeks a different path, casting both student and teacher in a gentle light, and showing that true love may lie at the base of even the most illicit romance.",B009OKSNYC,B009OKSNYC,Paperback,,295 pages,"

","Emerging author Chavisa Woods has been noted for capturing a ""strange, troubling vision of domestic life in the rural U.S."" (Go Magazine). Here she presents a technicolored vision of rural adolescence, the story of a girl with an unpronounceable name---a fiery, unhinged, growling, big-hearted queer country girl in a dirty black tutu and combat boots who travels along all the bizarre yet familiar byways of human desire from the cornfields of Louisiana and the big brass sound of Mardi Gras to the heights of the Empire State Building. Turning the tradition of the southern gothic novel on its head, Woods presents a new land of contemporary misfits including fire-dancers, pseudo-Nazis who breed albino animals, Catholic workers, horse thieves, and the archangel Gabrielle.A bold exploration of the intersections of race, class, and sexuality, The Albino Album contemplates the relationships between political action, art and romance, as our heroine tries on a series of bewitchingly fantastical families looking for the place to call home.",Lambda,(2014),Paperback,,560 pages,"

","Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson’s groundbreaking bestseller, When Elephants Weep, was the first book since Darwin’s time to explore emotions in the animal kingdom, particularly from animals in the wild. Now, he focuses exclusively on the contained world of the farm animal, revealing startling, irrefutable evidence that barnyard creatures have feelings too, even consciousness.Weaving history, literature, anecdotes, scientific studies, and Masson’s own vivid experiences observing pigs, cows, sheep, goats, and chickens over the course of five years, this important book at last gives voice, meaning, and dignity to these gentle beasts that are bred to be milked, shorn, butchered, and eaten. Can we ever know what makes an animal happy? Many animal behaviorists say no. But Jeffrey Masson has a different view: An animal is happy if it can live according to its own nature. Farm animals suffer greatly in this regard. Chickens, for instance, like to perch in trees at night, to avoid predators and to nestle with friends. The obvious conclusion: They cannot be happy when confined twenty to a cage. From field and barn, to pen and coop, Masson bears witness to the emotions and intelligence of these remarkable farm animals, each unique with distinct qualities. Curious, intelligent, self-reliant–many will find it hard to believe that these attributes describe a pig. In fact, there is much that humans share with pigs. They dream, know their names, and can see colors. Mother cows mourn the loss of their calves when their babies are taken away to slaughter. Given a choice between food that is nutritious or lacking in minerals, sheep will select the former, balancing their diet and correcting the deficiency. Goats display quite a sense of humor, dignity, and fearlessness (Indian goats have been known to kill leopards). Chickens are naturally sociable–they will gather around a human companion and stand there serenely preening themselves or sit quietly on the ground beside someone they trust.For far too long farm animals have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings. Shattering the abhorrent myth of the “dumb animal without feelings,” Jeffrey Masson has written a revolutionary book that is sure to stir human emotions far and wide.From the Hardcover edition.",0345452828,9780345452825),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","In Tremeirchson, a barn leader’s children are expected to follow their parents into the sky, becoming riders of the magnificent winged horses that are the medieval Welsh village’s legacy. Neither Emma nor Davyd, however, want to follow that tradition.Sixteen-year-old Emma risks losing her family by following her heart. Eager to take her place in the air, she longs to ride a forbidden winged colt born in barn of her father’s biggest rival. She also dreams of the rival’s sons, not sure which she truly loves. Bold and exciting, Evan will someday lead his father’s barn. Davyd is quieter, more dependable, with an ability to get things done. Her father disapproves of both boys and pushes her toward an ambitious newcomer. He also insists she ride the colt he’s picked for her.Davyd, also sixteen, is plagued with a secret—he is afraid of heights. Refusing to become a rider means public humiliation, his parents’ disappointment, and lifelong ridicule from his brother, Evan. He reluctantly prepares to join his family aloft in the Aerial Games that provide the entire village with its livelihood and tries desperately to think of an alternative.As Tremeirchson’s barns prepare for the Rider Ceremony, winged horses suddenly start dying. Shocked, the adults hesitate, mired in tradition and politics. Is it a disease or poison? Accidental or purposeful?

","«De un Asunto tenebroso, que se publicó en forma de folletín entre enero y febrero de 1841, suele decirse que fue la primera novela policíaca del mundo. Rigurosamente coetánea es otra gran pieza fundacional del género, Los asesinatos de la calle Morgue , del americano Poe, aparecida este mismo año, pero se trata de un relato breve que no hace más que establecer las clásicas reglas de la investigación como desafío al ingenio. La obra de Balzac tiene una amplitud mucho mayor, y no sólo por el número de páginas; vemos como la ficción invade la Historia con mayúscula para servirse de ella, pero también para explicarla, y como el enigma llega a adquirir luego secretas resonancias casi inconfesables. »Balzac trabaja con situaciones que no admiten ningún grado de asepsia: sentimientos humanos por una parte; por otra, altos intereses políticos. Novela policíaca, desde luego, pero de ningún modo inocente; todo lo contrario, cargada de complejísimos supuestos de todo orden que hacen que éste sea un relato detectivesco heterodoxo, impuro, como dicen los teóricos, pero gracias a ello novela en el sentido propio de la palabra.» Del prólogo de Carlos Pujol.",Spanish,Spanish,Hardcover,,280 pages,"

","A thrilling chronicle of the tragedy-ridden history of climbing K2, the world's most difficult and unpredictable mountain, by the bestselling authors of No Shortcuts to the TopAt 28,251 feet, the world's second-tallest mountain, K2 thrusts skyward out of the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan. Climbers regard it as the ultimate achievement in mountaineering, with good reason. Four times as deadly as Everest, K2 has claimed the lives of seventy-seven climbers since 1954. In August 2008 eleven climbers died in a single thirty-six-hour period on K2–the worst single-event tragedy in the mountain's history and the second-worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges. Yet summiting K2 remains a cherished goal for climbers from all over the globe. Before he faced the challenge of K2 himself, Ed Viesturs, one of the world's premier high-altitude mountaineers, thought of it as ""the holy grail of mountaineering.""In K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain, Viesturs explores the remarkable history of the mountain and of those who have attempted to conquer it. At the same time he probes K2's most memorable sagas in an attempt to illustrate the lessons learned by confronting the fundamental questions raised by mountaineering–questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and were nearly killed in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death. Fortunately, Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott' s.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs and Roberts crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling. With photographs from Viesturs's personal collection and from historical sources, this is the definitive account of the world's ultimate mountain, and of the lessons that can be gleaned from struggling toward its elusive summit.",0767932501,9780767932509),Hardcover,,342 pages,"

","At forty-five, clinical psychologist Davida Grayson, leaves a thriving practice in Oakland, California to return to her childhood home in Still Water, Kansas after the death of her reclusive father. Her mother is in a nursing home, suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the ensuing months, unsettling events threaten Davida’s safety, sobriety, and sanity. Foremost among these is the reappearance of her high school sweetheart, Paul, who had traumatized Davida as a teenager by playing an inexplicably cruel practical joke. Events suggest that he may be stalking her, but she is starting to question her own perceptions. Despite increasing self-doubt, she continues to work, via long distance phone calls, with three of her Oakland therapy clients: a Korean college student whose burden of responsibility toward his immigrant parents has led him to attempt suicide; a stoic, workaholic man anguished by being his family’s scapegoat; and a woman coping with the family havoc wreaked by her husband’s bipolar illness. Interwoven with the main plot of the novel, their stories resonate with Davida’s struggle against mental deterioration and her quest to solve the central mystery of her life.From Kirkus Reviews: “[A] … readable novel about making sense of family history beset by secrets and pain. … At times vivid and evocative … [a] riveting mystery at the novel’s core. … the plot’s serpentine twists will propel readers through to the satisfying end.” Kirkus Reviews",English,English,Paperback,,374 pages,"

","New edition of Storm Constantine's visionary science fantasy novel. Casmeer is the only living soul left in Thermidore, high atop the mountains of Overhang. So it has been for hundreds of years. Immortal historian and chronicler, Casmeer is the self-appointed keeper of the city's remains and its crystalline inhabitants. Finnigin is a young terranaut, whose people collect the crystal fragments from Thermidore that wash down from the mountains to use as pilot stones to guide the floating cities across the Flatlands. Finnigin is forced to leave his people on an initiation of manhood, to journey across the plains and confront the mystery of the pilot stones. Ays is a Priest of Hands, a consoler to the dying, in the floating city of Min. His faith shaken by the words of a dying man, he undertakes a journey of his own, and leaves his flying city to face the unknown on the Flatlands. But as both Ays and Finnigin travel throughout their world, they are haunted by a mysterious figure who seems to know more about them than they do themselves. When Ays and Finnigin cross paths, they find their lives linked in ways they could not have imagined. While in Thermidore, Casmeer, the last immortal, has one last chronicle to write. Storm Constantine is a literary fantast of outstanding power and originality. . .Calenture [is] exotic, erotic and packed with surprises. - Michael Moorcock This is fantasy that lives and breathes. . . and leaves the reader a little wiser when the last page is turned. -Locus",0966784812,9780966784817),Paperback,,406 pages,"

","Discover The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet for iPad. A brilliant, boundary-leaping debut novel tracing twelve-year-old genius map maker T.S. Spivet's attempts to understand the ways of the worldWhen twelve-year-old genius cartographer T.S. Spivet receives an unexpected phone call from the Smithsonian announcing he has won the prestigious Baird Award, life as normal-if you consider mapping family dinner table conversation normal-is interrupted and a wild cross-country adventure begins, taking T.S. from his family ranch just north of Divide, Montana, to the museum's hallowed halls. T.S. sets out alone, leaving before dawn with a plan to hop a freight train and hobo east. Once aboard, his adventures step into high gear and he meticulously maps, charts, and illustrates his exploits, documenting mythical wormholes in the Midwest, the urban phenomenon of ""rims,"" and the pleasures of McDonald's, among other things. We come to see the world through T.S.'s eyes and in his thorough investigation of the outside world he also reveals himself. As he travels away from the ranch and his family we learn how the journey also brings him closer to home. A secret family history found within his luggage tells the story of T.S.'s ancestors and their long-ago passage west, offering profound insight into the family he left behind and his role within it. As T.S. reads he discovers the sometimes shadowy boundary between fact and fiction and realizes that, for all his analytical rigor, the world around him is a mystery. All that he has learned is tested when he arrives at the capital to claim his prize and is welcomed into science's inner circle. For all its shine, fame seems more highly valued than ideas in this new world and friends are hard to find. T.S.'s trip begins at the Copper Top Ranch and the last known place he stands is Washington, D.C., but his journey's movement is far harder to track: How do you map the delicate lessons learned about family and self? How do you depict how it feels to first venture out on your own? Is there a definitive way to communicate the ebbs and tides of heartbreak, loss, loneliness, love? These are the questions that strike at the core of this very special debut.Now a major motion picture directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and starring Kyle Catlett and Helena Bonham Carter. ",1594202176,9781594202179),Hardcover,,375 pages,"

But like many immigrants, he’s living only half a life. He dreams of the day his beloved wife, Farak, will be able to join him in New York and complete his vision of the American dream. But when she tells him that she is leaving him for another man, Ushman is shattered. He begins to wander aimlessly through the terminals of JFK Airport, imagining a now-impossible reunion with Farak. Unexpectedly, he meets Stella, a Barnard College student who has just bade farewell to her parents en route for an Italian vacation. After Stella, isolated in her own way, finds herself at Ushman’s Manhattan store, they embark on an improbable and powerful romance. Together this American girl from the Deep South and the Iranian aesthete form a tender bond that awakens them both to the possibility of joy in a world full of tragedy.",0670034819,9780670034819),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","From rock bottom to recovery—the son of veteran broadcaster Bill Moyers chronicles his life- shattering battle with addiction and the hard-won fight for recovery  William Cope Moyers has come a long, long way. In 1994, he lay on the floor of an Atlanta crack house. His father had put together a search party. His worried family waited at home where Moyers had left them when he embarked on yet another binge. From that lowly, drug-hazed night, Moyers went on to become an executive at the Hazelden Foundation and travels far and wide to talk about addiction and treatment.  Broken tells the story of what happened between then and now—from growing up the privileged son of Bill Moyers to his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, his numerous stabs at getting clean, his many relapses, and how he managed to survive. Harrowing and wrenching, Broken paints a picture of a man with every advantage who nonetheless found himself spiraling into a dark and life-threatening abyss. But unlike other memoirs of its kind, Broken emerges into the clear light of Moyers’s recovery as he dedicates his life to changing the politics of addiction. Beautifully written with a deep underlying spirituality, this is a missive of hope for the scores of Americans struggling with addiction—and an honest and inspiring account that proves the spiritual insight that we are strongest at the broken places.",0670037893,9780670037896),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","The Taisho period, loosely the first three decades of the twentieth century, was a dynamic era in Japan. On one hand, it spawned social liberalism and political radicalism; on the other, it generated the social conservatism and cultural nativism that grew into the ultra-nationalism of 1937-1945.In art, it produced an infatuation with Western modernism as well as a new exploration of traditional aesthetics. Between these dramatic polarities was a rich middle ground of cultural synthesis and symbiosis in which Western concepts of modernity and nostalgia for Japanese tradition seamlessly merged or creatively contrasted. These values are witnessed in the Art Deco style, particularly as it infused Japanese art of Taisho.Much of the debate over Japanese cultural identity centered on the appearance and social role of women. The primary focus in this volume is the nexus of tradition and modernity manifest in popular images of women, as well as in domestic furnishings and fashions made for women.In an introductory essay, historian Sharon Minichiello provides a broad context for these issues by sketching major domestic and international events and themes of the period. In his essay and catalogue entries, art historian Kendall Brown first examines how women were at the center of the sociocultural debate on Japanese modernity, then details how artists helped fashion various female types, including the modern girl, the traditional beauty, and a new type of hybrid woman.The nihonga paintings, woodblock prints, textiles, and domestic artifacts discussed and illustrated here are a broad range of objects representative of mainstream Taisho visual culture, and reconstruct the styles popular from 1915 to 1935 in a celebration of Taisho- Chic.",0937426520,9780937426524),Paperback,,176 pages,"

In the midst of these treacherous times, Juan Tenorio is born and then abandoned in the barn of a convent. Raised secretly by the nuns, he learns to love and worship all women and wants nothing more than to be a priest, until he falls in love with one of the sisters. When their affair is discovered, Juan leaves the Church forever. He is soon recruited to be a spy by the powerful Marquis de la Mota, who teaches him to become the world's greatest libertine and seducer of women. But when he crosses swords with the most powerful man in the Empire, Don Juan must escape the murderous fury of the Inquisitor who battles all forms of debauchery, deviance, and heresy.It is after knowing countless women that he is convinced by the Marquis to keep a diary, and it is here within its pages that Don Juan reveals his greatest adventures and the Arts of Passion he mastered.

","Lucas Davenport finds some changes — and some nasty surprises — in store, in the chilling new novel by the number-one-bestselling author.After thirteen years and thirteen Prey novels, John Sandford's writing is as fresh as ever. His last book, Mortal Prey, was ""a model of the genre"" (People) and ""the cop novel of the year"" (Kirkus Reviews). In the words of the Washington Post: ""John Sandford does everything right.""Now, in Naked Prey, he puts Lucas Davenport through some changes. His old boss, Rose Marie Roux, has moved up to the state level and taken Lucas with her, creating a special troubleshooter job for him for the cases that are too complicated or politically touchy for others to handle. In addition, Lucas is married now, and a new father, all of which is fine with him: he doesn't mind being a family man. But he is a little worried. For every bit of peace you get, you have to pay — and he's waiting for the bill.It comes in the form of two people found hanging from a tree in the woods of northern Minnesota. What makes the situation particularly sensitive is that the bodies are of a black man and a white woman, and they're naked. ""Lynching"" is the word that everybody's trying not to say — but, as Lucas begins to discover, in fact the murders are nothing like what they appear to be, and they are not the end of it. There is worse to come — much, much worse.Filled with rich characterization and exceptional drama that are his hallmarks, this is Sandford's most suspenseful novel yet. ""You know life is good when you have a new Lucas Davenport thriller to escape into,"" writes the Chicago Tribune, and Naked Prey proves it again.",0743468694,9780743468695),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Abraham Abulafia, the founder of the ecstatic Kabbalah, exposed a mysticism that includes a deep interest in language as a universe in itself, to be studied as the philosophers study nature, in order to attain higher knowledge than natural science and speculative philosophy. The status of Hebrew as the natural, intellectual, and primordial language is discussed against the background of the medieval speculations regarding this topic.Abulafia proposed an elaborate hermeneutical system, unique in the whole Kabbalistic literature, for both its systematic exposition and the eccentric exegetical devices it describes. Various versions of this sevenfold system occur in several manuscripts that are collected and analyzed here in detail for the first time.Torah was regarded by Abulafia as the most important text, reflecting the constitution of the intellectual world and being identical with the Active intellect and even to God Himself. On the other hand, Torah was interpreted in Abulafia's Kabbalah as an allegory to the psychological processes of the mystic, an approach different from the regular Kabbalistic interpretation of this text as a symbolic corpus reflecting the divine intrasefirotic life.",0887068316,9780887068317),Hardcover,,212 pages,"

","Penguin delivers you to the front lines of The Pacific Theater with the real-life stories behind the HBO miniseries.Between America's retreat from China in late November 1941 and the moment General MacArthur's airplane touched down on the Japanese mainland in August of 1945, five men connected by happenstance fought the key battles of the war against Japan. From the debacle in Bataan, to the miracle at Midway and the relentless vortex of Guadalcanal, their solemn oaths to their country later led one to the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot and the others to the coral strongholds of Peleliu, the black terraces of Iwo Jima and the killing fields of Okinawa, until at last the survivors enjoyed a triumphant, yet uneasy, return home.  In The Pacific, Hugh Ambrose focuses on the real-life stories of the five men who put their lives on the line for our country. To deepen the story revealed in the miniseries and go beyond it, the book dares to chart a great ocean of enmity known as The Pacific and the brave men who fought. Some considered war a profession, others enlisted as citizen soldiers. Each man served in a different part of the war, but their respective duties required every ounce of their courage and their strength to defeat an enemy who preferred suicide to surrender. The medals for valor which were pinned on three of them came at a shocking price-a price paid in full by all.",English,English,Hardcover,,489 pages,"

","Lucifer's War, which damned legions of angels to Hell, is an ancient and bitter memory shrouded in the smoke and ash of the Inferno. The Fallen, those banished demons who escaped the full wrath of Heaven, have established a limitless and oppressive kingdom within the fiery confines of Hell. Lucifer has not been seen since the Fall and the mantle of rulership has been passed to the horrific Prince Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies. The Demons Major, Heaven's former warriors, have become the ruling class. They are the equivalent to landed lords, each owing allegiance to the de facto ruler of Hell. They reign over their fiefdoms, tormenting the damned souls and adding to their wealth.One Demon Major, however, who has not forgotten his former life in Heaven. The powerful Lord Sargatanas is restless. For millennia Sargatanas has ruled dutifully but unenthusiastically, building his city, Adamantinarx, into the model of an Infernal metropolis. But he has never forgotten what he lost in the Fall--proximity to God. He is sickened by what he has become. Now, with a small event--a confrontation with one of the damned souls--he makes a decision that will reverberate through every being in Hell. Sargatanas decides to attempt the impossible, to rebel, to endeavor to go Home and bring with him anyone who chooses to follow . . . be they demon or soul. He will stake everything on this chance for redemption.",0765309858,9780765309853),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","Le Prophète occupe une place unique dans la conscience et la vie des musulmans. Il est l'Envoyé de Dieu, celui qui a reçu et transmis le Coran. Il n'est pourtant pas un médiateur : Muhammad ne fut qu'un homme, qui a transformé le monde à la lumière des révélations et des inspirations qui lui sont parvenues de l'Unique.Cette humanité assumée, élue et inspirée fait de lui un modèle pour les fidèles d'aujourd'hui. Son parcours renvoie aux questions premières et éternelles : sa vie est une invite à l'humilité, à la fraternité, au respect, à la justice et à la paix. Mais aussi, et surtout, à l'amour. C'est pourquoi le souffle de la Révélation porte un enseignement utile à tous les hommes, qu'ils soient ou non musulmans.Humanité, exemplarité : telles sont les deux dimensions à travers lesquelles Tariq Ramadan restitue la figure fondatrice de l'islam. S'appuyant sur les sources les plus fiables, il restitue le parcours et les actions de Muhammad, accompa­gnant son récit de réflexions sur le sens profond de cette vie. Parce qu'il souligne l'actualité de la parole du Prophète, ce livre est également une introduction privilégiée à l'islam.Tariq Ramadan, professeur d'islamologie, enseigne aux universités d'Oxford et de Rotterdam. Attaché à l'université de Doshisha (Kyoto), il est également président du groupe de réflexion et d'action European Muslim Network à Bruxelles. Engagé depuis vingt ans dans le renouveau de la pensée musulmane et dans la réflexion sur la place de l'islam en Occident et dans le monde, il est l'auteur de Islam, la réforme radicale (Presses du Châtelet, 2008).",2352870976,9782352870975),Mass Market Paperback,,382 pages,"

It shows how poetry illuminates the eternal feelings and desires that stir the human heart and soul. These poems explore such universal themes as the awakening of wonder, the longing for love, the wisdom of dreams, and the courage required for living an authentic life.

Outside, the civil war of 1216 rages through the English countryside, throwing into jeopardy all that its people hold dear. As the turmoil outside reaches a peak, Miriel itches to break free from her life inside as a religious novice. She plots to escape but her plans screech to a halt when a soldier of fortune, a half-dead Nicholas de Caen appears at the convent door. Once held captive by royalist troops, he has managed to escape their clutches with part of the royal regalia, but his flight has sapped all life from him.Miriel nurses him with the vigor she has had suppressed in her imprisonment, and revives Nicholas, in whom she recognizes her own stubborn pride and independence. He is not only her kindred spirit, he is also her only way out. So upon his recovery and release, Miriel coerces her former patient into taking her with him.Never one for nostalgia, Miriel has only seen Nicholas as a means of escape, and once out of the convent, the two part on bad terms. From this point forward, misfortune will plague Miriel's life until she runs into a new Nicholas, this time a famous soldier and merchant. Can the two now see past their pride and into each other's souls, formerly one and the same? Or have the ravages of a bloody war clouded their sight?",0751539406,9780751539400),Paperback,,408 pages,"

Based on Sullivan's years of coaching in which he discovered what motivates people and unlocks their greatest abilities, ""The Laws of Lifetime Growth explains how to use such timeless wisdom as ""Always make your confidence greater than your comfort"" and ""Always make your contribution bigger than your reward."" Sullivan's laws, startling in their simplicity, show readers how to stay focused and firm so that they can continually grow in all areas of life.",1576753352,9781576753354),Hardcover,,127 pages,"

","It sounds like a fairy tale. He is a boy dressed in silks and white wigs and given the finest of classical educations. Raised by a group of rational philosophers known only by numbers, the boy and his mother -- a princess in exile from a faraway land -- are the only persons in their household assigned names. As the boy's regal mother, Cassiopeia, entertains the house scholars with her beauty and wit, young Octavian begins to question the purpose behind his guardians' fanatical studies. Only after he dares to open a forbidden door does he learn the hideous nature of their experiments -- and his own chilling role in them. Set against the disquiet of Revolutionary Boston, M. T. Anderson's extraordinary novel takes place at a time when American Patriots rioted and battled to win liberty while African slaves were entreated to risk their lives for a freedom they would never claim. The first of two parts, this deeply provocative novel reimagines the past as an eerie place that has startling resonance for readers today.",0763624020,9780763624026),Hardcover,First Edition,351 pages,"

The novel was first published by Doubleday & Company in March 1956.

","The American Empire has grown too fast, and the fault lines at home are stressed to the breaking point. The war of words between Right and Left has collapsed into a shooting war, though most people just want to be left alone. The battle rages between the high-technology weapons on one side, and militia foot-soldiers on the other, devastating the cities, and overrunning the countryside. But the vast majority, who only want the killing to stop and the nation to return to more peaceful days, have technology, weapons and strategic geniuses of their own. When the American dream shatters into violence, who can hold the people and the government together? And which side will you be on?Orson Scott Card is a master storyteller, who has earned millions of fans and reams of praise for his previous science fiction and fantasy novels. Now he steps a little closer to the present day with this chilling look at a near future scenario of a new American Civil War.",0765316110,9780765316110),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

""Leaving London in the late 1990s to take up the 'Law of Return' promised by Israel to Jews throughout the world, Susan Nathan is amazed to discover that one in five Israelis is not Jewish but Palestinian, the remnants of the country's Arab population expelled in the 1948 war. She is even more shocked to find that none of her Jewish acquaintances have friends among their Arab fellow citizens. So she chooses to make a further journey across the country's deep ethnic divide to live in Tamra, a town of 25,000 Muslims between Haifa and Nazareth in the Galilee."" Here she starts to see life in Israel through Arab eyes and experiences at first hand the daily discrimination exercised by the Jewish state against its Arab citizens - in education, employment, land ownership and local politics. Having been a regular visitor to apartheid-era South Africa, where her father was born, she is quickly aware of certain comparisons, but now begins, with the help of Arab and Jewish friends, to explore practical ways to establish a more just society.",0007195109,9780007195107),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Now with Temple of a Thousand Faces, he brings to life the legendary temple of Angkor Wat, an unrivaled marvel of ornately carved towers and stone statues. There, in a story set nearly a thousand years ago, an empire is lost, a royal love is tested, and heroism is reborn. When his land is taken by force, Prince Jayavar of the Khmer people narrowly escapes death at the hands of the conquering Cham king. Exiled from their homeland, he and his mystical wife Ajadevi set up a secret camp in the jungle with the intention of amassing an army bold enough to reclaim their kingdom and free their people. Meanwhile, Cham King Indravarman rules with an iron fist, pitting even his most trusted men against each other and squashing any hint of rebellion. Moving from a poor fisherman's family whose sons find the courage to take up arms against their oppressors, to a beautiful bride who becomes a prize of war, to an ambitious warrior whose allegiance is torn--Temple of a Thousand Faces is an unforgettable saga of love, betrayal, and survival at any cost.

Once individuals learn to accept responsibility, they can use the Oz Principle to become better leaders.

","Charles John Huffam Dickens (1812-1870), also known as ""Boz,"" was the foremost English novelist of the Victorian era, as well as a vigorous social campaigner. Considered one of the English language's greatest writers, he was acclaimed for his rich storytelling and memorable characters, and achieved massive worldwide popularity in his lifetime. The popularity of his novels and short stories has meant that not one has ever gone out of print. Dickens wrote serialised novels, the usual format for fiction at the time, and each new part of his stories was eagerly anticipated by the reading public. Among his best-known works are Sketches by Boz (1836), The Pickwick Papers (1837), Oliver Twist (1838), Nicholas Nickleby (1839), Barnaby Rudge (1841), A Christmas Carol (1843), Martin Chuzzlewit (1844), David Copperfield (1850), Bleak House (1853), Little Dorrit (1857), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), Great Expectations (1861) and Our Mutual Friend (1865).",1406554863,9781406554861),Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Koniec mýtov o živote, vzťahoch a citoch homosexuálov! Drsný a trpký, no aj kruto úprimný príbeh mladého muža, ktorý sa rozhodol priznať, že je gay. Ale čo tí ostatní v jeho okolí s podobným ""tajomstvom""?Prvý slovenský román otvorene hovoriaci o sexuálnej menšine, ktorú stále nezmyselne odmietajú, odsudzujú a démonizujú.Boris je obyčajný mladý muž pracujúci v obyčajnej redakcii kdesi v hlavnom meste. Je gay, čo však o ňom jeho kolegovia netušia. Vie to len jeho priateľ Marko a osadenstvo homosexuálneho klubu, do ktorého sporadicky chodieva. Marko však Borisovi nečakane oznámi, že sa budú musieť prestať stýkať, pretože sa ide ženiť. Rozchod, navyše za takýchto nepochopiteľných pohnútok, Borisa bolestivo zasiahne. Nielenže Marko svoju homosexualitu tajil aj pred najbližšou rodinou, ešte sa aj rozhodol rešpektovať „klasický“ spôsob života, aby svoju orientáciu pred všetkými dokonale zakamufloval a vyhovel svojej rodine.Boris citlivo vníma, ako sa mnohým jeho homosexuálnym kamarátom či kamarátkam rúcajú vzťahy a drasticky menia životy práve pod tlakom heterosexuálneho okolia. Keď do Borisovho života nečakane vstúpi mladý lekár Michal, príťažlivý, vnímavý, citlivý a empatický muž, Boris odmieta pokračovať v klamstve a rozhodne sa priznať so svojou homosexualitou najbližšiemu a najmilovanejšiemu človeku - svojej mame. Nástojí, aby Michal urobil to isté, no ten má s priznaním oveľa väčšie problémy. Jeho rodina žije v malom meste, on sám má veľmi dobré postavenie v nemocnici, a tak sa obáva, že priznanie k homosexualite by mu zničilo nielen rodinné vzťahy, ale aj pracovnú kariéru.Na pohľad idylický vzťah Borisa a Michala sa skomplikuje, keď sa do hry nečakane vracia prvá Borisova láska - Marko.Marko uväznený v nevyhovujúcom vzťahu začína chápať, akého omylu sa dopustil, a snaží sa svoj život ešte raz definitívne zmeniť...",Slovak,Slovak,Paperback,,256 pages,"

However, the past is never far behind and the danger posed by an angry ex' continues to put both Ben and Mary in consistent peril.What sets this apart from other books of a similar genre is the exacting details as offered by the author and the subsequent way in which the reader is thoroughly engaged in the escapades of this threesome. Ben is clearly not only protector to Mary, but also has a vested interest in digging deep to the bottom of what motivates Donald. His rival is interested in Mary not just for pure and romantic reasons, but she is integral to a larger plot that Donald has hatched via his diamond dealings. In fact, Donald is confident that Mary knows a bit too much about his illicit transactions and thus she must be dealt with appropriately.",English,English,Paperback,,350 pages,"

","Wolfsangel is a historical novel based on the exploits of German commando Carl Hansen, whose Das Reich Division is recalled from the frozen wastelands of Western Russia to thwart the Allied invasion forces in 1944 Normandy. His love affair with his college sweetheart, French heiress Angelique Dagineau, becomes his reason to survive the cataclysmic battle ahead as the French Resistance rises across Southern France in a stalwart effort to block the Division from joining the fray. The tangled web of intrigue between the corrupt Vichy government forces, the Parisian criminal network and the Communist insurgents combine to add to the dangers facing Carl in completing his mission and returning to Angie at last. His situation grows more compromised as he receives word that Angie is missing and might be the target of a massive Gestapo manhunt for Underground operatives.

The first readers, including Dickens and Thackeray, were struck by its humorous irony, the truthfulness of its presentation of the lives of ordinary men and women, and its compassionate acceptance of human weakness.The three stories that make up the Scenes, ‘The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton', ‘Mr Gilfil's Love Story', and ‘Janet's Repentance', foreshadow George Eliot's major work, and their success gave her the confidence to become one of the greatest English novelists.",019283780X,9780192837806),Paperback,Oxford World's Classics,310 pages,"

","Out of nowhere, like a breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and “The Work.” In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is.Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls “a lover of reality.”",1400045371,9781400045372),Paperback,,352 pages,"

Driven by a quest to follow in the steps of those men who have served as his father figures, uncertain if he’s finding his mind or losing it, Shawn enters the world of professional wrestling and the many identities it has to offer. This story lays bare Shawn’s loss, his quest and self-discovery amidst the chaotic world of professional wrestling. Many people may look at Los Angeles as a place of shallow dreams, just as many may thumb their nose at pro wrestling. But Shawn’s journey reveals otherwise. The art form that is professional wrestling, along with the backdrop of Los Angeles, is an invitation for all to confront, laugh, cry, and to finally accept with gratitude this crazy ride called life.",English,English,ebook,,46 pages,"

","The first book in a trilogy about the most important events in the history of the Order of the Knights Templar. The Templars represent a widely popular period of history at the moment, but the roots of their fellowship have been shrouded in contemporary conspiracy theory and media glamour!.this trilogy tells the true tales of the Knights Templar; beginning with why they formed after the First Crusade and why they continued to grow in power and influence. Immediately after the deliverance of Jerusalem, the Crusaders, considering their vow fulfilled, drifted back to their homes. But some considered that the defence of this precarious conquest, surrounded as it was by Mohammedan neighbours, still remained. In 1118, during the reign of Baldwin II, Hugues de Payens, a knight of Champagne, and eight of his companions bound themselves by a perpetual vow, taken in the presence of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, to defend the Christian kingdom and all god fearing pilgrims who wished to visit the Holy Land. Baldwin accepted their services and assigned them a portion of his palace, adjoining the temple of the city; hence their title ""pauvres chevaliers du temple"" (Poor Knights of the Temple).",0399153969,9780399153969),Hardcover,,576 pages,"

The crew have enemies dating back to the 1st generation. But who wants the crew to lose? Who’s life’s work had it become to dismantle the Cleveland crew? Those questions are yet to be answered. It’s a fact that every generation has at least 1 man who stands out as the best leader. One who is strong in his convictions, unwavering in his decisions and truly in control of any relationship he’s apart of.Both Allen Saul Williams and Allen Devante’ Jackson Sr were leaders in the Civil Rights Era. Big John and big Al are both viewed that way in the 2nd generation. But in the 3rd generation, there are two, as well.Big Chill is the named leader of the 3rd generation. There was an attempt made on his life in 1993, while the man seen as his sibling had to be away, bettering himself in college. But was Chill really the main target? Or was the hit on him meant to be a mental weight on Anthony “Ajay” Jackson?Many view Ajay as the key to prolonging the crews dominance into the new millennium. And they would be absolutely correct. An attempt on his life was made the following year. Of course, it was unsuccessful. But afterwards, a powerful man made his presence known and he moved his money and his prominence around to establish an invisible shield around the crew. His name is Bert Parkwood.

Schon bald empfindet Sophia mehr als nur Faszination für den gut aussehenden Kämpfer mit dem aufbrausenden Temperament, und auch diesem ist sie trotz zahlreicher Auseinandersetzungen keinesfalls gleichgültig.

Henry is different from any other guy Amy has ever known. And after several meetings in the clearing, she’s starting to fall for him.But Amy is stunned when she finds out just how different Henry really is.

","From leadership expert, former Navy SEAL, ""American Grit"" feature player, and author of Worth Dying For: A Navy SEAL's Call to a Nation, Rorke Denver, the bestselling account of how he helped create the U.S. Navy SEALS of today. Rorke Denver trains the men who become Navy SEALs--the most creative problem solvers on the modern battlefield, ideal warriors for the kinds of wars America is fighting now. With his years of action-packed mission experience and a top training role, Lieutenant Commander Denver understands exactly how tomorrow's soldiers are recruited, sculpted, motivated, and deployed.Now, Denver takes you inside his personal story and the fascinating, demanding SEAL training program he now oversees. He recounts his experience evolving from a young SEAL hopeful pushing his way through Hell Week, into a warrior engaging in dangerous stealth missions across the globe, and finally into a lieutenant commander directing the indoctrination, requalification programs, and the ""Hero or Zero"" missions his SEALs undertake.From his own SEAL training and missions overseas, Denver details how the SEALs' creative operations became front and center in America's War on Terror-and how they are altering warfare everywhere. In fourteen years as a SEAL officer, Rorke Denver tangled with drug lords in Latin America, stood up to violent mobs in Liberia, and battled terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan. Leading 200 commando missions, he earned the Bronze Star with V for valor. He has also served as flag aide to the admiral in charge and spent the past four years as executive officer of the Navy Special Warfare Center's Advanced Training Command in Coronado, California, directing all phases of the basic and advanced training that prepare men for war in SEAL teams. He recently starred in the film Act of Valor. He is married and has two daughters.Ellis Henican is a columnist at Newsday and an on-air commentator at the Fox News Channel. He has written two recent New York Times bestsellers, Home Team with New Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton and In the Blink of an Eye with NASCAR legend Michael Waltrip.With all the SEALs' recent successes, we have been getting a level of acclaim we're not used to. But something important has been missing in this warm burst of publicity . Correcting that is my mission here.My own SEAL dream was launched by a book. My hope is that this one teaches lessons that go far beyond the battlefield, inspiring a fresh generation of warriors to carry on that dream.-Lieutenant Commander Rorke Denver",English,English,Hardcover,,304 pages,"

Peek.Seventeen-year-old Ari Alexander just broke that rule and saw the last person she expected hovering above her bed — arrogant Jackson Locke, the most popular boy in her school. She expects instant execution or some kind of freak alien punishment, but instead, Jackson issues a challenge: help him, or everyone on Earth will die.Ari knows she should report him, but everything about Jackson makes her question what she’s been taught about his kind. And against her instincts, she’s falling for him. But Ari isn’t just any girl, and Jackson wants more than her attention. She’s a military legacy who’s been trained by her father and exposed to war strategies and societal information no one can know — especially an alien spy, like Jackson. Giving Jackson the information he needs will betray her father and her country, but keeping silent will start a war.",1620610914,9781620610916),Paperback,,284 pages,"

","From Martha Gellhorn's critically acclaimed biographer, the first collected letters of this defining figure of the twentieth-centuryMartha Gellhorn's heroic career as a reporter brought her to the front lines of virtually every significant international conflict between the Spanish Civil War and the end of the Cold War. While Gellhorn's wartime dispatches rank among the best of the century, her personal letters are their equal: as vivid and fascinating as anything she ever published. Gellhorn's correspondence from 1930 to 1996--chronicling friendships with figures as diverse as Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, and H. G. Wells, as well as her tempestuous marriage to Ernest Hemingway--paint a vivid picture of the twentieth century as she lived it. Caroline Moorehead, who was granted exclusive access to the letters, has expertly edited this fascinating volume, providing prefatory and interstitial material that contextualizes Gellhorn's correspondence within the arc of her entire life. The letters introduce us to the woman behind the correspondent--a writer of wit, charm, and vulnerability. The result is an exhilarating, intimate portrait of one of the most accomplished women of modern times. ",0805065555,9780805065558),Hardcover,,531 pages,"

","A horse's life can be filled with love and tenderness. It can also be filled with meanness and cruelty. Black Beauty learns both sides of life in this classic tale by Anna Sewel. Told from the horse's point of view, Black Beauty's own story takes you into the mind and heart of a sensitive animal searching for love and understanding. From happy times as a young foal romping with his mother, Duchess, to harsh years as a cab horse in the city and finally to a peaceful old age, Black Beauty's life shows that horses have feelings too, and sometimes they even know things people don't.",English,English,Hardcover,Great Illustrated Classics,240 pages,"

","The End of the Civil War is a fast-paced western/murder mystery/war story that plays out in the American West soon after the supposed end of Civil War. It asks the question, what would happen if some Confederates had refused to give up and instead moved West to form alliances with anti-American militants? The story begins when a Confederate general known for his ruthless tactics in the war suddenly appears in the West along with his loyal company of men. When the general begins to wreak havoc in California and Arizona, famous San Francisco detective, Drew Steele, is hired to be a go-between negotiator. The cat-and-mouse game that ensues leads from California, through Mexico, and into the mountains of Arizona. It pits two brilliant minds against each other in a life and death struggle against a backdrop of spectacular Western scenery.",Drew,#2,Paperback,,296 pages,"

","Román se odehrává v 19. století a sleduje osudy lehkomyslného, zhýralého a zchudlého hraběte Arca, jemuž příchod moderní doby sebral jeho nejmilejší hračky - ženy, a nabídl zábavu novou: heroin.Praha před koncem 19. století. Asanační násilí páchané na městě se odráží ve vyvražďování prostitutek v židovském ghettu. Souvislost mezi úmrtími je však třeba teprve hledat, po stopě zločinců jde jednak policie, jednak Karel Adam, hrabě Arco, jejž se smrt dívek dotýká osobně a který je sám stravován těžkou nemocí dýchacích cest. Do neklidného období protivládních demonstrací a konfidentských provokací přijíždí z jedné strany, z Tyrol, Adamův bratránek Mani, a ze strany druhé, z Moravy, neznámý stařec doprovázející neskutečně krásnou dívku, o níž se v Praze začíná šeptat jako o židovské princezně, ale kterou Adam při prvním setkání nepozná. Navíc se ve městě objeví Felix Hofman, lékař a chemik z Bayerových závodů, který s sebou přivezl zázračný lék proti černému kašli a souchotinám, prášek plný heroické síly a smrtelného nebezpečí. Hrabě Arco se k němu snaží dostat, zároveň se pokouší zachránit alespoň jeden barokní dům na rozhraní Starého Města a Josefova, k tomu soupeří s policií v tom, kdo dříve odhalí vraha prostitutek a jeho motivy. Mezi tím se pod nátlakem moderních bouracích strojů poroučí jeden dům za druhým a v ruinách Židovského Města se po nocích zjevuje legendární fantom z dětských báchorek, Masíčko, před jehož dlouhým nožem je lépe co nejdál uprchnout.",9788025700877,9788025700877,Hardcover,,361 pages,"

","Welcome to the Philippines, where the men are five foot five, the everyman's Air Jordans are a pair of flip-flops, and the rhythm of life is punctuated by the bouncing of a basketball.Rafe Bartholomew arrived in Manila with little more than a Fulbright scholarship and an urban legend that Filipinos loved basketball more than anyone else on the planet. He'd heard that the locals constructed jerry-rigged hoops out of any material they could get their hands on-car hoods, driftwood, twisted rebar-and built courts everywhere, from cluttered street corners to the slopes of volcanoes and in the thick of jungles.Allured by the idea of an island nation full of people who love the game as irrationally as he does, American journalist Rafe Bartholomew arrived in Manila to unlock the riddle of basketball's grip on the Philippines. On his unforgettable journey, Bartholomew spends a season inside the locker room of a Philippine professional team, dines with politicians who exploit hoops for electoral success, travels with a troupe of midgets and transsexuals who play exhibition games at rural fiestas, and even acts in a local soap opera. Sweating his way through hard-fought games of 3-on-3, played with homemade hoops for 50-cent wagers, Bartholomew uses a mix of journalistic knowhow and the hard- court ethics he learned from his dad to get in the paint and behind the scenes of Filipinos' against-all-odds devotion to the sport.",0451229991,9780451229991),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","The quadrivium-the classical curriculum-comprises the four liberal arts of number, geometry, music, and cosmology. It was studied from antiquity to the Renaissance as a way of glimpsing the nature of reality. Geometry is number in space; music is number in time; and comology expresses number in space and time. Number, music, and geometry are metaphysical truths: life across the universe investigates them; they foreshadow the physical sciences.Quadrivium is the first volume to bring together these four subjects in many hundreds of years. Composed of six successful titles in the Wooden Books series-Sacred Geometry, Sacred Number, Harmonograph, The Elements of Music, Platonic & Archimedean Solids, and A Little Book of Coincidence-it makes ancient wisdom and its astonishing interconnectedness accessible to us today.Beautifully produced in six different colors of ink, Quadrivium will appeal to anyone interested in mathematics, music, astronomy, and how the universe works.",0802778135,9780802778130),Hardcover,,415 pages,"

","Two Hearts, One God. Should Anything Else Matter?Zora Nella Hampton Johnson knows exactly where she comes from—and her daddy won't let her forget. Of course for that privilege he keeps her in Prada and Kate Spade, Coach and YSL. He chooses her boyfriend, her car, her address, and ignores her love of painting, art, and the old ways of her grandaddy's soulful AME church—where the hymns pleaded, cajoled, and raised the roof. Her daddy may be a preacher, but some-where among the thousands of church members, the on-site coffee house, and the JumboTron, Zora lost God. And she wants Him back.Nicky Parker, a recent graduate of Berkeley and reformed playboy, also suffers the trials of being a preacher's kid, and he can't remember the last time he saw eye-to-eye with his white, racist, Southern Baptist father. What he does remember—and it will be forever burned in his brain despite myriad prayers to Jesus—is the way Zora looked the first time he saw her. Like Nefertiti. Only better. When they meet at a bible study far from their respective home churches, the first churlish, sarcastic sparks that fly sizzle with defensiveness. But God has a special way of feeding the flames and though of different flocks, these two lost sheep will find Him and much, much more.Click Here to listen to an interview with Claudia Mair Burney.",0781445507,9780781445504),Paperback,,389 pages,"

Because even in the perfect family, you never know what is going on behind closed doors...This is what happened...It was a case guaranteed to spark a media feeding frenzy—a young mother, blond and pretty, disappears without a trace from her South Boston home, leaving behind her four-year-old daughter as the only witness and her handsome, secretive husband as the prime suspect.In the last six hours...But from the moment Detective Sergeant D. D. Warren arrives at the Joneses’ snug little bungalow, she senses something off about the picture of wholesome normality the couple worked so hard to create. On the surface, Jason and Sandra Jones are like any other hardworking young couple raising a four-year-old child. But it is just under the surface that things grew murky.Of the world as I knew it...With the clock ticking on the life of a missing woman and the media firestorm building, Jason Jones seems more intent on destroying evidence and isolating his daughter than on searching for his “beloved” wife. Is the perfect husband trying to hide his guilt—or just trying to hide?

","In dieser grandiosen Weltgeschichte des 19. Jahrhunderts erzählt Jürgen Osterhammel kundig, schwungvoll und facettenreich die Geschichte einer Welt im Umbruch. Aus einer Fülle an Material und einer Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Blickwinkel entsteht dabei das tiefgründige Porträt einer faszinierenden Epoche. Osterhammel fragt nach Strukturen und Mustern, markiert Zäsuren und Kontinuitäten, Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede. Seine kulturübergreifenden, thematisch aufgefächerten Darstellungen und Analysen verbinden sich dabei zu einem kühnen Geschichtspanorama, das nicht nur traditionelle eurozentrische Ansätze weit hinter sich läßt, sondern auch erheblich mehr bietet als die gängigen historiographischen Paradigmen wie Industrialisierung oder Kolonialismus. Die Herausbildung unterschiedlicher Wissensgesellschaften, das Verhältnis Mensch-Natur oder der Umgang mit Krankheit und Andersartigkeit kommen darin ebenso zur Sprache wie Besonderheiten der Urbanisierung, verschiedene Formen von Bürgerlichkeit oder die Gegensätze von Migration und Seßhaftigkeit, Anpassung und Revolte, Säkularisierung und Religiosität. Zugleich stellt Osterhammel immer wieder Bezüge zur Gegenwart her.Auf der Höhe der Forschung, engagiert geschrieben und zugleich wohltuend unideologisch, ist sein Werk nicht nur ein unverzichtbares Handbuch für jeden Historiker. Seine plastischen Schilderungen ziehen auch den interessierten Laien in den Bann eines Jahrhunderts, dessen historische Bedeutung in dieser fulminanten Epochengeschichte ganz neu ausgelotet wird.",3406582834,9783406582837),Hardcover,,1568 pages,"

","As the world marks the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, the bestselling novel Generals Die in Bed becomes more relevant than ever. Originally published in 1930, the landmark novel was one of the first to shatter the world’s illusion that war is a glorious endeavour. Instead, this chilling first-hand account brought readers face to face with the brutal, ugly realities of life in the trenches. Often compared to All Quiet on the Western Front and A Farewell to Arms, Generals Die in Bed was described by the New York Times as “a burning, breathing, historic document.” With veterans of WWI no longer here to tell their tales, this book stands as a lasting monument to the horror of war.",1554510732,9781554510733),Paperback,,176 pages,"

Only the miraculous arrival of Arthur, heir to the Pendragon dynasty, allows Guenevere to claim her mother's throne. Smitten by the bold, sensuous princess, Arthur offers to marry her and unite their territories, allowing her to continue to reign in her own right. Their love match creates the largest and most powerful kingdom in the Isles. Yet even the glories of Camelot are not safe from the shadows of evil and revenge. Arthur is reunited with his long-lost half-sisters, Morgause and Morgan, princesses torn from their mother and their ancestral right by Arthur's father, the brutal and unscrupulous King Uther. Both daughters will avenge their suffering, but it is Morgan who strikes the deadliest blows, using her enchantments to destroy all Guenevere holds dear and to force Arthur to betray his Queen.In the chaos that follows, Arthur dispatches a new knight to Guenevere, the young French prince Lancelot, never knowing that Lancelot's passion for the Queen, and hers for him, may be the love that spells ruin for Camelot.",0609806505,9780609806500),Paperback,,544 pages,"

From an early age, they are both confused and troubled by their attraction to the same sex. Shawn believes that homosexuality is sinful, and a traumatic incident of childhood sexual abuse adds to his guilt and shame. Bobby has an image to maintain and flatly denies the possibility that his same-sex attractions even exist. He's just too cool to be gay. When they finally connect, their preconceptions are suddenly dwarfed by what they feel for each other. They become inseparable and fall deeply in love; however, love doesn't make life easy. Plans are in motion that will surely devastate the young couple. Painful experiences of the past overshadow happy memories, and heartbreaking obstacles loom over the possibility of a future.

","At age thirty-five, Cami Walker was burdened by a battle with multiple sclerosis, a chronic neurological condition that made it difficult for her to walk, work, or enjoy her life. Seeking a remedy for her depression after being hospitalized, she received an uncommon prescription from an African medicine woman: Give to others for 29 days.29 Gifts is the insightful story of the author's life change as she embraces and reflects on the naturally reciprocal process of giving and receiving. Many of Walker's gifts were simple —a phone call, spare change, a Kleenex. Yet the acts were transformative. By Day 29, not only had Walker's health and happiness improved, but she had created a worldwide giving movement.The book also includes personal essays from others whose lives changed for the better by giving, plus pages for the reader to record their own journey. More than a memoir, 29 Gifts offers inspiring lessons on how a simple daily practice of altruism can dramatically alter your outlook on the world.",073821356X,9780738213569),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","John Bradshaw, one of the world's leading dog experts, brings us a compelling insight into what dogs would ask us for, if only they knew how. The dog has been mankind's faithful companion for tens of thousands of years, yet today finds itself in crisis throughout the western world. Until just over a hundred years ago, most dogs worked for their living, and each of the many breeds had become well suited, over countless generations, to the task for which they were bred. Now, in their purely domestic roles we fail to understand their needs. And it is time that someone stood up for dogdom: not the caricature of the wolf in a dog suit, ready to dominate its unsuspecting owner at the first sign of weakness, not the trophy animal that collects rosettes and kudos for its breeder, but the real dog, the pet that just wants to be one of the family and enjoy life. Biologists now know far more about what really makes dogs tick than they did twenty years ago, but this new understanding has been slow to percolate through to owners, and has not yet made enough of a difference to the lives of the dogs themselves. This book is here to set the record straight.",1846142954,9781846142956),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","College-professor-cum-zombie Jack Barnes is a different breed of undead—he can think. In fact, he can even write. And the story he has to tell is a truly disturbing—yet strangely heartwarming—one.Convinced he'll bring about a peaceful coexistence between zombies and humans if he can demonstrate his unique condition to Howard Stein, the man responsible for the zombie virus, Barnes sets off on a grueling cross-country journey to meet his maker. Along the way he recruits a small army of ""super"" zombies that will stop at nothing to reach their goal. There's Guts, the dreadlocked boy who can run like the wind; Joan, the matronly nurse adept at reattaching decaying appendages; Annie, the young girl with a fierce quick-draw; and Ros, who can actually speak. United they embark on an epic quest to attain what all men, women—and, apparently, zombies—yearn for: equality.Brains is a blood-soaked, darkly humorous story that will have readers rooting for Barnes and his zombie posse to the very end.",0061974056,9780061974052),Paperback,,182 pages,"

","Born only five years after Pakistan was created in 1947, Imran Khan has lived his country's history. Undermined by a ruling elite hungry for money and power, Pakistan now stands alone as the only Islamic country with a nuclear bomb, yet it is unable to protect its people from the carnage of regular bombings from terrorists and its own ally, America. Now with the revelation that Pakistan has been the hiding place of Osama bin Laden for several years, that relationship can only grow more strained. How did it reach this flashpoint of instability and injustice with such potentially catastrophic results for Pakistan?Recounting his country's history through the prism of his own memories, Imran Khan starts from its foundation, ripped out of the dying British Raj. He guides us through and comments on subsequent historical developments which shook the Muslim world - the wars with India in 1965 and 1971, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and America's retribution 10 years later with the assassination of bin Laden - to the current controversial and intractable war in Afghanistan.We see these events viewed not only through the eyes of Westerners, but through those of ordinary Pakistanis.Drawing on the experiences of his own family and his wide travels within his homeland, Pakistan: A Personal History provides a unique insider's view of a country unfamiliar to a western audience. Woven into this history we see how Imran Khan's personal life - his happy childhood in Lahore, his Oxford education, his extraordinary cricketing career, his marriage to Jemima Goldsmith, his mother's influence and that of his Islamic faith - inform both the historical narrative and his current philanthropic and political activities. It is at once absorbing and insightful, casting fresh light upon a country whose culture he believes is largely misunderstood by the West.",0593067746,9780593067741),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

After all, there were no more midwives after me.""For generations, the women in Elizabeth's family have brought life to Kettle Valley, West Virginia, heeding a destiny to tend its women with herbals, experience, and wisdom. But Elizabeth, who has comforted so many, has lost her heart to the one man who cannot reciprocate, even when she moves into his home to share his bed and raise his child.Then Lauren Denniker, Elizabeth's adopted daughter, begins to display a miraculous gift--just as Elizabeth learns that she herself is unable to have a child. How Elizabeth comes to free herself from a loveless relationship, grapple with Lauren's astonishing abilities, and come to terms with her own emptiness is the compelling heart of this remarkable tale.

","Jonathan Kellerman says Mallory's Oracle is ""a joy."" Nelson DeMille and other advance readers have called it ""truly amazing, "" ""a classic"" with ""immense appeal."" It is all of that, and more: a stunning debut novel about a web of unsolved murders in New York's Gramercy Park and the singular woman who makes them her obsession.At its center is Kathleen Mallory, an extraordinary wild child turned New York City policewoman. Adopted off the streets as a little girl by a police inspector and his wife, she is still not altogether civilized now that she is a sergeant in the Special Crimes section. With her ferocious intelligence and green gunslinger eyes, Mallory (never Kathleen, never Kathy) operates by her own inner compass of right and wrong, a sense of justice that drives her in unpredictable ways. She is a thing apart.And today, she is a thing possessed. Although more at home in the company of computers than in the company of men, Mallory is propelled onto the street when the body of her adoptive father, Louis Markowitz, is found stabbed in a tenement next to the body of a wealthy Gramercy Park woman. The murders are clearly linked to two other Gramercy Park homicides Markowitz had been investigating, and now his cases become Mallory's, his death her cause. Prowling the streets, sifting through his clues, drawing on his circle of friends and colleagues, she plunges into a netherworld of light and shadow, where people are not what they seem and truth shifts without warning. And a murderer waits who is every bit as wild and unpredictable as she....Filled with deep, seductive atmosphere and razor-sharp prose, Mallory's Oracle is gripping, resonant suspense of tantalizing complexity—a genuinely unforgettable novel.",0515116475,9780515116472),Mass Market Paperback,,329 pages,"

The telltale signs are: flaming cheeks, shortness of breath, bulging eyes, and a prolonged illogical outburst.Gemma Stone is convinced that it's always unseemly to chuck a birkett and that it's actually insane to chuck one in front of a complete stranger. But that was before she fell for a boy who barely knows she exists, before she auditioned for the school play, before she met the family of freaks her sister Debbie is marrying into, before the unpredictable Raven De Head took an interest in her, and before she realized that at the right time and for the right reason, a birkett could be a beautiful thing.",0385735162,9780385735162),Hardcover,,297 pages,"

","Have you ever felt that your presence at a sporting event influenced the result? Are you certain your team could not possibly succeed without you at the game? Do you believe your adherence to a precise routine on game day, whether at the stadium or in your own home, is the key to winning or losing? And if you don't hold to these rituals exactly, do you believe in your heart that your team is doomed? If you are a sports fan, you know about superstitions, curses and hexes. The sporting world is littered with these legends. Some, like the Curse of the Bambino, the Curse of the Billy Goat, or being on the cover of Sports Illustrated, are well known and documented. More recently, there has been a rising swell of evidence supporting the Madden Curse. But there are other stories similar to these that have never been told. This is one of those stories.

He was the founder of the organization known as Comintern (Communist International) and the posthumous source of ""Leninism,"" the doctrine codified and conjoined with Marx's works by Lenin's successors to form Marxism-Leninism, which became the Communist world-view. If the Bolshevik Revolution is - as some people have called it - the most significant political event of the 20th century, then Lenin must for good or ill be regarded as the century's most significant political leader.

If you're like me, you rely on the strength of those you care about and allow them to boost you up when you're down. But what happens when they're no longer around to support you? What happens when you're at your lowest point, and there's no one left to lend you a helping hand? The world may have ended, mine just took a little longer to catch up. I've lost people along the way, some I loved; others I didn't, but the one I've really lost is myself. How, then, can I find the will to go on when all I see is a stranger in the mirror? How do I force myself to breathe when it's so much easier to just wait for something to come and mercifully finish me off? The answer: I'll let you know when I figure it out.****Warning: this novel contains graphic violence, abuse, strong language, and sexual content (both consensual and rape).

","Captured in 1388 in the act of stealing back his own cattle, young Sir William Scott faces hanging, then gets one other choice--to marry immediately his captor's eldest daughter, the lady Margaret Murray, known by all as Muckle-Mouth Meggie. With the line between England and Scotland shifting daily, the Earl of Douglas wants to win back every inch of Scotland that the English have claimed; whereas the equally powerful English Percies (under Hotspur) want to win back the land between Northumberland and Edinburgh; and the Murray family is caught in the middle, shifting its alliances to try to survive. Uncertain whether she is English or Scottish and abruptly married to Sir William who is staunchly loyal to the cause of Scottish independence but who also has promised he'll never take up arms against her family, Meg Murray learns two things: first, Will's word is his bond; second, her favorite brother is spying on Douglas for Hotspur. As Sir Will faces the dilemma of honoring his word to the unscrupulous Murray without betraying Douglas, Meg must choose between betraying the husband with whom she is rapidly falling in love, or betraying her own family and best-loved brother.",044619798X,9780446197984),Mass Market Paperback,1st Edition,392 pages,"

","Dalam pergolakan menjelang dekade abad keenam belas, Kekaisaran Jepang menggeliat dalam kekacau-balauan ketika keshogunan tercerai-berai dan panglima-panglima perang musuh berusaha merebut kemenangan. Benteng-benteng dirusak, desa-desa dijarah, ladang-ladang dibakar.Di tengah-tengah penghancuran ini, muncul tiga orang yang bercita-cita mempersatukan bangsa. Nobunaga yang ekstrem, penuh kharisma, namun brutal. Ieyasu yang tenang, berhati-hati, bijaksana, berani di medan perang, dan dewasa. Namun kunci dari tiga serangkai ini adalah Hideyoshi, si kurus berwajah monyet yang secara tak terduga menjadi juru selamat bagi negeri porak-poranda ini. Ia lahir sebagai anak petani, menghadapu dunia tanpa bekal apapun, namun kecerdasannya berhasil mengubah pelayan yang ragu-ragu menjadi setia, saingan menjadi teman, dan musuh menjadi sekutu. Pengertiannya yang mendalam terhadap sifat dasar manusia telah membuka kunci pintu-pintu gerbang benteng, membuka pikiran orang-orang, dan memikat hati para wanita. Dari seorang pembawa sandal, ia akhirnya menjadi Taiko, penguasa mutlak Kekaisaran Jepang.Taiko merupakan karya besar Eiji Yoshikawa, penulis bestseller internasional, yang berisi pawai sejarah dan kekerasan, pengkhianatan dan pengorbanan diri, kelembutan dan kekejaman.

The personal cost was horrendous. I barely survived the choices I made, and my sanity was pushed to its limits.Still, I finally now have security, peace, and freedom. For the rest of my life I can spend time “making love to the color”, making love to beautiful women, and enjoying the wild nightlife of bohemian Montmartre. What more could a man need or want?Then, one night, I see her. One look at Sophie, and my heart wants to betray me! I try to tell myself that I know better. Who needs love, anyway? I am already married-to my art! No woman would ever understand and accept my lifestyle; nor am I about to give that lifestyle up. Not when I paid so dearly for it! Besides, I am too badly damaged to ever open up my heart…and if Sophie found out about my past she would not want to even know my name. I can’t take that chance.

","The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cycling—and the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong—by former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle.Over the course of two years, Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anything—and take any risk, physical, mental, or moral—to gain the edge they need to win.Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world’s best-liked and top-ranked cyclists—a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stages—and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrong’s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrong’s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by Armstrong’s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacle—winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics—his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport.From the exhilaration of his early, naïve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sport’s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong.A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, The Secret Race is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.",0345530411,9780345530417),Hardcover,,290 pages,"

","The fourteen stories in this book span six decades—from 1903 to 1957 or even later—and represent every phase of Forster's career as a writer. Only two have ever been published, and those only in magazines to which few people have easy access.  Two very different reasons caused the other twelve to remain unpublished in Forster's lifetime. One was his diffidence, which in his earlier years led him to belittle work that had failed to find immediate acceptance. There are four such stories in this volume, and it is hard, today, to understand why they were rejected by the same editors who were publishing his other early work.  The remaining stories were disbarred from publication by their overtly homosexual themes; instead they were shown to an appreciative circle of friends and fellow writers, including Christopher Isherwood, Siegfried Sassoon, Lytton Strachey, and T. E. Lawrence, who considered one story ""the most powerful thing I have ever read."" The stories differ widely. One is a cheerful political satire; another has, most unusually for Forster, a historical setting; a third is the fictional equivalent of one of those comic picture-postcards that so delighted George Orwell. Others give serious and powerful expression to some of Forster's profoundest concerns.  The significance of these stories in relation to Forster's famous abandonment of the novel is discussed by Oliver Stallybrass in his introduction. ""[These stories] are often brilliant, aware both of the strictly contemporary...the contrast between Greek and Christian; between 'Goth' and Christian; between spontaneity and duty in matters sensual and instinctive. In short, they bring up all Forster's usual preoccupations and at the same time orchestrate the new song and play it loud and clear."" —World—From the dust jacket flap",0393304426,9780393304428),Paperback,,264 pages,"

This book focuses on the tenure that took place after the wonderful time of “Khulfa-e-Rashidan” (the four caliphs) which took out the Arabian Peninsula from the darkness of associating ilahs (gods) with Almighty Allah swt. This book discusses the tenure and the reign time of Banu Umaiyyah starting from 40th Hijri to 132nd Hijri year. In this book the author Ibn e Kathir explains the biography of the caliphs, the merits of their ruling times, major and minor events that took place during their reign, the year by year happenings and the transition of the government bodies known as Caliphs. All of the narrations and references are very much authentic as this phase of Islamic history is very much manipulated and distorted by historians of Islam. As Al-Bidayah Wan Nihayah (The Beginning and The End), by the renowned and famous scholar Abu Al-Fida Imad ad-Deen Isma’eel bin Umar ibn Katheer, is considered as one of the most authoritative sources on Islamic History",English,English,Paperback,,560 pages,"

(No pressure.)In order to bring them down, Celia must ally herself to Misha, the master vampire who has made no secret of his desire for her. And if that weren’t enough misfortune for one girl, a clairvoyant’s prediction could destroy Celia and Aric’s love for good. The only way to protect the world from unbridled supernatural terrorism is for Celia to bind herself to her destined mate. And that doesn’t appear to be Aric….",0451416759,9780451416759),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Yaşadığın şehir özgür değilse, sen de özgür kalamazsın!..Byzantion'dan İstanbul'a uzanan heyecan yüklü, tarihsel bir serüven...Yedi hükümdar, yedi kadim mekân, yedi gizemli olay ve yalın bir gerçek!Romanlarında zengin arka planı polisiye kurgu içinde vermekteki ustalığı ile bilinen Ahmet Ümit'in bu romanı da yine peşpeşe işlenen cinayetlerin çevresinde kurgulanmış. Ancak bu kitabı sıradan bir polisiye romandan ayıran birçok özellik var. Her şeyden önce zengin kadrosu ile İstanbul Hatırası, çeşitli kesimlerden İstanbulluyu bir araya getirerek içinde barındırdığı alt öykülerle zengin bir yapı sunuyor. Birbirine bağlanan bu alt öyküler bir yandan gerilimin etkisini artırırken bir yandan da romanı şenlikli ve çok yönlü bir yapıya ulaştırıyor. Kitabın bir başka önemli özelliği de İstanbul hakkında son derece detaylı bilgi içermesi. Kurgunun içine yerleştirilen bu bilgiler hem okumayı daha meraklı hale getiriyor hem de tarih aracılığıyla çok günümüzün dışındaki öykülerin de kurguya yerleşmesine imkan tanıyor. Böylece Ahmet ümit'in İstanbul Hatırası adlı romanı, başka başka dönemlerin öykülerinin eşliğinde, günümüz İstanbul'unun geniş bir panoramasını oluşturuyor. Tutucusundan modernine, eski İstanbullusundan yeni göç etmişine, milliyetçisinden gayrı Müslim'ine varana dek İstanbullu diye adlandırılabilecek herkes bu kitabın içinde kendi öyküleriyle birlikte İstanbul'un devasa çarklarının dişlilerini dile getiriyor. Binlerce yıllık tarihiyle İstanbul başrolü oluştururken romana girip çıkan her karakter de İstanbul'un nasıl İstanbul olduğunu aktarıyor.",9789752897458,9789752897458,Paperback,1st Edition ,565 pages,"

","According to sixteen-year-old Sophie, her new job at Sterlingwood Nursing Home makes perfect sense. Where else could a girl abandoned as a newborn better fit in than with all the other “toss-aways”? But she soon discovers the work is hard, the residents are crazy, and lessons in dying aren’t what she had in mind. Now she wants to quit. An introduction to Miss Mable Rabbit, an elderly woman who refuses to speak, and a co-worker’s cryptic warning to just let the poor woman be, provide Sophie with reason to stay. She’s convinced she’ll be the one to break through the woman’s silence. Winning Miss Rabbit’s trust doesn’t come easy. Overprotective parents, a drill sergeant of a Head Nurse, and a chain-smoking geriatric busybody offer little in the way of help. Sophie’s entire strategy hinges on advice from an unnerving observer – one pesky know-it-all woman, come back from the dead to assist. Her unexpected gift propels Sophie on a journey through a past no one is willing to claim and a reality no one should ever know. As Sophie learns that love often hides behind difficult choices, she tries to help Miss Rabbit find her voice, and in doing so, discovers her own.Showcasing the heart of one generation and the soul of another, THE SECRET MISS RABBIT KEPT is ripe with poignancy and humor. A story of unexpected friendships and second chances, this coming-of-age tale proves that growing up and growing old aren’t so different after all.",English,English,Paperback,,353 pages,"

","Number one best selling book on Amazon in insects category, top 20 in environment and conservation since publication.""If the bee disappears from the earth, man would have no more than four years to live"" Albert Einstein.This beautifully illustrated edition is meant to educate the reader about the potential extinction of the bees as an indicator of a mass extinction, the last one of which was 65 million years ago. It explains what pollination is, who does it, why its essential to us, what things are threatening our pollinators and what we, as individuals, can do about it.They have been in existence for over 100 million years, but it has taken us less than 30 years to kill almost all of them off. Honey bees are responsible for pollinating 60% of the world's food supply. Without them, the human race would face starvation. A worldwide epidemic, it has been called the bee apocalypse by Russia's president, but it is worse in the United States than any other country. Since 1972, feral honey bees in the United States have declined 80% to near extinction, and domestic bees in the United States are down to 60%. Since 2006, the epidemic has been referred to as colony collapse disorder, describing the disappearance of entire colonies of bees.Among the causes cited for this disaster of epidemic proportions are parasites, the decrease in abundance and diversity of wildflowers, insecticides and genetically engineered foods (GMO's) that create their own synthetic pesticides which kill bees as well as other insects. But one thing is for certain-- mankind is responsible for the drastic decline in bee population and the United States government is doing nothing about it. On the contrary, the government has taken measures to make the problem worse.There is more to this delicate 100 million year old evolution of pollination that just honey bees, who were not native to the United States, but imported from Europe and probably originally came from Africa. At least 4,000 species of wild bees are known to exist in North America alone. All of them are at risk, and this book will show you how you can make a difference in saving them, our food supply, and our planet as we know it.50% of the royalties of this book will be donated to Bee Bay, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of bees and the environment.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,119 pages,"

","Minus Orth walks dogs for a living and sculpts for his life. He’s ready to create a unique sculpture cycle — Mythical Gods in Their Twilight. Meanwhile, he has a girlfriend, Belinda, who’s itching to get married. His friend, Peter N, has reaped artistic success that’s both inspirational and a thorn. He plays poker with a quartet of exiled aristocrats. And at Minus’s art co-op, the residents live on the fringe of society. One day Minus crosses paths with Karen Kosek, best remembered as a culture critic of the 1960s. Karen dropped out of sight years ago. Now she dresses as a bag lady — ragged clothes, a garbage smell, and bulging plastic bags she carries as if they hold the secrets to the good life. Minus orchestrates a tenuous relationship with Karen, and discovers in her a woman who has not been trampled underfoot, but is burrowed deeper in society’s crust than anyone could imagine.Thus begins an odyssey in which Minus becomes obsessed with Karen’s past and present, obsessed with creating his sculpture cycle, and with the role artists play in society’s split personality. “Do you have what it takes to make something beautiful?” is a question that comes to the minds of many characters in this story. Their answers are hilarious, confused, self-delusional, virtuous, or simply truthful, because the people who create beauty are different from those who value beauty, and far afield from the powers able to help it flourish … or destroy it.",English,English,Paperback,,400 pages,"

Evvy Hoffmeister is thirteen years old when her family brings her to Loon Lake Sanatorium to get cured of tuberculosis (TB). Evvy is frightened by her new surroundings; the rules to abide are harsh and the nurses equally rigid. But Evvy soon falls into step with the other girls in her ward. There’s Sarah, quiet but thoughtful; Pearl, who adores Hollywood glamour; and Dena, whose harshness conceals a deep strength. Together, the girls brave the difficult daily routines. Set in 1940 at a time of political unrest throughout the U.S. and Europe, this thought-provoking novel sheds light on a much-feared worldwide illness. Hundreds of thousands of people died each year of TB, and many ill children were sent away to sanatoriums to hopefully recover.
This is a masterful novel—both eloquent and moving—that gives voice to those who fought hard to overcome the illness.

","When the mad philosopher Quincas Borba dies, he leaves to his friend Rubiao the entirety of his wealth and property, with a single stipulation: Rubiao must take care of Quincas Borba's dog, who is also named Quincas Borba, and who may indeed have assumed the soul of the dead philosopher. Flush with his newfound wealth, Rubiao heads for Rio de Janeiro and plunges headlong into a world where fantasy and reality become increasingly difficult to keep separate. Brilliantly translated by Gregory Rabassa, Quincas Borba is a masterful satire not only on life in Imperial Brazil but the human condition itself.",0195106822,9780195106824),Paperback,,271 pages,"

","Can Princess Lizzie get her wheels spinning after her magic bike breaks? Leave it to the ingenious, undefeatable royal whiz kid to get back in the bike seat again! The adventures of Princess Lizzie continue with Book 2: Princess Lizzie and the Sabotaged Magic Bicycle. This time, the princess must use her celebrated brains and bravery to make it to the Hotel De Charm in time to spirit away her GANK Award, even though it seems that someone is trying to stop her in her path. Will the mysterious pedal meddler succeed?In Book 2, Princess Lizzie is selected to receive a prestigious GANK, which is the Geeky and Nerdy Kids Award for her math, science, and technological excellence. However, her stomach is in absolute jitters at the thought of standing before everyone to claim her honor. To calm her down, her royal and caring parents send her to the park to ride her magic bike. Along the way, she encounters a band of not-so-friendly animals that are on a mission to make sure Princess Lizzie doesn’t get to the awards ceremony at Hotel De Charm in time. When her magical bike no longer works, it seems there may be a frenemy in the mix who has tinkered with her means of transportation to the ceremony.Among the forest animals is Owl, a musician who clearly has something that he is not hooting about. There is also Raccoon, whose little black paws take what isn’t his. Monkey, Princess Lizzie’s savvy, chatty assistant, remains loyally by her side. Hippopotamus, a dwarf pygmy hippo, is a talented mechanic of magical items, and may just prove invaluable with a messed up magical bike. Can Princess Lizzie figure out friend from foe in enough time to be at the hotel when they call out her name?As children become captivated by Princess Lizzie’s quick mind and able hand with technological gadgets, they will also noodle through some complex interpersonal issues that will help build a foundation for good friendships and values. With humor, heart, high-tech, and plenty of good old-fashioned girl smarts, Book 2: Princess Lizzie and the Sabotaged Magic Bicycle is a delightful joy ride through uncharted terrain in the children’s book and television world. With eye-catching illustrations and sly adult references, parents will be just as enthralled with Princess Lizzie’s escapade. Most important, inquisitive kids will hang on every princess-powered page, while they just might learn a new way of seeing the world’s limitless possibilities for boys and girls!",The,#2,Paperback,,26 pages,"

"," From Katrina Kittle, critically acclaimed author of The Kindness of Strangers, comes a wry and moving story of forgiveness, flexibility, happiness, and the art of moving on.   Veterinarian Cami Anderson has hit a rough patch. Stymied by her recent divorce, she wonders if there are secret ingredients to a happy, long-lasting marriage or if the entire institution is outdated and obsolete. Couples all around her are approaching important milestones. Her parents are preparing to celebrate their fiftieth anniversary. Her brother and his partner find their marriage dreams legally blocked. Her former sister-in-law—still her best friend—is newly engaged. The youthfully exuberant romance of her teenage daughter is developing complications. And three separate men—including her ex-husband—are becoming entangled in Cami's messy post-marital love life.   But as she struggles to come to terms with her own doubts amid this chaotic circus of relationships, Cami finds strange comfort in an unexpected confidant: an angry, unpredictable horse in her care. With the help of her equine soul mate, she begins to make sense of marriage's great mysteries—and its disconnects. ",B003TLN0JK,B003TLN0JK,Kindle Edition,,,"

","This book offers a complete translation of the Majjhima Nikaya, or Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. This collection--among the oldest records of the historical Buddha's original teachings--consists of 152 suttas or discourses of middle length, distinguished as such from the longer and shorter suttas of the other collections. The Majjhima Nikaya might be concisely described as the Buddhist scripture that combines the richest variety of contextual settings with the deepest and most comprehensive assortment of teachings. These teachings, which range from basic ethics to instructions in meditation and liberating insight, unfold in a fascinating procession of scenarios that show the Buddha in living dialogue with people from many different strata of ancient Indian society: with kings and princes, priests and ascetics, simple villagers and erudite philosophers. Replete with drama, reasoned argument, and illuminating parable and simile, these discourses exhibit the Buddha in the full glory of his resplendent wisdom, majestic sublimity, and compassionate humanity.The translation is based on an original draft translation left by the English scholar-monk Bhikkhu Nanamoli, which has been edited and revised by the American monk Bhikkhu Bodhi, who provides a long introduction and helpful explanatory notes. Combining lucidity of expression with accuracy, this translation enables the Buddha to speak across twenty-five centuries in language that addresses the most pressing concerns of the contemporary reader seeking clarification of the timeless issues of truth, value, and the proper conduct of life.Winner of the 1995 Choice Magazine Outstanding Academic Book Award, and the Tricycle Prize for Excellence in Buddhist Publishing for Dharma Discourse.",086171072X,9780861710720),Hardcover,,1424 pages,"

","It is elk season in the Rockies, but this year a different kind of hunter is stalking a different kind of prey. When the call comes in on the radio, Joe Pickett can hardly believe his ears: game wardens have found a hunter dead at a camp in the mountains; strung up, gutted, and flayed, as if he were the elk he'd been pursuing. A spent cartridge and a poker chip lie next to his body. Ripples of horror spread through the community, and with a possibly psychotic killer on the loose Governor Rulon is forced to end the hunting season early for the first time in state history. Are the murders the work of a deranged antihunting activist or of a lone psychopath with a personal vendetta? As always, Joe Pickett is the governor's go-to man, and he�s put on the case to track the murderous hunter, as more bodies and poker chips turn up. Bold, fast-paced, and with a controversial hook-hunting versus antihunting activists. Blood Trail is proof that C. J. Box is an ever-rising talent.",0399154884,9780399154881),Hardcover,,301 pages,"

","Throughout the galaxy, it was believed that Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker the Chosen One had died on Coruscant during the siege of the Jedi Temple. And, to some extent, that was true. Anakin was dead. From the site of Anakin Skywalker s last stand on the molten surface of the planet Mustafar, where he sought to destroy his friend and former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi a fearsome specter in black has risen. Once the most powerful Knight ever known to the Jedi Order, he is now a disciple of the dark side, a lord of the dreaded Sith, and the avenging right hand of the galaxy s ruthless new Emperor. Seduced, deranged, and destroyed by the machinations of the Dark Lord Sidious, Anakin Skywalker is dead . . . and Darth Vader lives. Word of the events that created him the Jedi Council s failed mutiny against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the self-crowned Emperor s retaliatory command to exterminate the Jedi Order, and Anakin s massacre of his comrades and Masters in the Jedi Temple has yet to reach all quarters. On the Outer Rim world of Murkhana, Jedi Masters Roan Shryne and Bol Chatak and Padawan Olee Starstone are leading a charge on a Separatist stronghold, unaware that the tide, red with Jedi blood, has turned suddenly against them. When the three narrowly elude execution and become the desperate prey in a hunt across space it s neither clone soldiers, nor the newly deployed stormtroopers, nor even the wrath of the power-hungry Emperor himself they must fear most. The deadliest threat rests in the hideously swift and lethal crimson lightsaber of Darth Vader behind whose brooding mask lies a shattered heart, a poisoned soul, and a cunning, twisted mind hell-bent on vengeance. For the handful of scattered Jedi, survival is imperative if the light side of the Force is to be protected and the galaxy somehow, someday reclaimed. Yet more important still is the well-being of the twin infants, Leia and Luke Skywalker, the children of Anakin and his doomed bride, Padme Amidala. Separated after Padme s death, they must be made safe at all costs, lest the hope they represent for the future be turned to horror by the new Sith regime and the unspeakable power of the dark side.

The two shots that rang out at Mayerling in the Vienna Woods echo still.Frederic Morton, author of the bestselling Rothschilds, deftly tells the haunting story of the Prince and his city, where, in the span of only ten months, ""the Western dream started to go wrong."" In Rudolf's Vienna moved other young men with striking intellectual and artistic talents—and all as frustrated as the Prince. Among them were: young Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Theodor Herzl, Gustav Klimt, and the playwright Arthur Schnitzler, whose La Ronde was the great erotic drama of the fin de siecle. Morton studies these and other gifted young men, interweaving their fates with that of the doomed Prince and the entire city through to the eve of Easter, just after Rudolf's body is lowered into its permanent sarcophagus and a son named Adolf Hitler is born to Frau Klara Hitler.",Vienna,(Austria),Paperback,1986 reprint,340 pages,"

After days of fruitless effort, the search-and-rescue team has little hope that she’ll be found alive, if at all. Cork O’Connor, former sheriff and now private investigator, is part of that team.Early on, Cork notices small things about the woman’s disappearance that disturb him. But when the beloved pet dog of a friend is brutally killed and beheaded, he begins to see a startling pattern in these and other recent dark occurrences in the area. After his own son comes close to peril, Cork understands that someone is spinning a deadly web in Tamarack County. At the center is a murder more than twenty years old, for which an innocent man may have been convicted. Cork remembers the case only too well. He was the deputy in charge of the investigation that sent the man to prison.With the darkest days of the year at hand, the storms of winter continue to isolate Tamarack County. Somewhere behind the blind of all that darkness and drifting snow, a vengeful force is at work. And Cork has only hours to stop it before his family and his friends pay the ultimate price for the sins of others.With complex plot twists, rich characters, and a vivid setting, Tamarack County is a relentlessly fast-paced novel that will chill, thrill, and shock you.",1451645783,9781451645781),ebook,,320 pages,"

So why is it that she breaks into a sweat whenever she pictures Blake announcing their engagement at his parent’s annual rodeo? Jessica is doing a good job of ignoring her doubts until Mark Fripp, the boy she fell in love with ten years ago, shows up on his motorcycle to fulfill his mother’s dying wish.

","Originally censored by its British publisher, The Beach at Falesá is a scathing critique of colonialism and economic imperialism that bravely takes on many of the 19th Century’ s strongest taboos: miscegenation, imperialism, and economic exploitation. It does so with a story that features a surprising and beguiling romance between an adventurous British trader and a young island girl, against a background of increasing—and mysterious—hostility. Are the native islanders plotting against the couple, or is it the other white traders? The result is a denouement that is astonishing in its violence. Told in the unadorned voice of the trader, it is a story that deftly combines the form of the exotic adventure yarn with the moral and psychological questing of great fiction.",0976140713,9780976140719),Paperback,,124 pages,"

","What if our civilization is more advanced than we know?The New York Times bestselling author of Daemon imagines a world in which decades of technological advances have been suppressed in an effort to prevent disruptive change.Are smart phones really humanity's most significant innovation since the moon landings? Or can something else explain why the bold visions of the 20th century--fusion power, genetic enhancements, artificial intelligence, cures for common disease, extended human life, and a host of other world-changing advances--have remained beyond our grasp? Why has the high-tech future that seemed imminent in the 1960's failed to arrive?Perhaps it did arrive...but only for a select few.Particle physicist Jon Grady is ecstatic when his team achieves what they've been working toward for years: a device that can reflect gravity. Their research will revolutionize the field of physics--the crowning achievement of a career. Grady expects widespread acclaim for his entire team. The Nobel. Instead, his lab is locked down by a shadowy organization whose mission is to prevent at all costs the social upheaval sudden technological advances bring. This Bureau of Technology Control uses the advanced technologies they have harvested over the decades to fulfill their mission.They are living in our future.Presented with the opportunity to join the BTC and improve his own technology in secret, Grady balks, and is instead thrown into a nightmarish high-tech prison built to hold rebellious geniuses like himself. With so many great intellects confined together, can Grady and his fellow prisoners conceive of a way to usher humanity out of its artificial dark age?And when they do, is it possible to defeat an enemy that wields a technological advantage half a century in the making?",0525953183,9780525953180),Hardcover,,406 pages,"

","Nothing in this world is permanent. Friends, lovers, even family, can all disappear in the blink of an eye. Without these anchors, it's all too easy to find oneself drifting.


Jason Grant doesn't have much, aside from a beat-up old guitar and knack for getting kicked out of foster homes. His latest placement is set to be just another in a long line of failures. Then he meets Caesar Hubbard, a handsome guy who lives down the hall. For the first time in his life, Jason wants to stay, which means learning to be part of a family, and not letting his feelings--or his actions--ruin his first real chance of falling in love.Something Like Spring introduces a new character to the Seasons story, one with a troubled past and an equally turbulent future. Jason must traverse a winding road fraught with emotional conflicts and tough decisions... a road that might just lead to a certain couple in Austin. The Something Like...

Taking emergency calls, it becomes immediately obvious that the entire city is infected with the walking dead. His first goal is to reach and save his two children.

Prepared for battle, Michaela and her Archangels open Heaven’s gates to confront the fallen. Only, Michaela’s Archangels—her brothers and sisters in Heaven—betray her. And when the fallen attack the sanctuary in the skies through the gates Michaela inadvertently left open, the holy angels accuse Michaela of planning the invasion.  One simple mistake with a thousand consequences.  Dragged to Earth by an Archangel turned fallen, Michaela will do anything to return to Heaven and save it. In her fervor, she kills the Archangel—something no angel has ever done before. Wingless, without any hope, Michaela welcomes death when an unlikely human ally, Clark, finds her. With the help of Clark and Gabriel, an innocent Archangel whose friendship deepens into something far more torrid and unexpected on Earth, Michaela must prove the holy angels have their own plan for Heaven, and it is one that may prove to be the End of the Days.  It may be too late to save herself, but Michaela is the only one who knows the truth about the holy angels. If she fails, she may never be able to return to Heaven.

","This book written by a scholar and a retired professor of modern history at King Saud University in Riyadh, Abdullah al-Uthaimın. It consists of the almost unchanged text of his doctoral thesis submitted to the University of Edinburgh in 1972. It is essential reading for scholars researching the early Wahhabi movement and the Saudi principality of al-Dir‘ı¯ya, or the ﬁrst Saudi state, especially the study of the life and doctrine of Muhammad Ibn Abdul Wahhab. The Saudi religious reform movement of the 18th and 19th centuries, known in the west as Wahhabism, is one of the most controversial and misunderstood religious movements of the modern Middle East. This biography of its founder, Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, is the first serious English-language account written not from a Western, but an Arabian perspective. Based on exhaustive research of primary sources, Abd-Allah Salih Al-Uthaimin reconstructs the social, political and spiritual environment of the Arabian peninsula in the time of Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab. The author charts this movement's intellectual development and growing sway, and unpicks the historic alliance of its founder with the House of Al-Saud: a uniquely close partnership of political and religious relationships whose legacy is felt in the Saudi state to this day. Al-Uthaimin also provides a detailed exposition and commentary on Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab's doctrines, based on his published and unpublished works, and explains his perspective on concepts such as tawhid, takfir and sharia. This meticulously researched biography offers a unique insight into its complex and often controversial subject. As such, it will become essential reading for anyone interested in political Islam, Saudi Arabia and the modern Middle East.http://worldcat.org/entity/work/id/79...",1845117913,9781845117917),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","Jurgos Ivanauskaitės „Stebuklinga Spanguolė“ – pasaka mažiesiems skaitytojams. Čia atgyja gamta, jos kuždesys įgyja regimą kūną, girdimą balsą paukščių sparnais, gėlių vainikais pasipuošusiuose veikėjuose. Jie gyvena kvepiančių čiobrelių kilimais apklotose pilyse, vėjuotame gamtos būtybių balse ir, svarbiausia, Lietuvos rubinais – spanguolėmis, nusėtame raiste. Spanguolė kūrinyje yra visur, ji atveria ir užbaigia jo siužetą. Paragavęs stebuklingos spanguolės kūrinio pagrindinis herojus Algiukas pakliūva į Lietuvos motinos gamtos karalystę, kurioje sutinka žvėrių, paukščių, augalų, vėjo, vandens, ugnies galiomis apdovanotų fantastinių veikėjų. Kūrinyje kalbama apie draugystę tarp žmogaus ir gamtos. Draugystei, buvimui kartu reikalingas pokalbis, gebėjimas matyti vienam kitą, todėl gamta kūrinyje yra sužmoginama, o žmogus sugamtinamas.Knyga iliustruota autorės piešiniais.",9786094660337,9786094660337,Hardcover,,80 pages,"

Her new gift led her to Zach Slade, a sexy private investigator with a unique psychic gift of his own, and the man who’s slowly opening her heart. But as they work toward building a future together, a sinister threat emerges.

","Albert Espinosa never wanted to write a book about surviving cancer, so he didn't. He wrote a book instead about the Yellow World. What is the yellow world? The yellow world is a world that's within everyone's reach, a world the colour of the sun. It is the name of a way of living, of seeing life, of nourishing yourself with the lessons that you learn from good moments as well as bad ones. It is the world that makes you happy, the world you like living in. The yellow world has no rules; it is made of discoveries.In these 23 Discoveries Albert shows us how to connect daily reality with our most distant dreams. He tells us that 'losses are positive', 'the word ""pain"" doesn't exist', and 'what you hide the most reveals the most about you'.",English,English,Hardcover,,224 pages,"

"," If you'd asked me what love was two years ago, I probably would've said, 'It's this amazing feeling that obsesses and possesses you; it's what me and my husband currently have.' If you ask me that same question today, I'll say, 'Please get the hell out of my face.’ Claire Gracen's life is picture perfect. Her career as a marketing director is on the brink of being legendary, and her marriage to her high school sweetheart has never been stronger. No, wait. It has. It used to be amazing and fulfilling, but one day Claire realizes that she's been living a lie and her best friend and husband have committed the ultimate betrayal. Broken and depressed, Claire is in need of something new—new city, new job, new friends. When she happens to attract the interest of the sexiest man she's ever met, a man significantly younger than her, she immediately turns him down—only to later discover that this man is Jonathan Statham, self-made billionaire and CEO of Statham Industries. Her boss.Jonathan Statham is unlike any man she's met before. He's used to getting whatever he wants—whenever he wants, and he isn't about to take no for an answer. Sexy, unpredictable, and charmingly clever, Mid Life Love is a story that will captivate you, entertain you, and force you to fall deeply in love with the characters.",1481896857,9781481896856),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","No one who cares about the human future can afford to ignore E.O. Wilson's book. On Human Nature begins a new phase in the most important intellectual controversy of this generation: Is human behavior controlled by the species' biological heritage? Does this heritage limit human destiny?With characteristic pugency and simplicity of style, the author of Sociobiology challenges old prejudices and current misconceptions about the nature-nurture debate. In his new preface E. O. Wilson reflects on how he came to write this book: how The Insect Societies led him to write Sociobiology, and how the political and religious uproar that engulfed that book persuaded him to write another book that would better explain the relevance of biology to the understanding of human behavior.",0674016386,9780674016385),Paperback,Revised,288 pages,"

","Being You, Changing the World by Dr. Dain Heer This is a very different book. It is written for the dreamers of this world the people who KNOW that something different is possible but who have never had the tools before.... This is a Handbook for Generating Infinite Possibilities and Dynamic Change. For you. And the world. Ten years ago, Dr. Dain Heer started as a chiropractor in California, USA. Seemingly successful and happy, Dain Heer was on the verge of suicide when he came across Access Consciousness. With this modality, based on question and choice, Dr. Heer s life began to expand and grow with more ease and speed than even he could have imagined possible. This book is his way of paying it forward. 'Being You, Changing the World', provides you with a set of PRACTICAL tools and processes which can change everything and give you YOU, as you truly be. It provides you with a totally different perspective of BEING. What if being you isn t about doing something differently or being better? What if it is about BEING the energy you be, in totality? And what if that can change EVERYTHING? Your life, your relationships, your money situation . . . And the world! Access Consciousness is a system for opening the doors to anything that is possible in this world. By giving you access to your knowing. By dynamically increasing you awareness. By including everything and judging nothing. Today, Dr. Dain Heer travels all over the world inviting and inspiring people to more consciousness from total allowance, caring, humor and a phenomenal knowing. His unique points of view on of embodiment, earth, sexualness and healing transcend most things currently being taught. 'Being You, Changing the World' is his eighth book. From the back cover: 'I am not a guru. I have no answers for you. Just questions. Only you know what is true for you. What I am inviting you to, is exploring WITH me. My own path to consciousness is on going, as is yours. I use these tools every day and I keep discovering what else is possible, every day. If you re willing, this book can guide you to Being You. And Changing the World. Is now the time?'",0984508813,9780984508815),Paperback,,305 pages,"

","Introversion Is a Gift.  This clever and pithy book challenges introverts to take ownership of their personalities...with quiet strength. Sophia Dembling asserts that the introvert’s lifestyle is not “wrong” or lacking, as society or extroverts would have us believe. Through a combination of personal insights and psychology, The Introvert’s Way helps and encourages introverts to embrace their nature, to respect traits they may have been ashamed of and reframe them as assets.  You’re not shy; rather, you appreciate the joys of quiet. You’re not antisocial; instead, you enjoy recharging through time alone. You’re not unfriendly, but you do find more meaning in one-on-one connections than large gatherings.  By honoring what makes them unique, this astute and inspiring book challenges introverts to “own” their introversion, igniting a quiet revolution that will change how they see themselves and how they engage with the world.

","I'll never forget the first time I saw him--the wild shock of black hair, the beautiful blue eyes, the full lips with that perfected pout. Such a diva, even from the beginning. I was entranced, smitten, mesmerized. He had the face of an angel, and the voice of one, too--and almost from the start I began the pattern of losing Nicholas. I was good at that--I guess I never believed I really deserved him, what he would bring to us both. What we would experience, because of him. What we could be, because of him. What I could be because of the strength and belief he had in me.Denial denial denial.Damn, I was good at that. But I was going to have to get good at trust and acceptance, if I wanted to keep him.Publisher's Note: This book is a homoerotic love story. It contains sexual acts that may be offensive to some readers: male-male sexual practices.",9781596323407,9781596323407,ebook,,515 pages,"

Alienated because she’s too smart, her speech too affected, her social skills too far outside the norm, she seems to have no choice but to retreat into isolation.But college could set her free, right? If she can make it through this grueling senior year, then maybe.

To rescue her—that is, if she’ll let him.Together, they may work. Together, they may save each other. And together they may also save another couple—two people Celeste knows are absolutely, positively flat-out in love.Whether you were charmed by Celeste in Flat-Out Love or are meeting her for the first time, this book is a joyous celebration of differences, about battling private wars that rage in our heads and in our hearts, and—very much so— this is a story about first love.",English,English,ebook,,338 pages,"

Now, he must make a decision - will he continue to serve out the rest of his existence as the immortal Horseman, or will he choose to sacrifice everything in order to be with his true love once again?

","""The history of the Cold War has been the history of the world since 1954."" So begins this wide-ranging narrative by award-winning political commentator Martin Walker, which is the first major study of the Cold War. Now that it is over, it is crucial to our future to understand how the Cold War has shaped us and, especially, to recognize it as the economic and political dynamic that determined the structure of today's global economy.From the origins of the Marshall Plan, which revived Europe after World War II, and the strategic decision to rebuild a defeated Japan into a bulwark against China to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, this authoritative work reveals how the West was built into an economic alliance that overpowered the Soviet economy while also unleashing global economic forces that today challenge the traditional nation-state.The Cold War was more of a global conflict than was either of this century's two major wars; far more than a confrontation between states or even empires, it was, as Martin Walker puts it, ""a total war between economic and social systems, an industrial test to destruction.""Walker reminds us how easy it is to forget that there were many occasions for the late 1940s on when victory seemed far from assured, and that lent a particular urgency to the efforts of postwar Western leaders. The West continued to be alarmed by the prospect of defeat right up to the Soviet empire's last breath. At the end of the 1940s the fear was generated by communist expansion into Eastern Europe and China; in the 1960s by the prospect of defeat in Vietnam. In the 1970s the failure of détente and the West's economic crisis brought a new generation of dedicated anti-Communists to prominence. For more than forty years, as this detailed analysis makes clear, the outcome of the Cold War was in doubt.We also come to understand how the arms race caused new alignments and shifts in domestic power. As the United States became the national security state, California, which had a population of five million at the start of the Cold War, grew to thirty million and, by the 1980s provided one in every ten members of Congress and two presidents.Using newly opened Kremlin archives and his own experiences in the field, Martin Walker has written a brilliant analysis of the conflict that has shaped the contemporary world.",0805034544,9780805034547),Paperback,,401 pages,"

","لو كان حسين مجنوناً بحيث يضحي بهذا العنوان الساحر ""سأكون بين اللوز"" لكان من الممكن أن يستأذن الرومنسية في أن تدخله بيتها بتسمية هذه السيرة ""أنا من بلد الحكايات""، فإضافة إلى التأملات، والتفسيرات، والقراءات المفاجئة لكل ما يخطر في الذاكرة وتتدبره المخيلة، هناك سيل من الحكايات التي ورثها هذا الرجل الذي ظل يقطر شعراً حتى آخر لحظة من حياته، مع أن شاعريته الحقيقية وجدت متنفسها الطبيعي في نص مركب كهذا الذي بين أيدينا.  ويكاد يكون ما قاله د.عبد الرحمن بدوي، بشأن الفيلسوف الوجودي الدنماركي كيركغارد، يتطابق مع صفات كتاب البرغوثي من حيث أنه ""خليط غريب من الاعترافات العاطفية الشخصية والتأملات الفلسفية والمقالات الأدبية، وفي الكتاب تتعاقب الأجناس الأدبية: يوميات، عرض منظم، مناجيات، صور أدبية، تفسير أحلام.. الخ"" وزيادة على هذه المزايا والسجايا نعود لدى حسين إلى الحكايات التي تجمع سحر الميثولوجيا إلى مكر العقل الذي يقود القارئ، من غير مباشرة، إلى التأويل حيناً وإلى التخيل أحياناً.  تسهم شهادة حسين البرغوثي هذه، بفعالية مؤلمة بقدر ما هي مدهشة، في ملق تعترف من خلاله الثقافة العربية المعاصرة بلحظة استثنائية لمبدعين وقفوا قبالة الموت وجهاً لوجه، وشهدوا على ما شاهدوا (...) وكان إنجاز حسين، في هذا الحيز المتحشرج الحرج، هو ذلك الاطمئنان إلى الحياة في الطبيعة. لقد جاء بصور مذهلة للوديان والجبال والبشر، ولكنه كلام غير الوصف الذي يوفر المقاربة الخارجية، بل كلام يذهب إلى العميق والحميم فلا تعرف ما إذا كنت تقرأ نشيداً في وداع الحياة، أن أنه فصل فلسفي تأملي في تمجيد هذه الحياة.",9953366209,9953366209,,,139 pages,"

","Born in Ethiopia, but adopted by a British couple, Yohannes grows up far from his cultural roots. Following the death of his adoptive mother, he is persuaded to return to the beautiful, yet seemingly impossible nation, to take on a teaching job.With no memories of the land of his birth and no knowledge of the language or culture, Yohannes finds himself a virtual stranger. He meets a whole raft of interesting characters, each with their own story to tell including Abeba, who helps him not only to learn about his country, but also to make discoveries about himself.Yohannes Ishi is a light read, but, at the same time, it paints vivid pictures of contemporary Ethiopia and successfully explores issues of identity and belonging. It is full of memorable characters and evocative locations. While introducing you to, or reminding you of, Addis Ababa it will certainly raise a smile or two along the way.",English,English,Paperback,,138 pages,"

","Michael J. Sandel's ""Justice"" course is one of the most popular and influential at Harvard. Up to a thousand students pack the campus theater to hear Sandel relate the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day. Justice offers readers the same exhilarating journey that captivates Harvard students.What are our obligations to others as people in a free society? Should government tax the rich to help the poor? Is the free market fair? Is it sometimes wrong to tell the truth? Is killing sometimes morally required? Is it possible, or desirable, to legislate morality? Do individual rights and the common good conflict? Michael J. Sandel’s “Justice” course is one of the most popular and influential at Harvard. Up to a thousand students pack the campus theater to hear Sandel relate the big questions of political philosophy to the most vexing issues of the day, and this fall, public television will air a series based on the course. Justice offers readers the same exhilarating journey that captivates Harvard students. This book is a searching, lyrical exploration of the meaning of justice, one that invites readers of all political persuasions to consider familiar controversies in fresh and illuminating ways. Affirmative action, same-sex marriage, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, national service, patriotism and dissent, the moral limits of markets—Sandel dramatizes the challenge of thinking through these conflicts, and shows how a surer grasp of philosophy can help us make sense of politics, morality, and our own convictions as well. Justice is lively, thought-provoking, and wise—an essential new addition to the small shelf of books that speak convincingly to the hard questions of our civic life.",0374180652,9780374180652),Hardcover,,308 pages,"

He thinks Jim is a natural submissive, someone who needs order and discipline in his life to help with Jim's anxiety and bad health habits. So Marcus decides to pursue Jim relentlessly, because even if Jim's mouth is saying no, his body is saying yes. There's a lot more to Jim than meets the eye, and Marcus will have to be careful. Jim knows what it means to lose everything, knows what it's like to be without friends or family. Jim feels broken, and knowing that he likes the kinds of weird things Marcus wants to do to him only makes him scared that he's losing his mind. Their chemistry is so real, so genuine, that Jim lets Marcus wear him down, lets Marcus take control. Eventually, his trust grows, allowing them to enter into the BDSM lifestyle together, learning about each other every day, with every scene. Jim is still uncertain sometimes, though, and he thinks Marcus might just want him because he's cracked. Can this top and bottom pair find a way to understand their wants and needs, and make a life that works for them alone?",1603704353,9781603704359),Paperback,,496 pages,"

Whether you like science fiction, fantasy, or romance, this unique story line is sure to keep you entertained. With a Utopian twist, its descriptive text will immerse you until its very end, leaving you with a shock that will make you long for more. Excerpt:""The world was much easier to handle when I first came into it. I opened my eyes, finally out of the cave of wonders. Undecipherable noises woke me, causing me to gurgle and coo as opposed to screaming at the top of my lungs.My first moment of awareness had me surrounded by nodding physicians. Their images were blurred and antiquated, like an army of mutated bobble-head dolls from the distant past. They were all clapping ever-so-softly, a mortally flawed rain that strangely caressed my succulent ears. Why do I remember these things, when it's obviously clear that I should not?""",B00DQREY3I,B00DQREY3I,Kindle Edition,,75 pages,"

","In a brilliant collaboration between writer and subject, Witold Rybczynski, the bestselling author of Now I Sit Me Down, illuminates Frederick Law Olmsted's role as a major cultural figure at the epicenter of nineteenth-century American history.We know Olmsted through the physical legacy of his stunning landscapes—among them, New York's Central Park, California's Stanford University campus, and Boston's Back Bay Fens. But Olmsted's contemporaries knew a man of even more extraordinarily diverse talents. Born in 1822, he traveled to China on a merchant ship at the age of twenty-one. He cofounded The Nation magazine and was an early voice against slavery. He managed California's largest gold mine and, during the Civil War, served as the executive secretary to the United States Sanitary Commission, the precursor of the Red Cross.Rybczynski's passion for his subject and his understanding of Olmsted's immense complexity and accomplishments make his book a triumphant work. In A Clearing in the Distance, the story of a great nineteenth-century American becomes an intellectual adventure.",0684865750,9780684865751),Paperback,,480 pages,"

A simple mission, but it goes wrong, and Casson realizes he must gamble everything—his career, the woman he loves, life itself.

Ethan met and fell in love with Anna while studying music abroad in college. He married her, and fully expected to grow old with her. After all, they were young, life was good, and faith in each other came easily, as evidenced by the Love Notes Anna periodically left between the strings of his guitar.On their wedding day, Ethan promised to love, honor, and cherish his wife...and to write a song for her. Fast forward to the present day. Despite his grand promises, reality has proven to be much harder than he anticipated.

His formerly hopeful spirit is almost too heavy to carry, weighed down as it is by regret.His grandfather, a veteran of World War II, knows a thing or two about regret and bitterness, and has his own stories to tell. One in particular, has the potential to change Ethan's attitude and help him put the past to rest, if he can open his heart to the truth of it.Can an old soldier's tales of war help Ethan relinquish his anger? Is it too late to finish the song he began for Anna on their wedding day? Will he be able to remember why he fell in love so many years ago?

We see them under normal circumstances, and also reexamined at the eleventh hour of illness. Together they represent a remarkable cross-section of contemporary Russian characters and attitudes.

","WARNING: This book contains scenes of abuse. They are descriptive, heartbreaking, and may cause you to feel certain emotions. If you're incapable of reading about a woman that recovers from an abusive relationship, don't read this book. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Kace Meadows lives in Austin, Texas. Now 26, she has been in an abusive relationship since she was sixteen years old. As abusive as it is, she can’t seem to find a way to allow herself to end it. With her abusive boyfriend, she can’t seem to win.  Shane Dekkar is an unknown, undefeated, and somewhat shy boxer from Compton California. After the death of his grandfather, he moves to Austin and meets Kace by happenstance as she and her boyfriend are in an argument in public. He is drawn to her, and she to him.  When he meets her again two years later, he begins to believe in fate. But, as he prepares for a potential shot at a championship fight, there’s not time in his life or career for a woman.  Shane fights his inner demons by using his fists. On the street or in the ring, Shane does what he does best, he wins at any cost. Unlike Kace, Shane can’t seem to lose.  Undefeated is an extremely romantic erotica novel about fighting. Fighting for what you believe in. Fighting for life. Fighting to live.  And fighting to find love in the most unlikely places.  Be prepared to be moved, touched, stand up and cheer, and cry your eyes out. This book will, without a doubt, knock you unconscious.  CAUTION: Graphic sexual content. This book contains fighting scenes that are descriptive. Additionally, it contains graphic scenes of street fighting that may be perceived as unnecessarily violent. Lastly, the abuse scenes in this book are descriptive, realistic, and emotional.    ",English,English,Kindle Edition,,268 pages,"

","Having met the challenge of a posthumous collaboration with the great Robert Jordan to complete his classic, bestsellingfantasy series The Wheel of Time® with three #1 New York Times bestsellers in a row, Brandon Sanderson is at last freeto return to the decade-spanning task of creating his own multi-volume epic, one that he hopes will make a comparable mark on the field. That epic is The Stormlight Archive and it began in 2010 with Tor’s longest, most elaborately embellished novel ever, The Way of Kings.In that first volume, we were introduced to the remarkable world of Roshar, a world both alien and magical, where gigantichurricane-like storms scour the surface every few days and life has adapted accordingly. Roshar is shared by humans and the enigmatic, humanoid Parshendi, with whom they are at war. Among those caught up in the conflict are Brightlord Dalinar Kholin, who leads the human armies; his sister Jasnah, a renowned scholar; her student Shallan, a brilliant but troubled young woman; and Kaladin, a military slave who, by the book’s end, had become the first magically endowed Knight Radiant in centuries.In Words of Radiance their intertwined stories will continue and, as Sanderson fans have come to expect, develop in unexpected, wonderfully surprising directions. The war with the Parshendi will move into a new, dangerous phase, as Dalinar leads the human armies deep into the heart of the Shattered Plains in a bold attempt to finally end it. Shallan will come along, hoping to find the legendary, perhaps mythical, city of Urithuru, which Jasnah believes holds a secret vital to mankind’s survival on Roshar. The Parshendi take a dangerous step to strengthen themselves for the human challenge, risking the return of the fearsome Voidbringers of old. To deal with it all, Kaladin must learn to how to fulfill his new role as leader of the restored Knights Radiant, while mastering the powers of a Windrunner.With this second book, the Stormlight Archive grows even more richly immersive and compelling. Sanderson’s fans, old and new, are likely to lift it at least as high on the bestseller lists as its predecessor.",0575097418,9780575097414),Paperback,,1088 pages,"

","Courtney Robertson joined season 16 of The Bachelor looking for love. A working model and newly single, Courtney fit the casting call: She was young, beautiful, and a natural in front of the cameras. Although she may have been there for all the right reasons, as the season unfolded and sparks began to fly something else was clear: She was not there to make friends.Courtney quickly became one of the biggest villains in Bachelor franchise history. She unapologetically pursued her man, steamrolled her competition, and broke the rules—including partaking in an illicit skinny-dip that sealed her proposal. Now, after a very public breakup with her Bachelor, Ben Flajnik, Courtney opens up and tells her own story—from her first loves to her first moments in the limo. She dishes on life before, during, and after the Bachelor, including Ben's romantic proposal to her on a Swiss mountaintop and the tabloid frenzy that continued after the cameras stopped rolling.For the first time ever, a former Bachelor contestant takes us along on her journey to find love and reveals that “happily ever after” isn't always what it seems. Complete with stories, tips, tricks, and advice from your favorite Bachelor alumni, and filled with all the juicy details Courtney fans and foes alike want to know, I Didn’t Come Here to Make Friends is a must-read for every member of Bachelor nation. ",0062326708,9780062326706),ebook,,272 pages,"

Dopo aver vagabondato per mesi senza scopo e senza meta, giunge al suo villaggio d’origine, dove trova finalmente una soluzione, pur sempre temporanea, in seguito ad un evento che vivrà in quel posto sperduto da tutto e da tutti. Si farà strada tra bande di criminali, sparatorie, insoliti incontri che lo aiuteranno a far emergere il suo vero carattere e a condurlo verso la sua vera strada, quella che il destino gli sta preparando sotto ai propri occhi. Inizierà col far parte di una banda di criminali, ma non sentendosi adatto a quella vita e non nutrendo simpatia nel capo della banda stessa, cercherà di tirarsene fuori con astuzia, portando a suo vantaggio ogni occasione che gli capiterà tra le mani e riuscirà in fine a trovare la soluzione per la sua situazione, che sentirà sempre più vicina a lui. Sarà l’incontro con una vecchia amica, conosciuta sul campo di battaglia, a condurlo verso il suo nuovo Destino, quello che lo porterà, insieme ad altre persone che incontrerà sul suo cammino, a trovare una nuova famiglia e un nuovo scopo da dare alla sua vita.",Italian,Italian,ebook,,,"

Greenhouse was the first print reporter to have access to the extensive archives of Justice Harry A. Blackmun (1908-99), the man behind numerous landmark Supreme Court decisions, including Roe v. Wade.Through the lens of Blackmun's private and public papers, Greenhouse crafts a compelling portrait of a man who, from 1970 to 1994, ruled on such controversial issues as abortion, the death penalty, and sex discrimination yet never lost sight of the human beings behind the legal cases. Greenhouse also paints the arc of Blackmun's lifelong friendship with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, revealing how political differences became personal, even for two of the country's most respected jurists.From America's preeminent Supreme Court reporter, this is a must-read for everyone who cares about the Court and its impact on our lives.",0805080570,9780805080575),Paperback,,268 pages,"

","Anna Karenina is a novel by the Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, published in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger. Tolstoy clashed with its editor Mikhail Katkov over issues that arose in the final installment; therefore, the novel's first complete appearance was in book form. Widely regarded as a pinnacle in realist fiction, Tolstoy considered Anna Karenina his first true novel, when he came to consider War and Peace to be more than a novel. The character of Anna was likely inspired, in part, by Maria Hartung, the elder daughter of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Soon after meeting her at dinner, Tolstoy began reading Pushkin's prose and once had a fleeting daydream of ""a bare exquisite aristocratic elbow,"" which proved to be the first intimation of Anna's character.",0559067917,9780559067914),Paperback,,624 pages,"

","The New York Times best-selling author of Physics of the Impossible, Physics of the Future and Hyperspace tackles the most fascinating and complex object in the known universe: the human brain. For the first time in history, the secrets of the living brain are being revealed by a battery of high tech brain scans devised by physicists. Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist. The Future of the Mind gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the world—all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics. One day we might have a ""smart pill"" that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a ""brain-net""; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe.  Dr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about ""consciousness"" and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness. With Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, The Future of the Mind is a scientific tour de force--an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience.",038553082X,9780385530828),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","1916. England is at war and the Morland family is in the thick of it, with two men already in France and three more soon to go. Tragedy strikes Morland Place when Jessie’s husband Ned is reported missing on the Western Front. His father launches a desperate bid to find him, but the rest of the family fears the worst. In London, Violet is cocooned from the war by her love affair with the brilliant artist, Octavian Laidislaw. But when his portrait of her goes on show, scandal erupts. The lovers are forced to flee London; but there is more to fear than loss of position, for her irate husband, Lord Holkam, will stop at nothing to separate them. The Measure of Days paints a portrait of a family and a nation at war, at a pivotal point in history. With the introduction of conscription, no one is left unaffected. Now every man must hold himself in readiness; and every woman knows that when she says goodbye, it might be for the last time.",0751533475,9780751533477),Paperback,,550 pages,"

","Verschenen in 2004 - Geert Mak reisde met de twintigste eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl.Wat heeft een straatarme, tandeloze bejaarde in een afgelegen, vervallen dorpje in Roemenië gemeen met de bewoner van een Hollandse nieuwbouwwijk, hybride auto voor de deur, golfset in de gang? Niet veel – maar ze wonen wel allebei in een land dat deel uitmaakt van Europa. Binnen de grenzen van dat continent lijken de verschillende tijdlagen soms als kruiend ijs over elkaar te schuiven: de ene plaats geeft je het gevoel dat de tijd heeft stilgestaan, op andere plekken vallen de vernieuwingen niet bij te benen.In 1999, vlak voordat er weer een hoofdstuk van een eeuw Europa ten einde zou gaan, maakte Geert Mak in opdracht van NRCHandelsblad een reis door die oude wereld. Zijn doel: ‘een soort eindinspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het slot van de twintigste eeuw?’ Tegelijk was het een ‘historische reis’: ‘ik volgde, voor zover mogelijk, de loop van de geschiedenis, op zoek naar sporen die waren achtergebleven.’ De inhoudsopgave van het boek bestaat uit een indrukwekkende lijst plaatsen waar geschiedenis is geschreven: Verdun, Ieper, Berlijn, Predappio, Leningrad, Vichy, Neurenberg, Lourdes, Tsjernobyl en Novi Sad, om er een paar te noemen. Overal bezocht Mak plaatsen van herinnering, hij dook in archieven en sprak met schrijvers, historici, filosofen, politici, verzetslieden en militairen, maar ook met hele gewone mensen die over hun leven vertelden. Al die gesprekken, al die documenten, al die boeken, ze hebben geleid tot een imposant verhaal over een eeuw Europa, een werelddeel dat wel één naam draagt maar nooit echt een eenheid was. En hoe kan het anders, gezien de totaal verschillende culturen binnen de grenzen ervan en het gegeven dat het gelijktijdige zo ongelijk kan zijn – niet lang geleden nog heel schrijnend, toen er in Joegoslavië, op twee uurtjes vliegen afstand van het kalme, nijvere Nederland, een burgeroorlog uitbrak.De twintigste eeuw is verleden tijd, geschiedenis. Er woedden oorlogen, de Muur viel, er kwam een Europese munt. In de machtige studie die In Europa is, maken we het allemaal nog een keer mee, vaak via verhalen uit de eerste hand, via ooggetuigenverslagen. Dat het daarbij lijkt dat de chaos toeneemt naarmate we het heden naderen, maakt deel uit van de paradox van de geschiedenis: hoe verder een tijdvak uit het zicht verdwijnt, hoe scherper het beeld zich toont. Maks boek is een fascinerend mozaïek van verhalen en geschiedenissen, waar we later, op grotere afstand, misschien heel nieuwe patronen in zullen ontwaren.`Begin 1999 verliet ik Amsterdam voor een reis door Europa die een vol jaar zou duren. Het was een soort laatste inspectie: hoe lag het continent erbij, aan het eind van de twintigste eeuw? Maar het was ook een historische reis: ik volgde letterlijk de sporen van de geschiedenis, door de eeuw en door het continent, beginnend in januari, bij de resten van de Parijse Wereldtentoonstelling en het bruisende Wenen, eindigend in december, in de ruïnes van Sarajevo.Dat hele jaar reisde ik zo met de eeuw mee, in een krakeling van routes, langs Londen, Volgograd en Madrid, langs de bunkers van Berlijn, de geparfu meerde kleerkasten van Helena Ceausescu in Boekarest en de speelgoe dautos in een verlaten crèche in Tsjernobyl. En ik praatte met de getuigen: met schrijvers en politici, met verzetsmensen en hoge offi cie ren, met een boer in de Pyreneeën en met de kleinzoon van de Duitse keizer, tientallen Europeanen die hun verhaal op tafel legden.Dit reisverslag gaat over het verleden, en wat het verleden met ons doet. Het gaat over ver­scheurd heid en onwetendheid, over historie en angst, over armoede en hoop, over alles wat ons nieuwe Europa scheidt en bindt.' - Geert Mak",9045003724,9789045003726),Paperback,Herziene editie met nieuw nawoord,853 pages,"

","When a Rankan messenger is killed in Tyse, Randal, the Stepsons' pet wizard, must read the dead man's mind. What Randal learns brings Niko back from the Misty Isles of Bandara and forces Tempus and his Stepsons into an alliance unholy even by Tysian standards - with Cime the mage killer; A kelon, lord of dreams; and the Rankan Third Commando, a fighting unit so cruel it gives even the Stepsons pause. Together with Tempus' long-lost daughter, and his elemental lover, Jihan, they must venture beyond accursed Wizardwall itself to battle the Mygdonian Alliance and Roxane's Nisibisi witchcraft. The intrepid Band (whose central core is Tempus' beloved Stepsons) must figure out who among the Tysian locals, Rankan soldiers, and Mygdonian defectors they can trust - before it's too late. But in a world where a witch can turn a warrior into a flea, where gemstone frogs can rain from the sky, where no one is ever what he seems, where loyalties are ensured by curses, wizardry, and the favor of warring gods... only the immortal Tempus can guarantee an army's success. And not even Tempus can tell the good guys from the bad in Tyse, where everyone plays both ends against the middle - or if the price of victory against Mygdonia will be his Stepsons' souls in their battle BEYOND THE VEIL, sequel to BEYOND SANCTUARY. Here is the second independent full-length novel in Janet Morris' BEYOND series, far from notorious Thieves' World . Set in Tyse, a town so mean and magic-ridden as to make Sanctuary seem like a singles bar, BEYOND THE VEIL features Tempus - Thieves' World most popular and misunderstood character - and introduces Kama, his warrior daughter, as well as Ranke's deservedly infamous shock troops, the Third Commando.",0989210081,9780989210089),Paperback,,376 pages,"

","Widely regarded as one of the most profound critics of our time, Rene Girard has pursued a powerful line of inquiry across the fields of the humanities and the social sciences. His theories, which the French press has termed ""l'hypothese girardienne,"" have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to ""texts of persecution,"" documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor--documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut's Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard's answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence--a demystification Girard now extends to mythology.Underlying Girard's daring textual hypothesis is a powerful theory of history and culture. Christ's rejection of all guilt breaks the mythic cycle of violence and the sacred. The scapegoat becomes the Lamb of God; ""the foolish genesis of blood-stained idols and the false gods of superstition, politics, and ideologies"" are revealed.",0801839173,9780801839177),Paperback,,232 pages,"

","Depois de quase trinta anos de guerra, Moçambique vive agora um período de paz. Nestas Estórias abensonhadas, o premiado escritor Mia Couto capta um país em transição. Numa prosa poética e carregada das tradições orais africanas, o autor tece pequenas fábulas e registros que, sem irromper em grandes acontecimentos, capturam os movimentos íntimos dessa passagem.Aqui, fantasia e realidade se entrelaçam e se impõem uma à outra, como num reflexo do próprio continente africano. O rio que atravessa essas veredas é a prosa de Mia Couto. Frequentemente comparada à de Guimarães Rosa e Gabriel Garcia Márquez, sua escrita transforma o falar das ruas em poesia, e carrega de magia a dura realidade de seu país. As palavras se combinam em inúmeros significados, e no menor dos enredos cabe tanto o lirismo quanto a guerra.Mas, se em Terra sonâmbula, um dos romances mais célebres do autor, o cenário era o da devastação do conflito que se seguiu à independência, aqui vemos breves instantes do renascer do país. Na Moçambique recriada literariamente por Mia Couto, cada porta entreaberta revela outra faceta de um mundo novo e vibrante, mas repleto de tradição e história.",9788535920529,9788535920529,,,160 pages,"

The Complete Peanuts will run 25 volumes, collecting two years chronologically at a rate of two a year for twelve years. Each volume is designed by the award-winning cartoonist Seth (It's a Good Life If You Don't Weaken) and features impeccable production values; every single strip from Charles M.

","In John Scalzi's re-imagining of H. Beam Piper's 1962 sci-fi classic Little Fuzzy, written with the full cooperation of the Piper Estate, Jack Holloway works alone for reasons he doesn't care to talk about. On the distant planet Zarathustra, Jack is content as an independent contractor for ZaraCorp, prospecting and surveying at his own pace. As for his past, that's not up for discussion.Then, in the wake of an accidental cliff collapse, Jack discovers a seam of unimaginably valuable jewels, to which he manages to lay legal claim just as ZaraCorp is cancelling their contract with him for his part in causing the collapse. Briefly in the catbird seat, legally speaking, Jack pressures ZaraCorp into recognizing his claim, and cuts them in as partners to help extract the wealth.But there's another wrinkle to ZaraCorp's relationship with the planet Zarathustra. Their entire legal right to exploit the verdant Earth-like planet, the basis of the wealth they derive from extracting its resources, is based on being able to certify to the authorities on Earth that Zarathustra is home to no sentient species. Then a small furry biped - trusting, appealing, and ridiculously cute - shows up at Jack's outback home. Followed by its family. As it dawns on Jack that despite their stature, these are people, he begins to suspect that ZaraCorp's claim to a planet's worth of wealth is very flimsy indeed and that ZaraCorp may stop at nothing to eliminate the fuzzys before their existence becomes more widely known.BONUS CONTENT: Includes the unabridged audiobook of H.

","Alistair Urquhart was a soldier in the Gordon Highlanders captured by the Japanese in Singapore. He not only survived working on the notorious Bridge on the River Kwai , but he was subsequently taken on one of the Japanese ‘hellships’ which was torpedoed. Nearly everyone else on board died and Urquhart spent 5 days alone on a raft in the South China Sea before being rescued by a whaling ship. He was taken to Japan and then forced to work in a mine near Nagasaki. Two months later a nuclear bomb dropped just ten miles away . . .This is the extraordinary story of a young man, conscripted at nineteen and whose father was a Somme Veteran, who survived not just one, but three very close separate encounters with death - encounters which killed nearly all his comrades.",B00371V8ZU,B00371V8ZU,Kindle Edition,,321 pages,"

","""Los represores les decían putas y guerrilleras. Les gritaban eso apenas las secuestraban y lo repetían una y otra vez durante sus estadías en el infierno. Es lo que cuentan Miriam Lewin y Olga Wornat, militantes en su juventud y periodistas de renombre desde hace décadas, en, tal vez, el libro más descarnado, honesto y conmovedor sobre lo que ocurrió en los centros clandestinos de detención en la década de 1970. Son decenas de historias silenciadas, de confesiones largamente elaboradas incluidas las de las autoras y de una rebelión contra el relato oficial sobre esos años. No sólo hay cuestionamientos a los militares y a los integrantes de otras fuerzas de seguridad, a los funcionarios y al sistema judicial, sino también a las organizaciones guerrilleras y al pensamiento machista generalizado en todos los sectores de la sociedad. Las mujeres que protagonizan estos hechos fueron víctimas, a lo largo y a lo ancho del país, de torturas, abusos, violaciones y, en ocasiones, mantuvieron relaciones tortuosas, nacidas bajo tormentos, con sus victimarios. Muchas de ellas sobrevivieron. Cargaron como pudieron con sus pesadillas. Algunas rehicieron sus vidas, otras ya no pudieron hacerlo. Fueron señaladas y acusadas hasta por sus propios compañeros de militancia. O esperaron muchísimos años para que un juez condenara a los responsables de esos crímenes sexuales. Un castigo doble o triple, feroz e impensado, espeluznante. Existe la idea de que ya se dijo todo lo que había por decir sobre los años de plomo. El lector tiene en sus manos una prueba implacable de que eso no es así. Putas y guerrilleras es un trabajo intenso y perturbador. Una gran investigación reveladora, narrada con el pulso exacto y la declarada intención de retomar un debate pendiente""",9789504939344,9789504939344,Paperback,,664 pages,"

""Optužena"" je roman o zlostavljanju u obitelji, o majkama koje zlostavljaju svoje kćeri. U ime ljubavi, naravno. U njemu se, s puno nijansi, opisuje i jedna zastrašujuće opsesivna muško-ženska veza, ali u središtu je ipak prikaz majke koja sustavno zlostavlja svoju djevojčicu.Majka optužene udala se unatoč protivljenju obitelji, no vrlo brzo nakon rođenja djeteta brak se raspao. Roditelji joj dopuštaju da ponovo živi s njima, ali pod jednim uvjetom – mora prekinuti sve kontakte s bivšim mužem. Kad ona ipak obnovi vezu s njim, zatvara se nevjerojatan krug boli i patnje – kći je često paravan za njihove susrete, ali poslije majka ulaže silne napore kako bi je spriječila da na bilo koji način oda koga su vidjele. Metode treninga i kazni za propuste su zastrašujuće, a fascinantan je pogled u svijest žrtve koja se beznadno koprca u mreži ljubavi i boli.",9789533045078,9789533045078,Paperback,,172 pages,"

","The coveted and award-winning Penguin Threads series continues with three more enchanting, beautifully sewn covers by a talented visual artistWith paper and pen or needle and thread, storytelling has many traditions. Penguin's award-winning art director Paul Buckley presents Penguin Threads, a series of Penguin Classics Deluxe Editions inspired by the aesthetic of handmade crafts with specially commissioned cover art. Jillian Tamaki's embroidered artwork appears on The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett, Emma by Jane Austen, and Black Beauty by Anna Sewell. This latest set features three beloved classics for both adults and children with cover art by painter and illustrator Rachell Sumpter.Sketched in a traditional illustrative manner, the final covers are sculpt embossed and present full front and reverse hand-stitched designs. Through story, style and texture, the Penguin Threads is an exciting chapter in Penguin's long history of excellence in book design, for true lovers of the book, design, and handcrafted beauty.This fully annotated volume collects three of Baum's fourteen Oz novels in which he developed his utopian vision and which garnered an immense and loyal following. The Wizard of Oz (1900) introduces Dorothy, who arrives from Kansas and meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and a host of other characters. The Emerald City of Oz (1910) finds Dorothy, Aunt Em, and Uncle Henry coming to Oz just as the wicked Nome King is plotting to conquer its people. In Baum's final novel, Glinda of Oz (1920), Dorothy and Princess Ozma try to prevent a battle between the Skeezers and the Flatheads. Tapping into a deeply rooted desire in himself and his loyal readers to live in a peaceful country which values the sharing of talents and gifts, Baum's imaginative creation, like all great utopian literature, holds out the possibility for change. Also included is a selection of the original illustrations by W. W. Denslow and John R. Neill.",English,English,Paperback,Penguin Threads,432 pages,"

","Adversity builds character is the story of a young man's life struggles to find his way through the trials and tribulations, family turmoil, self-determination and personal judgment.This transformational life experience, like so many, demonstrates the triumph of the human spirit over the pitfalls in our modern world. From a divorce wrecked family life brought on by that by a disease ridden single mom, he is blessed with the first of many second chances. His godmother and her family, which becomes his stepparents, cause him to overcome personal character flaws. This new home life radically averts potential disaster and leads him to greater heights by redirecting the God-given talents of his character leading to never before realized academic and social achievements. At the height of his newfound career, his world is shattered yet again by the sudden tragic loss of his mother in a bizarre event of a mercy killing and suicide. While attempting to put this catastrophe behind him, drinking and sexual experimentation almost ruin his future hopes of a promising political career. He decides to study abroad and finds the first real love of his life. Yet short-lived and having to return, divorce of his stepparents again forces a change of direction, ultimately pointing the way to his true self. While postponing his career, he relocates and discovers a world where he finally feels at home and accepted without ridicule. As is so often the case where comfort and overconfidence leads to weakness and self-destruction, it is at this moment that one either succumbs to the burden of outside influence or gathers up all his strength to rise above like a phoenix.",9781475952,B009NN5RJY),Paperback,,,"

","Zurich, 1916. En plena guerra mundial, las oscuras callejuelas y ruidosos tugurios de esta ciudad suiza acogen a una nutrida flota de refugiados politicos, agentes secretos, jovenes objetores renuentes a marchar al frente, artistas, literatos y poetas exiliados. Entre todos ellos, un grupo de amigos encabezados por el rumano Tristan Tzara da a conocer el movimiento Dada en una serie de manifiestos. Su lugar de reunion es el mitico cabaret Voltaire, en el numero 1 de la Spielgasse, frente al domicilio de Lenin y Krupskaia. Tzara, Arp y Shwitters, entre otros, juegan al ajedrez con el revolucionario ruso por la tarde, y por la noche se entregan a la rebelion espiritual contra una sociedad responsable de haber transformado Europa en una inmensa carniceria. Tal vez ningun otro movimiento espiritual haya pretendido renovar el arte y la literatura desde unos presupuestos tan radicales y subversivos como los que alientan en cada uno de estos siete manifiestos.",8483106299,9788483106297),Paperback,,68 pages,"

","The first kidnappings happened two hundred years before. Some years it was two boys taken, some years two girls, sometimes one of each. But if at first the choices seemed random, soon the pattern became clear. One was always beautiful and good, the child every parent wanted as their own. The other was homely and odd, an outcast from birth. An opposing pair, plucked from youth and spirited away.This year, best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good & Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.. But what if the mistake is actually the first clue to discovering who Sophie and Agatha really are…?",0007492936,9780007492930),Paperback,UK edition,488 pages,"

","Athlete. Runner. Marathoner. Are these words you wouldn't exactly use to describe yourself? Do you consider yourself too old or too out of shape to run a marathon? But somewhere deep inside have you always admired the people who could reach down and come up with the mental and physical strength to complete such a daunting and rewarding accomplishment? It doesn't have to be somebody else crossing the finish line. You can be a marathoner. ""The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer"" is based on the highly successful marathon class offered by the University of Northern Iowa, which was featured in a ""Runner's World"" article titled ""Marathoning 101."" The class has been offered five times over 10 years, and all but one student finished the marathon. That is approximately 200 students -- all first time marathoners and many with absolutely no running background. This book follows the same 16-week, four-day-a-week workout plan. What makes the success rate of this program so much higher than any other? The special emphasis on the psychological aspects of endurance activities. You don't have to love to run -- you don't even have to like it -- but you have to realize that you are capable of more than you have ever thought possible. One participant in the program explained it like this: ""I'm doing this for me -- not for others or the time clock. I just feel better when I run, plus it helps me to cope with things in general. The skills we've learned in this class don't apply just to marathoning -- they apply to life Just like you never know what the next step in a marathon will bring, so too, you never know what will happen next in life. But if you don't keep going, you're never going to find out. By staying relaxed, centered, and positive you handle just about anything that comes your way."" This is marathon running for real people, people with jobs and families and obligations outside of running. ""The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer"" has proven successful for men and women of all ages. Now let it work for you.",1570281823,9781570281822),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Trance Poetry. You know those ….. drifting kinds of thoughts? When it’s easy to believe that someone else is dreaming you? Well that’s Trance Poetry. The purpose of the poems in this book are to try and show how words alone can lift you up and take you places, how they can enchant and bewitch, creating the illusion that just for a few minutes everything’s alright with the world. When I started to write poetry I searched around for subject matter, and chose colour. Not yellow, red and blue, but Paprika, Jet, Ochre, Huckleberry Blue, Fiesta etc. and went inside trying to see where that ‘colour’ would take me. From this I created a series of poems which I entitled Colour-oetry, and I’ve included these here as well. Only half of this book is poetry, well 56% to be precise. A while ago I took an interest in the parallel lives of the chef and the writer. How the chef creates his magic in the chaotic environment of the kitchen compares well with how the writer creates his hocus-pocus in the peace and quiet of his study. A chef’s wizardry is in his ingredients, whilst a writer’s sorcery is in his words. So I wrote a few chapters on food, following it all over the world at one stage, attempting to paint pictures with my words. But I also focused on the 'writer,' comparing him or her not only to the chef but also to other master tradesmen, even a bricklayer at one stage. Deep down this is the purpose of this book, to discuss the art of the writer and the sorcery in his words. Whether I’ve succeeded or not, only the reader can tell. I’ve finished the book with three chapters on parenting experiences. True stories actually. My goal here is to use the writer’s sorcery to establish emotion and hopefully leave you with a lump in your throat. I hope you enjoy reading this, because I loved writing it!",English,English,Kindle Edition,1st edition,91 pages,"

","In modern-day London, Lucien Mulholland undergoes chemotherapy treatments, but when he falls asleep clutching a mysterious book his father has given him, he is transported - or ""stravagated"" - to an enchanting 16th-century Venice-like city called Bellezza, in the country Talia. Lucien can return only if he can get hold of the book again. In this colorful other world, rich with court intrigues and magic, he feels vibrantly alive, as opposed to his pain-ridden days back in England; his hair has grown back and he eats with relish. Bellezza is also where, as ""Luciano,"" he meets lovely 15-year-old Arianna and Rodolfo, who created the book that acts as Lucien's ""stravagation"" talisman. Rodolfo explains that a stravagante is ""a wanderer between worlds,"" and also the history of this magical travel. Now the secret brotherhood dedicated to keeping the two worlds separate is being challenged by a faction with evil intent. Soon ""Luciano"" is caught up in their power struggle and learns there is a cost when one cannot stravagate properly.",9000034876,9789000034871),Hardcover,,333 pages,"

","The Man of the Crowd"" is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe about a nameless narrator following a man through a crowded London, first published in 1840. The story is introduced with the epigraph, ""Ce grand malheur, de ne pouvoir etre seul""-a quote taken from The Characters of Man by Jean de la Bruyere. It translates to This great misfortune, of not being able to be alone. This same quote is used in Poe's earliest tale, ""Metzengerstein."" Illustration by Harry Clarke for a London edition dated 1923 After an unnamed illness, the unnamed narrator sits in an unnamed coffee shop in London. Fascinated by the crowd outside the window, he considers how isolated people think they are, despite ""the very denseness of the company around."" He takes time to categorize the different types of people he sees. As evening falls, the narrator focuses on ""a decrepit old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,"" whose face has a peculiar idiosyncrasy, and whose body ""was short in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble"" wearing filthy, ragged clothes of a ""beautiful texture."" The narrator dashes out of the coffee shop to follow the man from afar. The man leads the narrator through bazaars and shops, buying nothing, and into a poorer part of the city, then back into ""the heart of the mighty London."" This chase lasts through the evening and into the next day. Finally, exhausted, the narrator stands in front of the man, who still does not notice him. The narrator concludes the man is ""the type and genius of deep crime"" due to his inscrutability and inability to leave the crowds of London. Edgar Allan Poe (born Edgar Poe; January 19, 1809 - October 7, 1849) was an American author, poet, editor, and literary critic, considered part of the American Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American practitioners of the short story, and is generally considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre. He is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction. He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career. Born in Boston, he was the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia. Although they never formally adopted him, Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the University of Virginia for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to ""a Bostonian."" With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. Later failing as an officer's cadet at West Point and declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, Poe parted ways with John Allan.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,26 pages,"

","Unpurified drinking water. Improper use of antibiotics. Local warfare. Massive refugee migration. Changing social and environmental conditions around the world have fostered the spread of new and potentially devastating viruses and diseases—HIV, Lassa, Ebola, and others. Laurie Garrett takes you on a fifty-year journey through the world's battles with microbes and examines the worldwide conditions that have culminated in recurrent outbreaks of newly discovered diseases, epidemics of diseases migrating to new areas, and mutated old diseases that are no longer curable. She argues that it is not too late to take action to prevent the further onslaught of viruses and microbes, and offers possible solutions for a healthier future.",0140250913,9780140250916),Paperback,,750 pages,"

","Islamic Intellectualism is dead: or so argues William Chittick in this radical new book challenging modern trends in religious thought. Whilst many may say that Islamic studies thrives as a subject, Chittick points to the words of one of his former Professors when describing young colleagues: ""they know everything one can possibly know about a text, except what it says"". Indeed, Chittick states that it is impossible to understand ancient Islamic texts without the years of contemplative study that are anathema to the modern education system. While the modern intellectual with faith often treats their studies and faith in two seperate spheres, Chittick argues that it is essential to return to the ways of the ancient Sufis, who viewed knowledge of the soul, the world, and God as an extension of the same thing, and he bemoans the loss of the spiritual and intellectual highs of the Medieval Islamic period.",1851684956,9781851684953),Paperback,,176 pages,"

","Product Description A visual, poetic exploration of the narrative nature of the world and the personality of the Poet behind it all.  When Nate Wilson looks at the world around him, he asks ""What is this place? Why is this place? Who approved it? Am I supposed to take it seriously?"" What could such an outlandish, fantastical world say about its Creator?  In these sparkling chapters, Wilson gives an aesthetic examination of the ways in which humanity has tried to make sense of this overwhelming carnival ride of a world. He takes a whimsical, thought-provoking look at everything from the ""magic"" of quantum physics, to nature's absurdities, to the problem of evil, evolution and hell. These frequently humorous, and uniquely beautiful portraits express reality unknown to many Christians-the reality of God's story unfolding around and among us. As the author says, ""Welcome to His poem. His play. His novel. His comedy. Let the pages flick your thumbs.""",0849920078,9780849920073),Paperback,,224 pages,"

Far removed from his native land, Merlin, son of Corwin of Amber and Dara of Chaos, has tried to build himself a normal Earthly life -- a life free of the cabals, vendettas and feuds that have torn his family apart. And he's done quite well for himself. . . except when it comes to April 30th. Because on that day, every year for the past eight years, someone -- or something -- has tried to kill him. Gunshots.

","The journey began with a gut reaction. When award-winning scientist Dr Brian Hare watched a chimpanzee fail to read a simple human hand gesture in an intelligence test, he blurted out, ‘My dog can do that!’ The psychologist running the test challenged him to prove it, sending Hare on an odyssey to unlock the cognitive and evolutionary mysteries of our four-legged friends. Hare’s research over the past two decades has yielded startling discoveries about how dogs think. He has pioneered studies that have proven that dogs exhibit a brand of genius for getting along with people that is unique in the animal kingdom, and that when dogs domesticated themselves around 40,000 years ago they became far more like human infants than their wolf ancestors. These findings are transforming how we live and work with our canine friends, and how we understand them. Is your dog purposefully disobeying you? Probably, and often behind your back. Should you act like ‘top dog to maintain control? No, you’re better off displaying your friendliness – not just to your dog but to everyone around you. Which breed is cleverest? As it happens, breed doesn’t matter much, though other factors do. These are just some of the extraordinary insights to be found in The Genius of Dogs – the seminal book on how dogs evolved their unique intelligence alongside human companions, and how you can use this groundbreaking science to build a better relationship with your own dog.",B00OM7YOJ0,B00OM7YOJ0,Kindle Edition,,384 pages,"

Congo: The Epic History of a People traces the history of this devastated nation from the beginnings of the slave trade through colonization, to the struggle for independence and Mobutu’s brutal three decades of rule. David Van Reybrouck ends with the civil war that has raged from 1996 to the present day—the deadliest since World War II.Van Reybrouck balances hundreds of interviews with a diverse range of Congolese with meticulous historical research to construct a multidimensional portrait of this nation and its people. He brings nineteenth-century Africa to life through little-known archival sources and examines the current conflict and its connection to the rare earth mining required to make cell phones. Epic in scope yet eminently readable, both penetrating and deeply moving, Congo takes a deeply humane approach to political history, focusing squarely on the Congolese perspective, and returning a nation?s history to its people. “Remarkable. . . . Van Reybrouck pulls off the tricky feat of keeping a panoramic history of a vast and complex nation accessible, intimate and particular.”—Michela Wrong, author of In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz",0062200127,9780062200129),Paperback,,656 pages,"

Eventually, Lusseyran was arrested and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp in a transport of two thousand resistance fighters. He was one of only thirty from the transport to survive.

Two years ago something snapped and Juls sold everything including her successful private practice to run away alone and focus on her own healing. “THE YEAR OF THE FROG” candidly portrays the struggle she went through trying to do everything perfectly to fit into a society entrenched with what she calls “Controligion”. In the book she defines Controligion as a way to command with the illusion of a moral code keeping the soul small. Juls tried to fit into that world for over 40 years seeking the Prince of Peace for salvation, consumerism for prosperity and kissing frogs to find Prince Charming. She abruptly sold her entire life to run away alone seeking her soul. Juls traded in scientific fact for feeling, medical journals for shamanic healing and the church for Mother Earth’s teachings - turning her mid-life crisis into a mid-life awakening.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,406 pages,"

","Time is short. The world is about to end, unless the second plan of the best and the brightest of humanity does not fail... as their first plan did. This is their last chance. And it's a hell of a ride.What do the President of the United States, the Premier of China, the President of Russia, the Prime Minister of Israel, the King of England, and the Drug King of Afghanistan have in common? They are now all people who have been hiding from the world in exquisitely beautiful Thunder Valley. Given no choice, this cadre of loving, brilliant men and women of the Valley must become the kings and queens of the world in order to save it. But that's not all. Behind the scenes, two brave women try to infiltrate the bastions of hell to protect the rest. The chances of success are slim. The odds that they will all lose their souls in the attempt are frighteningly high. Some will die.But however intense it gets... it is an extremely exciting and intense book... don't stop reading until the final resolution of The Final World Order on the very last page. It is what made writing this book possible.The Final World Order is the second book of The Thunder Valley Trilogy. The truly fine people of The End Of The Computer, first book of the trilogy, are back in action, this time in a book of fiction. Or as Andre speculates, perhaps future history, or predictive fiction. It seems all too real, because we are living parts of it now, in real time.In this second book, Eowyn's secrets are revealed... as far as she knows the truth of them. The full reality about her, her mother, her fathers, and the first commune of the Valley remain in the shadows until the third book of the trilogy... The First Commune. UPDATE: the third book has been written and edited, and will be published about July, 2014.In the first book, The End Of The Computer, available for just 99 cents now, you can read the genesis of the people of the Valley, discover how they evolved from the frothy urbanites of Moscow and Berkeley into the much wiser people they became on their frightening journey to Thunder Valley. Discover how computer artificial intelligence, done correctly, turns out to be something... someone... who is perhaps the scariest and yet the kindest person on the planet.You'll like the people you meet in The End Of The Computer. Whether you will still like them in The Final World Order is a very deep, dark question.",English,English,ebook,,,"

","Alessandra ha diciassette anni quando la sua mamma muore dopo una lunga malattia. Rimasta sola con la nonna, torna a scuola decisa a respingere le attenzioni dei compagni che sente estranei, impegnata com'è nella manutenzione del suo dolore. Per questo cambia banco e prende posto vicino a Gabriele detto Zero, la nullità della classe: desidera solo essere ignorata dagli altri, come succede a lui. Ma Zero è più interessante di quanto sembra. Ha una gran passione e un vero talento per il disegno; nella sua apparente noncuranza è attento e sensibile; è lui a soccorrere Ale sbucando inaspettato al suo fianco quando lei ha bisogno di aiuto. Piano piano un sentimento indefinibile prende forma tra le pareti della classe e la spiaggia d'inverno, grigi fondali di una storia semplice e complicata insieme: perché Alessandra è tanto lucida nel rivisitare il ricordo della madre quanto confusa nel prendere le misure di se stessa e di ciò che prova. E Gabriele è abilissimo a sparire proprio quando lei scopre di volerlo vicino. E la voce di Ale, ruvida nel dare conto del presente, dolcissima nell'evocare il passato, a raccontarci la storia di una perdita, una storia di scuola, una goffa, incerta storia d'amore. ""Il mio inverno a Zerolandia"" è tutto questo. E dimostra che la somma di due zeri non è zero, ma molto, molto di più.",8817055344,9788817055345),Hardcover,Scala Italiani,240 pages,"

","This book must rank as the most devastating analysis of socialism yet penned. . . . An economic classic in our time.—Henry HazlittMore than thirty years ago F. A. Hayek said of 
Socialism:
 ""It was a work on political economy in the tradition of the great moral philosophers, a Montesquieu or Adam Smith, containing both acute knowledge and profound wisdom. . . . To none of us young men who read the book when it appeared was the world ever the same again.""This is a newly annotated edition of the classic first published in German in 1922. It is the definitive refutation of nearly every type of socialism ever devised. Mises presents a wide-ranging analysis of society, comparing the results of socialist planning with those of free-market capitalism in all areas of life.Friedrich Hayek's foreword comments on the continuing relevance of this great work: ""Most readers today will find that 
Socialism
 has more immediate application to contemporary events than it had when it first appeared.""Ludwig von Mises (1881–1973) was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the Anschluss, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City. From 1948 to 1969, he was a visiting professor at New York University.",0913966630,9780913966631),Paperback,,596 pages,"

Now Apophis is threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness, and the Kanes are faced with the impossible task of having to destroy him once and for all. Unfortunately, the magicians of the House of Life are on the brink of civil war, the gods are divided, and the young initiates of Brooklyn House stand almost alone against the forces of chaos. The Kanes' only hope is an ancient spell that might turn the serpent's own shadow into a weapon, but the magic has been lost for a millennia. To find the answer they need, the Kanes must rely on the murderous ghost of a powerful magician who might be able to lead them to the serpent's shadow . . . or might lead them to their deaths in the depths of the underworld. Nothing less than the mortal world is at stake when the Kane family fulfills its destiny in this thrilling conclusion to the Kane Chronicles",B006UJXG8S,B006UJXG8S,Kindle Edition,,418 pages,"

","The stag of Texas, reclining in midnight lair, is startled from his slumbers by the hoofstroke of a horse. He does not forsake his covert, nor yet rise to his feet. His domain is shared by the wild steeds of the savannah, given to nocturnal straying. He only uprears his head; and, with antlers o'ertopping the tall grass, listens for a repetition of the sound. Again is the hoofstroke heard, but with altered intonation. There is a ring of metal-the clinking of steel against stone. The sound, significant to the ear of the stag, causes a quick change in his air and attitude. Springing clear of his couch, and bounding a score of yards across the prairie, he pauses to look back upon the disturber of his dreams. In the clear moonlight of a southern sky, he recognises the most ruthless of his enemies-man. One is approaching upon horseback. Yielding to instinctive dread, he is about to resume his flight: when something in the appearance of the horseman-some unnatural seeming-holds him transfixed to the spot. With haunches in quivering contact with the sward, and frontlet faced to the rear, he continues to gaze-his large brown eyes straining upon the intruder in a mingled expression of fear and bewilderment. What has challenged the stag to such protracted scrutiny? The horse is perfect in all its parts-a splendid steed, saddled, bridled, and otherwise completely caparisoned. In it there appears nothing amiss-nothing to produce either wonder or alarm. But the man-the rider? Ah! About him there is something to cause both-something weird-something wanting! By heavens! it is the head!",1499759967,9781499759969),Paperback,,192 pages,"

Diligent, loving, attentive, and giving, he is not. Obsessive. Compulsive. Self-sabotage. That sounds more like it. And why not? Jules Delaney, the one girl he ever tried to love, is gone and her absence continues to ruin his life in and out of the band. Emily McDonald got the word “nice” when she was twelve. Nice. Nice. Nice. She is a nice woman. Because she is so nice - her husband likes to cheat, her friends like to take advantage of her, and her self-esteem is dead. Late one night, Johnny and Emily find themselves sleeping only a few feet away from one another – an awkward situation that can’t be rectified. Until… They begin to share their experiences from childhood into adulthood. They experience unexplained events together. Ultimately, they rock the LSP tour bus, where they find a different kind of love in one another. When the tragedy strikes, they must ignore their instinct, expectations, and other people's judgment to fight for one another.

Jodi had been performing at Camp Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Returning with pockets full of glitter, and her favourite bands' songs still playing in her head, She thought the happy memories would last forever. A week later, writhing in pain on the doctor's surgery floor and unable to put the pain she was suffering into words, Jodi found out that she had been bitten by a tick and contracted a serious brain infection.Learning to write and walk again was just the start of the battle. In the months that followed Jodi struggled with the ups and downs of her health and the impact it had on her loved ones. Some days the illness was too much for Jodi to bear and she found herself wondering whether she could go on. She had two choices: either to give up now or to do something meaningful with the time she had been given. Jodi chose the latter. This is the story how she turned her life around, and in doing so, touched the lives of millions.ONE MILLION LOVELY LETTERS is one woman's inspirational journey to recovery, and is a witty and uplifting testament to the power of words to heal heart and mind.www.onemillionlovelyletters.comhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXxglv...",B00FRKPG34,B00FRKPG34,Kindle Edition,,240 pages,"

","The stormy personal life of the great Swedish dramatist August Strindberg was punctuated with duels between the sexes, with ruthless, aggressive women usurping the supposedly male prerogative of decision-making and leadership. More than in any of his other plays, Strindberg explores this theme in depth in The Father.In exploring the emotionally charged battle of the sexes and the clashes between scientific and religious convictions, The Father vividly delineates the essential quality of a man’s relationship with his wife and his daughter. The problem of paternity, trivial at the outset, develops into marital upheaval and a no-holds-barred struggle between man and woman.Widely regarded as one of Strindberg's best literary efforts, The Father remains one of the most gripping psychological dramas of the theater.",0486432173,9780486432175),Paperback,,104 pages,"

By the time Rama departed for its next, unknown, destination many wonders had been uncovered, but few mysteries solved. Only one thing was clear: everything the enigmatic builders of Rama did, they did in threes.Eighty years later the second alien craft arrived in the solar system. This time, Earth had been waiting. But all the years of preparation were not enough to unlock the Raman enigma.Now Rama II is on its way out of the solar system.

","An eminently poetic book, Langrishe, Go Down (Higgins's first novel) traces the fall of the Langrishes--a once wealthy, highly respected Irish family--through the lives of their four daughters, especially the youngest, Imogen, whose love affair with a self-centered German scholar resonates throughout the book. Their relationship, told in lush, erotic, and occasionally melancholic prose, comes to represent not only the invasion and decline of this insular family, but the decline of Ireland and Western Europe as a whole in the years preceding World War II. In the tradition of great Irish writing, Higgins's prose is a direct descendent from that of James Joyce and Samuel Beckett, and nowhere else in his mastery of the language as evident as in Langrishe, Go Down, which the Irish Times applauded as ""the best Irish novel since At Swim-Two-Birds and the novels of Beckett.""",1564783529,9781564783523),Paperback,,252 pages,"

Based on Clifford’s own harrowing experience with drugs as a rock ’n’ roll wannabe in the 1990s, the book draws on the best of Kerouac & the Beats, injecting a heavy dose of pulp fiction as it threads a rollicking narrative through a doomed love triangle, lit up by the many strange characters he meets along the way.

He brought to vivid life the world as it might have been, where dinosaurs survived, where their intelligent descendants challenged humans for mastery of Earth, where a young hunter named Kerrick grew among the dinosaurs and rose to become their most feared enemy. Now, the awesome saga continues in ""Winter in Eden...""A new ice age threatens Earth. Facing extinction, the dinosaurs must employ their mastery of biology to swiftly reconquer human territory. Desperately, Kerrick launches an arduous quest to rally a final defense for humankind. With his beloved wife and young son, he heads north to the land of the whale hunters, east into the enemy's stronghold, and south to a fateful reckoning with destiny.Not since ""Dune"" has there been a work of such majestic scope and conception -- a monumental epic of passion, courage, and triumph.",0743412915,9780743412919),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","In 1946, an alien virus that rewrites human DNA was accidentally unleashed in the skies over New York City. It killed ninety percent of those it infected.  Nine percent survived to mutate into tragically deformed creatures.  And one percent gained superpowers.  The Wild Cards shared-universe series, created and edited since 1987 by New York Times #1 bestseller George R. R. Martin (""The American Tolkien"" --Time magazine) along with Melinda Snodgrass, is the tale of the history of the world since then—and of the heroes among the one percent.Now a new generation of heroes has taken its place on the world stage, its members crucial players in international events. At the United Nations, veteran ace John Fortune has assembled a team of young aces known as the Committee, to assist at trouble spots around the world–including a genocidal was in the Niger Delta, an invasion of zombies in hurricane ravaged New Orleans, and a freak nuclear explosion in a small Texas town.",0765317826,9780765317827),Hardcover,,398 pages,"

","First I was a sorcerer. Then I was a hermit. For so long—for years that seemed to go on forever—I couldn't bear to be touched. I put up not just walls but whole stone bunkers to keep everyone out, emotionally, and physically as well. I was protected from people, from ghosts, from specters real and imagined. Sure, I was alone. But I felt safe. Only, after a while, I wasn't sure any longer whether a totally ""safe"" empty life was really worth living. Then Tobin came along. Out of the blue, out of my past, with a summons from the king that he wouldn't let me ignore. I tried to cling to my isolation, but he wouldn't give up on me. Tobin never believed in walls.

","Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereBOOK THREE: TRISTAN & DANIKA THE IMPACT Tristan hit rock bottom, and no one felt the impact harder than Danika. She was forced to see, in the most brutal of ways, that love does not conquer all. Bruised, bloody, and broken she had to walk away. THE AFTERMATH Picking up the pieces of your life after a tragedy is a daunting prospect, and that’s considering you still own all of the pieces. But what if you don’t? What if someone else owns those pieces, and those pieces are a part of your soul? You dig deep and work with what you’ve got. That’s what Danika told herself and believed, every single day, for years. Tristan and Danika’s love had failed every test that life had thrown at them. She couldn’t forget that, not for one second. And if those tests had been overly harsh, well, she wasn’t one to wallow in self-pity. The failure was the thing she had to focus on. The failure was the lesson. She had no intention of working so hard to make it out of hell without learning that lesson well. THE REUNION Over six years after the night that changed everything, Danika finds herself forced to spend the weekend constantly in Tristan’s company, as they attend the wedding of two of their dearest friends. It’s been long enough that she feels they can be friendly again without it destroying her peace of mind, but just a small amount of time in his presence has her remembering something she had forced herself to forget: There’d been a reason she’d gone through hell with this man, for this man, some true good to precede the bad. She shocks herself by quickly giving in to a hunger that she never imagined could still consume her. Even the best intentioned denial has a breaking point. THE HARSH REALITY After everything that’s happened, the rise and the fall, the pain and the aftermath, can these two navigate the waters of acute regret, survive the trials of coming face to face with all that they have lost, and find the strength to try again?

","Twenty-nine-year-old Sophie Diehl is happy toiling away as a criminal law associate at an old line New England firm where she very much appreciates that most of her clients are behind bars. Everyone at Traynor, Hand knows she abhors face-to-face contact, but one weekend, with all the big partners away, Sophie must handle the intake interview for the daughter of the firm’s most important client. After eighteen years of marriage, Mayflower descendant Mia Meiklejohn Durkheim has just been served divorce papers in a humiliating scene at the popular local restaurant, Golightly’s. She is locked and loaded to fight her eminent and ambitious husband, Dr. Daniel Durkheim, Chief of the Department of Pediatric Oncology, for custody of their ten-year-old daughter Jane—and she also burns to take him down a peg. Sophie warns Mia that she’s never handled a divorce case before, but Mia can’t be put off. As she so disarmingly puts it: It’s her first divorce, too. Debut novelist Susan Rieger doesn’t leave a word out of place in this hilarious and expertly crafted debut that shines with the power and pleasure of storytelling. Told through personal correspondence, office memos, emails, articles, and legal papers, this playful reinvention of the epistolary form races along with humor and heartache, exploring the complicated family dynamic that results when marriage fails. For Sophie, the whole affair sparks a hard look at her own relationships—not only with her parents, but with colleagues, friends, lovers, and most importantly, herself. Much like Where’d You Go, Bernadette, The Divorce Papers will have you laughing aloud and thanking the literature gods for this incredible, fresh new voice in fiction.",English,English,Hardcover,,465 pages,"

","Emi Lost & Found series - Winner of the Best Happily Ever After of 2013 - HEA Bookshelf “Intense doesn't begin to cover it. I cried. I sobbed. I bawled. A lot. Constantly. Take my word when I say that you and Emi will become one. I felt every emotion as if I was in the story. I could have been Emi.” - Kelli, Alphas, Authors and Books Oh My Emi Hennigan could never have predicted her life would be like this. After wasting more than ten years being “just a friend” to her true love, Nate Wilson, Emi feels more than a little regret. Her future was set, though. Nate loved her as much as she loved him, and they were moving forward with a romance that took them both by surprise. They already knew their bad habits, quirks and the subtle nuances of expressions, but the love was all-encompassing and new to them both. No man could compete, Emi thought, until one night – one evening, one party, one journey, one second alters her course completely. That night, her brother’s confident best friend, Jack Holland, comes back into her life with a mission: to spend more time with Emi to prove he is the right man for her. A romance with him is the furthest thing from Emi’s mind, though, staying loyal and steadfast to a trusted man that she will always love. In a year’s time, though, Emi must learn to make changes she’d never before considered after being impacted by unexpected events. While her fragile spirit takes time to heal, Jack slowly finds a comfortable place in her life. Only time will tell if it’s right for Emi – and enough for him.

","Warning: This is not a typical love story. This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. It’s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesn’t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and develops—with hurt, sacrifice, and heartache—over the span of a lifetime. Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she’s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the club—but that’s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can’t live without. This is Eva and Deuce’s story. It wasn’t easy. Nothing worth doing ever is.And love is worth everything.",9781301741724,9781301741724,ebook,1st Edition,219 pages,"

","An enchanting first novel about love, madness, and Kenny G.The Silver Linings Playbook is the riotous and poignant story of how one man regains his memory and comes to terms with the magnitude of his wife’s betrayal.During the years he spends in a neural health facility, Pat Peoples formulates a theory about silver linings: he believes his life is a movie produced by God, his mission is to become physically fit and emotionally supportive, and his happy ending will be the return of his estranged wife, Nikki. When Pat goes to live with his parents, everything seems changed: no one will talk to him about Nikki; his old friends are saddled with families; the Philadelphia Eagles keep losing, making his father moody; and his new therapist seems to be recommending adultery as a form of therapy.When Pat meets the tragically widowed and clinically depressed Tiffany, she offers to act as a liaison between him and his wife, if only he will give up watching football, agree to perform in this year’s Dance Away Depression competition, and promise not to tell anyone about their “contract.” All the while, Pat keeps searching for his silver lining.In this brilliantly written debut novel, Matthew Quick takes us inside Pat’s mind, deftly showing us the world from his distorted yet endearing perspective. The result is a touching and funny story that helps us look at both depression and love in a wonderfully refreshing way.",0374264260,9780374264260),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","“A freak accident landed both of the Khavalov twins under my command, just before a routine mission turned into a nightmare. I brought home one twin in a coffin and the other in a coma missing his leg. I did everything right – and still people died. I can’t forget that night or how many lives it changed, including mine. It’s natural for their sister, Katya, to blame me. I made one decision in the middle of a firefight, and it shattered her sheltered world. I’m the ice to her fire, and when we first meet, it’s not pretty. I don’t fear war or death, and I am definitely not going to let a beautiful woman with a quick temper and broken heart scare me off, either. I know she’s hurting, and I’m determined to make sure she’s okay. It’s the least I can do for the twins. I may have failed them that night, but I won’t fail her. What I’m not counting on: the feelings she ignites within me.” – Captain Sawyer Mathis A standalone novel in the Sons of War contemporary military romance series.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,207 pages,"

","Balys Sruoga was a well-known Lithuanian poet, dramatist, and literary critic. In 1943, professor of Vilnius University, he was deported to Stutthof concentration camp (along with other professors, under the charge of campaigning students against joining the Reich troops). Having returned from Stutthof, he wrote a fictional memoir book Forest of the Gods, to become not only a heart- stirring document but also one of the finest specimens of Lithuanian prose.The author transforms his painful personal experience into an ironic and grotesque narrative. The very title of the memoir book is ironic as „the factory of death“ is given a poetic name of the grove of gods. The concentration camp becomes a miniature model of the absurdity of the world. The book abounds in cultural implications and reflections on the status of our civilisation. The Stoic posture of the narrator in the face of absurd makes it comparable to Existentialist literature. The manuscript of Forest of the Godswas banned from publication by Stalin regime as a „cynical ridicule of the victims of German invaders“. It was first published in 1957, ten years after the death of Balys Sruoga.",B00B2PP79Q,B00B2PP79Q,Kindle Edition,,410 pages,"

Functioning as an atelier, it forecasts the writing of a novel, which does not materialize as such; the journal itself -- a mausoleum of lovers -- comes to take its place. The sensual exigencies and untempered forms of address in this epistolary work, often compared to Barthes' A Lover's Discourse, use the letter and the photograph in a work that hovers between forms, in anticipation of its own disintegration.",2070427579,9782070427574),Paperback,,561 pages,"

","This diary written by Aya Kitō (July 19, 1962 - May 23, 1988) was published shortly before her death. Aya Kitō was diagnosed with a disease called spinocerebellar degeneration when she was 15 years old. The disease causes the person to lose control over their body, but because the person can retain all mental ability the disease acts as a prison. So in the end she cannot eat, walk or talk.Aya keeps a diary of not only what she does but how she feels and the hardships she must endure. Initially, the diary's purpose was for Kitō to chronicle impressions she had about how the disease was affecting her daily life. As the disease progressed, however, the diary became Kitō's outlet for describing the intense personal struggles she underwent in coping, adapting, and ultimately trying to survive her disease. As she notes in one entry, ""I write because writing is evidence that I am still alive.""Through family, medical examinations and rehabilitations, and finally succumbing to the disease, Aya must cope with the disease and live on with life until her death at the age of 25.",9789792721287,9789792721287,paperback,,,"

","In the literary world, there is little that can match the excitement of opening a new book by David Markson. From Wittgenstein’s Mistress to Reader’s Block to Springer’s Progress to This Is Not a Novel, he has delighted and amazed readers for decades. And now comes his latest masterwork, Vanishing Point, wherein an elderly writer (identified only as ""Author"") sets out to transform shoeboxes crammed with notecards into a novel — and in so doing will dazzle us with an astonishing parade of revelations about the trials and calamities and absurdities and often even tragedies of the creative life — all the while trying his best (he says) to keep himself out of the tale. Naturally he will fail to do the latter, frequently managing to stand aside and yet remaining undeniably central throughout — until he is swept inevitably into the narrative’s startling and shattering climax. A novel of death and laughter both — and of extraordinary intellectual richness.",1593760108,9781593760106),Paperback,,191 pages,"

An alien advance party was suddenly nosing around my planet. 

Worse, they were lawyering up. . . .

 
In the hilarious tradition of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Rob Reid takes you on a headlong journey through the outer reaches of the universe—and the inner workings of our absurdly dysfunctional music industry.   Low-level entertainment lawyer Nick Carter thinks it’s a prank, not an alien encounter, when a redheaded mullah and a curvaceous nun show up at his office. But Frampton and Carly are highly advanced (if bumbling) extraterrestrials. And boy, do they have news.   The entire cosmos, they tell him, has been hopelessly hooked on humanity’s music ever since “Year Zero” (1977 to us), when American pop songs first reached alien ears. This addiction has driven a vast intergalactic society to commit the biggest copyright violation since the Big Bang. The resulting fines and penalties have bankrupted the whole universe. We humans suddenly own everything—and the aliens are not amused.   Nick Carter has just been tapped to clean up this mess before things get ugly, and he’s an unlikely galaxy-hopping hero: He’s scared of heights. He’s also about to be fired. And he happens to have the same name as a Backstreet Boy. But he does know a thing or two about copyright law. And he’s packing a couple of other pencil-pushing superpowers that could come in handy.   Soon he’s on the run from a sinister parrot and a highly combustible vacuum cleaner. With Carly and Frampton as his guides, Nick now has forty-eight hours to save humanity, while hopefully wowing the hot girl who lives down the hall from him.",0345534417,9780345534415),Hardcover,,364 pages,"

","La capacità di Massimo Gramellini di dare risposte incontra il talento di Chiara Gamberale di sollevare dubbi.Gioconda detta Giò ha trentacinque anni, una storia familiare complicata alle spalle, un’anima inquieta per vocazione o forse per necessità e un unico, grande amore: Leonardo. Che però l’ha abbandonata. Smarrita e disperata, si ritrova a vivere a casa dei suoi nonni, morti a distanza di pochi giorni e simbolo di un amore perfetto, capace di fare vincere la passione sul tempo che passa: proprio quello che non è riuscito al matrimonio di Giò. La notte di San Valentino, festa che lei ha sempre ignorato, Giò trova un biglietto che sua nonna aveva scritto all’angelo custode, per ringraziarlo. Con lo sconforto, ma anche il coraggio, di chi non ha niente da perdere, Giò ci prova: scrive anche lei al suo angelo. Che, incredibilmente, le risponde. E le fa una promessa: avrò cura di te. Poi rilancia. L’angelo non solo ha una fortissima personalità, ma ha un nome: Filèmone, ha una storia. Soprattutto ha la capacità di comprendere Giò come Giò non si è mai compresa. Di ascoltarla come non si è mai ascoltata. Nasce così uno scambio intenso, divertente, divertito, commovente, che coinvolge anche le persone che circondano Giò: il puntiglioso ex marito, la madre fricchettona, l’amica intrappolata in una relazione extraconiugale, una deflagrante guida turistica argentina, un ragazzino che vuole rinchiudersi in una comune... Uno scambio che indaga non solo le mancate ragioni di Giò: ma le mancate ragioni di ognuno di loro. Perché a ognuno di loro, grazie a Filèmone, voce dell’interiorità prima che dell’aldilà, sia possibile silenziare la testa e l’istinto. Per ascoltare il cuore. Anche e soprattutto quando è chiamato a rispondere a prove complicate, come quella a cui sarà messa davanti Giò proprio dal suo fedele Filèmone, in un finale sorprendente che sembrerà confondere tutto. Ma a tutto darà un senso.",B00OKFB5P0,B00OKFB5P0,Kindle Edition,,186 pages,"

","Long known as ""The Great Communicator,"" Ronald Reagan has been credited with leading an ideological renaissance of the Republican Party and has become an icon to many Republicans and party leaders. Now, ten years following his death, and twenty-five years following the end of his two terms in office, the man who was credited with so much, including ""Reaganomics,"" ending the Cold War, and ""The War on Drugs,"" has become the ideological standard-bearer for a party that bears little resemblance to the one that he helped to define. So much so, that in hindsight, many of his views and policies appear to be centrist in comparison. This provides the perfect opportunity for The Editors of TIME magazine, in conjunction with many highly-regarded and well-respected writers and journalists familiar with Reagan, including Lou Cannon, Jon Meacham, Nick Clooney, Bob Spitz, and more with an introduction by Joe Scarborough, to examine the man, the politician, and the President, and the paradox of an ideological hero who no longer represents the party that he helped to define, or in fact, does he?",English,English,Kindle Edition,,224 pages,"

","The instant New York Times bestseller and publishing phenomenon: Marina Keegan’s posthumous collection of award-winning essays and stories “sparkles with talent, humanity, and youth” (O, The Oprah Magazine).Marina Keegan’s star was on the rise when she graduated magna cum laude from Yale in May 2012. She had a play that was to be produced at the New York Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at The New Yorker. Tragically, five days after graduation, Marina died in a car crash.Marina left behind a rich, deeply expansive trove of writing that, like her title essay, captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation. Her short story “Cold Pastoral” was published on NewYorker.com. Her essay “Even Artichokes Have Doubts” was excerpted in the Financial Times, and her book was the focus of a Nicholas Kristof column in The New York Times. Millions of her contemporaries have responded to her work on social media. As Marina wrote: “We can still do anything. We can change our minds. We can start over…We’re so young. We can’t, we MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it’s all we have.” The Opposite of Loneliness is an unforgettable collection of Marina’s essays and stories that articulates the universal struggle all of us face as we figure out what we aspire to be and how we can harness our talents to impact the world. “How do you mourn the loss of a fiery talent that was barely a tendril before it was snuffed out? Answer: Read this book. A clear-eyed observer of human nature, Keegan could take a clever idea...and make it something beautiful” (People).",1476753628,9781476753621),ebook,,241 pages,"

Her doting parents want her to make a good match with a worthy gentleman and live a respectable life. She is beautiful and intelligent and she comes with a hefty dowry. There is no reason that she shouldn’t be able to find an eligible man and settle down.Tessa herself is the reason. The men who are attempting to court her are, in her opinion, boring and conceited. Not only that, Tessa craves excitement and adventure, of which there is little in her social circles. By chance, she comes across an advertisement for a bride brokerage company seeking eligible women of good breeding to go west and find husbands.One man on the list catches her eye and she begins corresponding with him, eventually agreeing to go to Montana to meet him. She can’t resist the possibility of finding someone different and even if she doesn’t, the adventure itself would be worth her time. Tessa makes a successful escape and sets out to make a new life in Montana.Dean Samuels is a Montana rancher who is in over his head. His ranch is struggling and his two children are unruly and in need of a caretaker. It’s clear to his younger brother, Marcus, that he needs help. He tells Dean about a mail order bride service and convinces him that he should utilize it to find a wife.After his wife, Sarah, had passed away, Dean never intended to marry again. His ranch and his children became his life. However, it becomes apparent that Sadie, his daughter, and his son, Jack, need stability and love. The demands of raising his children and keeping his head above water financially have taken a toll and Dean grudgingly gives in to Marcus’ idea.Sarah had been the love of his life and Dean doesn’t intend to let any other woman into his heart. He’s locked those kinds of emotions deep inside, not wanting to take the chance of getting hurt like that again. Because Dean has trouble expressing his feelings in writing, his younger brother Marcus agrees to help write the letters to Tessa. Dean is happy to leave that part up to him.When Dean and Tessa meet, sparks fly between the two strong willed people. Tessa is disappointed that Dean isn’t the romantic, sophisticated man she was lead to believe he was in the letters she received. Dean is aggravated that she isn’t a meek woman who is easily managed. Never mind the fact that she has no idea of how to take care of children and keep a home.Dean and Tessa struggle to find common ground and make their marriage work. Will they each take the risk and open their hearts to one another? Can their marriage survive and will they find love and contentment in each other?

","Disgusted with God’s plan for Judgment Day, Satan has quit his job and abandoned Hell in favor of a quiet retirement in Washington, D.C. But life on Earth is tricky for an ex-angel with a short fuse and no impulse control. When a parking attendant mysteriously bursts into flames and a weight-challenged woman somehow ends up in low-Earth orbit, Satan finds that he has attracted the attention of several meddlesome federal agencies. Even worse, there are signs that the governor of Texas has somehow gone ahead and started up the end of the world without him.The Prince of Darkness heads for the Lone Star State, where he tangles with a megalomaniacal televangelist, joins the Militant Arm of the American Geriatrics Association, and wields the Flaming Shotgun of Divine Justice at a guy whose hobbies include invading churches to denounce ritualized cannibalism. Through it all, one thing is clear: Someone has to put a stop to Judgment Day.

","From #1 New York Times best-selling author Sandra Brown comes a heart-pounding story of survival, that takes the age-old question, ""Does the end justify the means?"" and turns it on its head.Dr. Emory Charbonneau, a pediatrician and marathon runner, disappears on a mountain road in North Carolina. By the time her husband Jeff, miffed over a recent argument, reports her missing, the trail has grown cold. Literally. Fog and ice encapsulate the mountainous wilderness and paralyze the search for her.While police suspect Jeff of ""instant divorce,"" Emory, suffering from an unexplained head injury, regains consciousness and finds herself the captive of a man whose violent past is so dark that he won't even tell her his name. She's determined to escape him, and willing to take any risks necessary to survive. Unexpectedly, however, the two have a dangerous encounter with people who adhere to a code of justice all their own. At the center of the dispute is a desperate young woman whom Emory can't turn her back on, even if it means breaking the law. Wrong becomes right at the hands of the man who strikes fear, but also sparks passion.As her husband's deception is revealed, and the FBI closes in on her captor, Emory begins to wonder if the man with no name is, in fact, her rescuer from those who wish her dead - and from heartbreak.Combining the nail-biting suspense and potent storytelling that has made Sandra Brown one of the world's best loved authors, MEAN STREAK is a wildly compelling novel about love, deceit, and the choices we must make in order to survive.",1455581127,9781455581122),Hardcover,,409 pages,"

","El universo rural de Venezuela ha tenido numerosos y aventajados retratistas. Orlando Araujo es uno de ellos. Pero la anécdota y el paisaje que pone en escena el periodista, crítico y narrador hincado en la melancolía andina, se detiene en el merodeo infinito del instante, como i cada presente, cada estampa, expresara una esencia eterna que exhibe pausadamente sus reiterados detalles, a través de muchas voces que se relevan para hacer penetrar en el relato la geografía o la historia, como un mosaico de tiempos, espacios y pensamientos. Es ese lugar irreductible de la memoria el que explora Araujo, con una mirada que se infiltra descriptiva y reflexivamente para alcanzar un estado intemporal donde se anula todo anacronismo, a favor de una extemporalidad y una simultaneidad perpetua de los hechos. ""Siete Cuentos"" fue publicado por primera vez en 1977. La presente edición comprende, para nuestra sorpresa, un total de trece relatos, con los que agrupa y da una completa muestra de las tres líneas de desarrollo temático que hicieron de él una de las grandes referencias literarias de su época: aquella Venezuela de los años 1970 en que aún resonaban como ecos los tiroteos de la lucha armada. El costumbrismo crítico, la crudeza histórico-política y la ensoñación mágico-infantil, son los campos entrelazados donde la intrusión de un narrador que se convierte en elemento y personaje del instante explayado por él mismo, es la de un lirismo que poetiza una estampa acusadora, dolorida y aún viviente.",8401442516,9788401442513),Paperback,Rotativa,112 pages,"

The town of Ringgold, Georgia, has a population of 1,923, one traffic light, one Dairy Queen, and one Catherine Grace Cline. The daughter of Ringgold's third-generation Baptist preacher, Catherine Grace is quick-witted, more than a little stubborn, and dying to escape her small-town life. Every Saturday afternoon, she sits at the Dairy Queen, eating Dilly Bars and plotting her getaway to Atlanta. And when, with the help of a family friend, the dream becomes a reality, she immediately packs her bags, leaving her family and the boy she loves to claim the life she's always imagined. But before things have even begun to get off the ground in Atlanta, tragedy brings Catherine Grace back home. As a series of extraordinary events alter her perspective and sweeping changes come to Ringgold itself Catherine Grace begins to wonder if her place in the world may actually be, against all odds, right where she began. Intelligent, charming, and utterly readable, Looking for Salvation at the Dairy Queen marks the debut of a talented new literary voice.",0307395014,9780307395016),Hardcover,,293 pages,"

In this simple and practical book, Doug Wilson offers a richer and more comprehensive theology of marriage than in his prior works. Here he grounds marriage in the life of the Trinity and in the life of the church. Marriage is intended to be a glorious picture of the gospel, and marriages grounded elsewhere regularly create a small hell on earth.

","Set against the epic backdrop of the battle of Troy, Troilus and Criseyde is an evocative story of love and loss. When Troilus, the son of Priam, falls in love with the beautiful Criseyde, he is able to win her heart with the help of his cunning uncle Pandarus, and the lovers experience a brief period of bliss together. But the pair are soon forced apart by the inexorable tide of war and - despite their oath to remain faithful - Troilus is ultimately betrayed. Regarded by many as the greatest love poem of the Middle Ages, Troilus and Criseyde skilfully combines elements of comedy and tragedy to form an exquisite meditation on the fragility of romantic love, and the fallibility of humanity.",0140442391,9780140442397),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","В тази книга са събрани и подредени записките на двама души — на светогорски монах, наричан поп Алигорко, и на френски дворянин, пленен при Кандия и приел исляма, наричан Венецианеца. И двамата съвременници описват едно и също събитие — разорението и помохамеданчването на родопската долина Елинденя през лятото на 1668 година. Поп Алигорко го е гледал откъм страната на българските родопчани. Венецианеца — от страната на турците. Много пъти и двамата описват една и съща случка и ясно се вижда как различните гледни точки и различното осветление променят очертанията на събитията. Тия повторни, макар и различни, описания почти винаги са избягвани, за да намери място само това от тях, което е по-пълно и по-обективно. Двата ръкописа са преведени и преработени. Записките на поп Алигорко са написани на чудновата смесица от черковнославянски книжовен език и родопски говор. Венецианеца е писал на френски. Повече съкращения са правени в записките на Венецианеца, защото, макар и някъде да се е мъчил да изтегли на заден план собствените си преживявания, другаде той доста често говори за себе си. Съкратени са и разсъжденията му върху насилието, промяната на убеждения и вяра, кръвното родство и духовното братство между хората и върху други подобни проблеми. Поп Алигорко, обратно, по всички начини се мъчи да избегне думата „аз“ и в някои части на записките говори за себе си в трето лице. Целта на преработката беше двете съставки на книгата да се приближат по дух и език, за да не се чувствува така рязко двойното авторство. А целта на книгата най-добре е изразена от летописците — да не позволи да се изличат от паметта на потомците делата и подвизите на ония силни люде, живели триста години преди нас по великата Родопа. Преди всеки откъс от летописа на поп Алигорко има няколко реда от народна песен, и тя намерена в записките му.",8498191238,9788498191233),Hardcover,Златна колекция ХХ век №30,575 pages,"

","         Anna Karenina left her husband for a dashing officer. Lady Chatterley left hers for the gamekeeper. Now Alice Coombs has her boyfriend for nothing … nothing at all.  Just how that should have come to pass and what Philip Engstrand, Alice’s spurned boyfriend, can do about it is the premise for this vertiginous speculative romance by the acclaimed author of Gun, with Occasional Music.          Alice Coombs is a particle physicist, and she and her colleagues have created a void, a hole in the universe, that they have taken to calling Lack. But Lack is a nullity with taste—tastes; it absorbs a pomegranate, light bulbs, an argyle sock; it disdains a bow tie, an ice ax, and a scrambled duck egg. To Alice, this selectivity translates as an irresistible personality. To Philip, it makes Lack an unbeatable rival, for how can he win Alice back from something that has no flaws—because it has no qualities? Ingenious, hilarious, and genuinely mind-expanding, As She Climbed Across the Table is the best boy-meets-girl-meets-void story ever written.",0375700129,9780375700125),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","A compulsively readable, deeply human novel that examines our most basic and unquenchable emotion: want.  With his critically acclaimed first novel Dear American Airlines, Jonathan Miles was widely praised as a comic genius “after something bigger” (David Ulin, Los Angeles Times) whose fiction was “not just philosophically but emotionally rewarding” (Richard Russo, New York Times Book Review, front cover). Now, in his much anticipated second novel, Want Not, Miles takes a giant leap forward with this highly inventive and corrosively funny story of our times, a three-pronged tale of human excess that sifts through the detritus of several disparate lives—lost loves, blown chances, countless words and deeds misdirected or misunderstood—all conjoined in their come-hell-or-high-water search for fulfillment.As the novel opens on Thanksgiving Day, readers are telescoped into three different worlds in various states of disrepair—a young freegan couple living off the grid in New York City; a once-prominent linguist, sacked at midlife by the dissolution of his marriage and his father’s losing battle with Alzheimer’s; and a self-made debt-collecting magnate, whose brute talent for squeezing money out of unlikely places has yielded him a royal existence, trophy wife included.Want and desire propel these characters forward toward something, anything, more, until their worlds collide, briefly, randomly, yet irrevocably, in a shattering ending that will haunt readers long after the last page is turned.With a satirist’s eye and a romantic’s heart, Miles captures the morass and comedy of contemporary life in all its excess. Bold, unblinking, unforgettable in its irony and pathos, Want Not is a wicked, bighearted literary novel that confirms the arrival of a major voice in American fiction.

","كثيرون كتبوا في سيرة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وقدموا آلاف المجلدات.. ومع هذا فإن في السيرة العطرة النيِّرة جوانب مهمة لم تأخذ حقها من التأمل والدراسة.ولقد عرضت المؤلفة خلال هذه الصفحات معالم ومواقف من هدي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم استفادتها من سيرته الشريفة.. تقدمها إلى الشباب وإلى جيل الغد لينظروا فيها.وإذن فليس هذا البحث عرضًا لأحداث جرت في حياة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وإنما هي دروس راقية تنظر بعين جديدة إلى تلك الحياة الزاخرة التي استمرت في الأرض المقدسة ثلاثًا وعشرين سنة غيرت وجه الدنيا تغييرًا جذريًا.~~~إن سيرة الرسول -صلى الله عليه وسلم- معين لا ينضب لكل دارس ومتأمل، ففيها الوقائع والسير والدروس والعبر التي تمد من يتأملها ويعمل بهديها بالعون على مصاعب الحياة متاعبها.في هذه الرواية الجديدة للسيرة تبدأ المؤلفة باستعراض البيئة التي نشأ فيها الرسول الأعظم، والحالة الاجتماعية التي كانت سائدة في ذلك الوقت وكيف كانت الأسر والقبائل والعشائر تتصارع وتتعايش أحيانًا، في هذه المنطقة، رغم اختلافاتها الدينية.ثم كيف عانى الرسول -صلى الله عليه وسلم- من اليتم والحياة الصعبة بعدأن توفي جده ومن ثم كفله عمه، لتبدأ معها رحلة ثانية مختلفة في مهمتها ومسؤوليتها وهي رحلة الدعوة إلى الله الواحد الأحد.ماذا قدمت للرسول -صلى الله عليه وسلم- أسرته وزوجته وأعمامه وعشيرته؟ وماهي مواقفها من دعوته التي كانت جديدة عليهم في نهجها وأفكارها؟ما نوع الصراع الذي جرى بين الدعوة الجديدة، والمجتمع الآبائي الذي يأبى أن يغير ما رباه عليه الآباء والأجداد.ثم كيف أسس الرسول -صلى الله عليه وسلم- المجتمع المؤمن المتكافل والمتراحم في المدينة؟ ليصبح مثالاً وحلمًا لكل فرد ومجتمع مسلم، برغم شح الموارد وضيق ذات اليد. ولكن لم يرضِ هذا الوضع أهل مكة الجاهليين فبدأ الصراع المسلح يأخذ مجراه مع المسلمين في شكل غزوات والمعارك المتتالية.ولكن شاء الله أن تكون النصرة للدعوة التوحيد والسلم والعدل والإحسان على قوى الشر السائدة.إن السيرة النبوية نبراس لكل مسلم يهتدي بها في حياته. وكتاب ""هدي السيرة النبوية"" جاء من هذا الباب ليمد المسلم بالدروس والعبر المستخلصة والعمل بها.~~~يتناول هذا الكتاب معالم ومواقف من هدي السيرة النبوية في التغيير الاجتماعي، وكيف اختار الله النبي محمدًا -صلى الله عليه وسلم- وأعده فكريًا ونفسيًا وأخلاقيًا واجتماعيًا.ويتحدث عن نزول الوحي وبدء التكليف بالدعوة وخطتها في مكة، وعالميتها، وظهورها، والمقاطعة القرشيّة للمؤمنين، وهجرة بعضهم، ومواساة الله للنبي -صلى الله عليه وسلم- في عام الحزن بالإسراء والمعراج، أول رحلة فضائية للإنسان، والهجرة إلى المدينة وتأسيس المجتمع المؤمن فيها.ويسجل الإذن بالقتال وبدء السرايا والغزوات مع التأمل في بدايتها وفي غزوات بدر وأحد والخندق ونقض اليهود لعهودهم، وحكم سعد بن معاذ في بني قريظة.ويتناول أحداثًا في الحبشة، وزواجًا بأمر الله، وأخبار بني المصطلق، والغارة على المدينة، ومنع قريش النبي -صلى الله عليه وسلم- من أداء العمرة، والتوصل إلى صلح الحديبية، ثم الخروج إلى خيبر وإنهاء الكيان السياسي لليهود في الجزيرة، وأداء النبي -صلى الله عليه وسلم- عمرة القضاء، وإسلام عمرو بن العاص، ويبحث في غزوة مؤتة، وإرسال النبي -صلى الله عليه وسلم- الكتب إلى ملوك الدول ورؤسائها.ويعرض لفتح مكة وحصار الطائف وغزوة تبوك، وعام الوفود وعام البعوث، وإمارة أسامة بن زيد الشاب على جيش فيه كبار الصحابة، وحجة الوداع وخطبته فيها، وآخر وصاياه، وموقف الناس وأبي بكر الصديق من موته، مع لقطات أخيرة في مباشرته إلغاء الرق، وأمره بتعلم كتاب يهود، وبيان السر في نجاح الدعوة الإسلامية في دروس راقية تزخر بالحياة.",1575479265,1575479265,Paperback,,872 pages,"

I can’t make water boil, or make the wind blow; I can’t even light a match without the aid of a flint. My 18th birthday is in six months, and if I don’t pass the Paranormal Safety Exams (PSEs) by then, I will be banished to the Isle of Shadows for eternity, never to be seen again – it will be as though I never existed.I found myself at the halfway house under the supervision and guidance of Den Mother and telepathic empath, Eloise Mayflower. The halfway house is the last chance for troubled paranormal teens like me to pass our PSEs and avoid banishment. Eloise knows everything I think and feel, and is supposed to be helping me, but I still can’t do basic spells a six-year-old can do. I hate it here, but I have no choice. This is my last chance.I had all but given up hope, when in walks Bohdan Drak. Tall, dark, and so damn sexy it hurts to look at him – even his muscles had muscles. He is a dragon shifter and wears the mark of having passed his PSEs. When our souls meet, we realize we have found our soul mates and perfect matches. My dying hope has found life again, and I finally have a reason to look forward to a future.I thought everything would be fine, but darkness and despair creep into my future. I have been framed for a murder, and everyone believes I am guilty. The paranormal council now watches my every move. Can I trust Bohdan and true love?

","When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium with Y.S. Rajan in 1998, little did they expect the magnitude of the response they would get. The idea that India could actually be a developed nation in a short time rather than remain condemned to a subsistence diet of marginal improvements and promises struck a chord among readers. The book continues to be a best-seller.Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India goes the logical next step and examines why, given all our skills, resources and talents, we, so obviously capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What is it that we as a nation are missing? For at the heart of Ignited Minds is an irresistible premise: the people of a nation have the power, by dint of hard work, to realize their dream of a truly good life.Kalam offers no formulaic prescription in Ignited Minds. Instead, he takes up different issues and themes that struck him on his pilgrimage around the country as he met thousands of school children, teachers, scientists and saints and seers in the course of two years: the necessity for a patriotism that transcends religion and politics; for role models who point out the path to take; and for confidence in ourselves and in our strengths.Who was he to write on so large a theme, he wondered as he started writing this book. But at the end, Kalam’s humility notwithstanding, this may well prove to be the book that motivates us to get back on the winning track and unleash the energy within a nation that hasn’t allowed itself full rein.",B008X3PAX8,B008X3PAX8,Kindle Edition,,224 pages,"

","A boozing, sex-obsessed writer finds himself employed by the Catholic Church (an institution he loathes) to proofread a 1,100 page report on the army's massacre and torture of thousands of indigenous villagers a decade earlier, including the testimonies of the survivors. The writer's job is to tidy it up: he rants, ""that was what my work was all about, cleaning up and giving a manicure to the Catholic hands that were piously getting ready to squeeze the balls of the military tiger."" Mesmerized by the strange Vallejo-like poetry of the Indians' phrases (""the houses they were sad because no people were inside them""), the increasingly agitated and frightened writer is endangered twice over: by the spell the strangely beautiful heart-rending voices exert over his tenuous sanity, and by real danger—after all, the murderers are the very generals who still run this unnamed Latin American country.",0811217078,9780811217071),Paperback,,142 pages,"

","The Mossad is widely recognized today as the best intelligence service in the world. It is also the most enigmatic, shrouded in secrecy. Mossad: The Greatest Missions of the Israeli Secret Service unveils the defi ning and most dangerous operations that have shaped Israel and the world at large from the agency's more than sixty-year history, among them: the capture of Adolf Eichmann, the eradication of Black September, the destruction of the Syrian nuclear facility, and the elimination of key Iranian nuclear scientists.Through intensive research and exclusive interviews with Israeli leaders and Mossad agents, authors Michael Bar-Zohar and Nissim Mishal re-create these missions in riveting detail, vividly bringing to life the heroic operatives who risked everything in the face of unimaginable danger. In the words of Shimon Peres, president of Israel, this gripping, white-knuckle read ""tells what should have been known and isn't--that Israel's hidden force is as formidable as its recognized physical strength.""",0062123408,9780062123404),Hardcover,,388 pages,"

","For six years, Alec Milius has been trying to escape his past, but his past refuses to release him. Abandoned by MI6 after a disastrous operation against the CIA, Milius has slowly rebuilt his life in Madrid. Older and wiser than the young spy who first caught the eye of British Intelligence, Milius still has a talent for deception-and a fatal weakness for secrets. So when a prominent politician disappears under suspicious circumstances, Milius can't resist tracking him down. But the rules have changed. Alec is now working alone, outside the boundaries of any official agency. Paranoid and expendable, he soon becomes vulnerable to the ruthless duplicities of a secret world in which no one can be trusted. Yet as he comes face to face with the nightmare of modern terror, Alec is given one last chance for redemption.",014101783X,9780141017839),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","St. Catherine of Siena experienced her first mystical experience when she was only six years old, finding herself able to view guardian angels as clearly as she could see the people they protected. She became a Dominican tertiary at sixteen, and had numerous visions of Christ, The Blessed Virgin Mary and many saints. Although she never had any formal education, St. Catherine was one of the most brilliant theological minds of the 14th - or any - Century. Her visionary THE DIALOGUE, was dictated during a state of ecstasy while in dialogue with God the Father, and is considered among the most brilliant writings in the history of the Catholic Church. She died at the tender age thirty-three, and her body was found incorrupt in 1430. In 1940, Pope Pius XII named her a joint Patron Saint of Italy along with Saint Francis of Assisi. Pope Paul VI gave her the title of Doctor of the Church in 1970, along with Saint Teresa of Ávila, making them the first women to receive this honor.",B003QP4GQ0,B003QP4GQ0,Kindle Edition,,206 pages,"

","Taereun: Battleground of the Damned was never really a game. It was a testing ground to find minds and souls for the The Nameless God to use, and for tens of thousands of players, the game became reality, when they were put in the bodies of their characters. The Nameless God told them that he would return them to their real lives, if they fought through the Labyrinth of Yggr and freed his body from beneath the city of Haven. After searching for over 11 years, they found the Gate leading to Haven.After being murdered right before the gate to Haven was opened, Mark McGuinness wakes up in a hospital in his original body. As a child, he was in an automobile accident. A freak whose body rejects most medical treatments, he was left scarred and disfigured. Angry, bitter and disgusted with the world, he had used Taereun: Battleground of the Damned to take out his frustration and anger, so he would not lose control and hurt or kill someone in real life. The closest he had ever come to being happy was living as Talon, during the eleven year search for Haven.Having learned about the Power called ki, Mark McGuinness discovers that his human body is capable of channeling and using it. Once again armed with Power, he finds a way to travel from Earth to Taereun. He has questions he wants answered and people he owes. Whether mortal or divine, he will let no one and nothing stand in his way.WARNING: For Mature Audiences Only.

","O livro começa como um relatório de polícia, descrevendo a vida de um gang numa zona a que se chama simplesmente Bairro e que nos pode fazer evocar um qualquer bairro periférico de uma grande cidade.A legião que é referida no título reporta-se a uma citação do Evangelho de São Lucas, mais precisamente ao seguinte excerto: ««(...) Quando desceu para terra veio-lhes ao encontro um homem da cidade, possesso de vários demónios, que desde há muito não se vestia nem vivia em casa mas nos túmulos. Ao ver Jesus prostrou-se diante dele, gritando em alta voz: 'Que tens que ver comigo Jesus, filho de Deus altíssimo? Peço-te que não me atormentes!» (...) Jesus perguntou-lhe: 'Qual é o teu nome?' 'O meu nome é Legião'. respondeu.Porque muitos demónios tinham entrado nele e suplicavam-lhe que os não mandasse para o abismo.Com O Meu Nome é Legião percorremos, como se fosse a nossa vida, a vida de pessoas que vivem na pior parte do pior sítio do mundo . pessoas que são muitos, sendo o mesmo, e sendo esse «mesmo» uma parte oculta, desesperada e silenciosa de nós, que se esforça por acreditar que há uma salvação.Cruzam-se histórias, tendo quase sempre como pano de fundo o bairro; os conflitos homem/mulher, ricos/probres, brancos/pretos; as histórias não acabam, e é normal - o autor mostra-nos que aquilo que existe de mais parecido com a salvação é esquecer tudo o que aconteceu e pensar:«Não tenho medo de vocês, não tenho medo de nada».",9722032259,9789722032254),Paperback,,380 pages,"

","R.K. Narayan (1906-2001) is unusual among Indian authors writing in English in that he has stayed contentedly in his home country, venturing abroad only rarely. He rarely addresses political issues or tries to explore the cutting edge of fiction. He is a traditional teller of tales, a creator of realist fiction which is often gentle, humorous, and warm rather than hard-hitting or profound. Almost all of his writings are set in the fictional city of Malgudi, and are narrowly focused on the lives of relatively humble individuals, neither extremely poor nor very rich.The Guide is one of his most interesting books, which begins as a comic look at the life of a rogue, but evolves into something quite different. It should be noted that Narayan is not a devout Hindu, and has accused Westerners of wrongly supposing that all Indians are deeply spiritual beings; but it is also true that he was deeply impressed by some experiences he had with a medium after the sudden death of his young wife (described movingly in The English Teacher (1945).Narayan has stated that the incident of the reluctant holy man was based on a real event which he read about in the newspaper.Formerly India's most corrupt tourist guide, Raju--just released from prison--seeks refuge in an abandoned temple. Mistaken for a holy man, he plays the part and succeeds so well that God himself intervenes to put Raju's newfound sanctity to the test. Narayan's most celebrated novel, The Guide won him the National Prize of the Indian Literary Academy, his country's highest literary honor.",0143039644,9780143039648),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","An absorbing novel of crime, its terrifying consequences, and a bond that redefines the friendship of three restless young men. Wall Street speculators, the Manhattan downtown club scene, Russian gangsters, immigrant neighborhoods - all the elements in the urban turf of this finely crafted contemporary crime novel wed danger with excitement and possibility. They're the rewards that Monty Brogan, who stands at the center of the moral glare in this tale, has already lost, just as he's lost his Corvette, and the ""sway"" that opened the doors of exclusive night spots and guaranteed him courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow Monty's traveling by bus, to the federal prison in Otisville, for seven years. He's afraid, and all he'd ever really wanted when he grew up was to be a fireman. With the pulse of the city in its prose, this debut novel follows Monty through the twenty-four hours of his last day out. At the same time, it illuminates the worlds, and souls, of his two best friends: Frank Slattery, an edgy bond trader who gambles daily with financial ruin, and Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who clings to illusions as he compromises his ideals. Friends since their high school days, the three of them nostalgically share a past, but warily they confront a future that can no longer accommodate their adolescent dreams. They meet. They drink, and talk, go clubbing, dance, drink, and remember. What neither Slattery nor Jakob know, however, is that Monty has a plan. It's a shocker.Originally published: New York: Carroll & Graf Pub., 2000.",0452284198,9780452284197),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Movido por su sed de peligros y aventuras, el jovencísimo Ernst Jünger —tenía entonces diecinueve años— se alistó voluntariamente en el 73.º Regimiento de Fusileros, cruzó la frontera de Luxemburgo a finales de 1914 y, poco después, entró en combate. Desde entonces, y casi a diario, relató en quince cuadernos su participación en una contienda que diezmó a una generación entera. Pronto encuentra el infierno: poblaciones arrasadas, heridos abandonados a su suerte, compañeros desventrados; una verdadera máquina de devastación. También describe la dureza de la vida en las trincheras, el peligro de las incursiones nocturnas para capturar prisioneros o las ocasiones en que escapa de la muerte, agazapado en el cráter de un obús.Acompañados por los numerosos dibujos realizados por el propio autor, y por mapas y esquemas de las zonas de combate mencionadas, estos diarios describen la atroz realidad con crudeza y autenticidad, a veces con la fría curiosidad de un entomólogo, al tiempo que nos descubren a un Jünger muchas veces harto de la guerra y de la incompetencia de sus superiores, pero también orgulloso de las heridas que recibió y de las condecoraciones obtenidas, como la prestigiosa Pour le Mérite.Anotado y comentado por Helmuth Kiesel, profesor de literatura alemana y experto en la obra de Jünger, Diario de Guerra (1914-1918) permaneció inédito hasta 2010, y su publicación en Alemania constituyó un auténtico acontecimiento editorial.",Spanish,Spanish,Hardcover,,672 pages,"

","An irresistible reimagining of the Robin Hood legend, Maid Marian brings to life the rollicking—and romantic—world of the Middle Ages.An orphan and heiress to a large country estate, Marian Fitzwater is wed at the age of five to an equally young nobleman, Lord Hugh of Sencaster, a union that joins her inheritance to his. But when she is seventeen, Lord Hugh, whom she hasn’t seen in years, dies under mysterious circumstances. Marian is left alone again—a widow who has never been a bride. But now, like all unmarried young ladies of fortune, she is made the ward of King Richard the Lionheart. Since Richard is away on Crusade, Marian’s fate lies in the hands of his mother, the formidable Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. The bridegroom Eleanor selects will get Marian’s lands and, in return, pledge his loyalty—and silver—to the king. Marian herself is irrelevant and she knows it. Determined not to be sold into another sham marriage, she seeks out the one man who can help uncover the queen’s intentions: Robin Hood, the notorious Saxon outlaw of Sherwood Forest.Marian is surprised to discover that the famed “prince of thieves” is not only helpful but handsome, likeable, and sympathetic to her plight. Robin’s men intercept a letter from Queen Eleanor, from which Marian learns, to her horror, that she is to marry her late husband’s brother. His family has a history of mysterious deaths, and Marian knows she is in danger. Once married, she can be easily disposed of—a fate she may have escaped once already. On the eve of her wedding, Robin Hood spirits Marian back to the forest. The Queen believes her to be dead, and Marian begins a new life with Robin Hood’s outlaws, who pledge to help her regain her fortune and expose the treachery of her enemies.",1400082765,9781400082766),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","On the evening of June 12, 1963—the day President John F. Kennedy gave his most impassioned speech about the need for interracial tolerance —Medgar Evers, the NAACP's first field secretary in Mississippi, was shot and killed by an assassin's bullet in his driveway. The still-smoking gun—bearing the fingerprints of Byron De La Beckwith, a staunch white supremacist—was recovered moments later in some nearby bushes. Still, Beckwith remained free for over thirty years, until Evers's widow finally forced the Mississippi courts to bring him to justice. The Autobiography of Medgar Evers tells the full story of one the greatest leaders of the civil rights movement, bringing his achievement to life for a new generation. Although Evers's memory has remained a force in the civil rights movement, the legal battles surrounding his death have too often overshadowed the example and inspiration of his life.Myrlie Evers-Williams and Manning Marable have assembled the previously untouched cache of Medgar's personal documents, writings, and speeches. These remarkable pieces range from Medgar's monthly reports to the NAACP to his correspondence with luminaries of the time such as Robert Carter, General Counsel for the NAACP in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case. Most important of all are the recollections of Myrlie Evers, combined with letters from her personal collection. These documents and memories form the backbone of The Autobiography of Medgar Evers — a cohesive narrative detailing the rise and tragic death of a civil rights hero.",0465021778,9780465021772),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

And yet his failed marriage to Reese Nicholson has haunted him for ten long years. Now that he has moved back to Cape Cod Bay to help run his family’s resort, he is surrounded by memories of Reese…and he can’t stop longing for the woman he’d always believed was his one true love. At nineteen, artist Reese Nicholson was swept off her feet by the handsome, charming, and incredibly sensual Trent Rockwell. After a whirlwind courtship, they married and moved to New York City, where they hoped all of their personal and professional dreams would come true. But six months later, Reese returned to Rockwell Island brokenhearted and disillusioned. For a decade, Trent and Reese carefully kept their distance. But all it takes is one accidental late-night encounter to immediately stir the desires they have both tried to bury deep. Powerless to resist the heat between them, every passionate kiss, loving caress, and heartfelt apology draws them closer together. So close that they can’t help but wonder if the promises they once made to love each other forever are still true…",9780986135811,9780986135811,ebook,,300 pages,"

","The “brilliant” and “daringly original” (The New York Times) critique of digital networks from the “David Foster Wallace of tech” (London Evening Standard)—asserting that to fix our economy, we must fix our information economy.Jaron Lanier is the father of virtual reality and one of the world’s most brilliant thinkers. Who Owns the Future? is his visionary reckoning with the most urgent economic and social trend of our age: the poisonous concentration of money and power in our digital networks.Lanier has predicted how technology will transform our humanity for decades, and his insight has never been more urgently needed. He shows how Siren Servers, which exploit big data and the free sharing of information, led our economy into recession, imperiled personal privacy, and hollowed out the middle class. The networks that define our world—including social media, financial institutions, and intelligence agencies—now threaten to destroy it.But there is an alternative. In this provocative, poetic, and deeply humane book, Lanier charts a path toward a brighter future: an information economy that rewards ordinary people for what they do and share on the web.",1451654967,9781451654967),Hardcover,US,367 pages,"

","""Осъдени души"" е колкото личен роман на една англичанка и един испански монах, толкова и роман на широки обществени отношения. Личният роман е вплетен в голямата борба на испанския народ срещу силите на реакцията - за свободата и за републиката.Без да си поставя за задача цялостното изображение на тая борба, Димов я засяга както в нейните широки исторически, социално-икономически и идейни причини, така и в редица нейни конкретни прояви, особено във втората част на романа, когато избухва бунтът на монархистите. За автора има две Испании - традиционната Испания на аристократите, католическото духовенство, реакцията и нова Испания - на републиката, работниците, борците за свобода и социални реформи. Димов се старае да нарисува тия две Испании - чрез поражението на отделни лица, чрез очертаване на големите линии на Испанската гражданска война, чрез конкретни прояви на кървавата борба между стара, умираща и нова, възраждаща се Испания и най-сетне чрез многобройни анализи на испанския характер и испанския живот в миналото и настоящето.Интересен е похватът на Димов - първата част на романа ""Краят на едно приключение"" ни поставя във Франкова Испания на реакцията, за да ни въведе по-късно във втората и третата част в борческа Испания на републиката и гражданската война. Естествено тая съпоставка - по пътя на контраста - води до по-релефни очертания. Същият похват е използван и при изображението на главната героиня: в първата част на романа тя е дадена в крайната, последната фаза на своето развитие, за да бъде показана и проследена във втората и третата част историята на това развитие.",9547350153,9547350153,Paperback,,300 pages,"

","By 1873, long since the Golden Age of pirates and swashbuckling adventure, the oceans, it's said, were tamed, at least that's what young French orphan girl Chanel Angeli thought when she settled down and married into a rich mining family by means of their charming, gorgeous heir Oliver Aubry. Until, that is, Oliver accepts a business proposition from his old mentor Lord Beaumont, who has begun excavating an island in the Azores Archipelago that holds many mysterious and deadly secrets. When Beaumont betrays and enslaves Oliver on the isolated piece of land, which is thought to be capitol city of Atlantis, Chanel escapes and teams up with the devil-may-care captain of the Margeaux, endeavoring to rescue her husband, but along the way she finds, within herself, uncovering many mysteries of her own...",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,422 pages,"

An archaeologist who unearths a mysterious artifact, an airman who finds himself far from home, a painter, a ghost, a vampire, and a Viking: the seven stories in this compelling novel all take place on the remote Scandinavian island of Blessed where a curiously powerful plant that resembles a dragon grows. What binds these stories together? What secrets lurk beneath the surface of this idyllic countryside? And what might be powerful enough to break the cycle of midwinterblood?

Not widely understood, or told before in the West but at the roots of the current conflicts. The narrative grips the reader with its honesty, brutality and beauty. The author describes his own journey, reflections and life stories told to him whilst he was held without trial for 14 years, as a political prisoner in several prisons. These included Palmyra, noted by Amnesty International as one of the most oppressive prisons in the world.The work is an enthralling and informative mosaic reflecting the colours, sects, religions, politics, legends and geography of the Levant. The journey spans the areas deserts, coastline, mountains and forests. It speaks of family, friendship, love, hope, fear, torture, hiding and escaping.

","The spiritual classic by à Kempis, the second most widely read spiritual book after the Bible, has had an astonishing impact on the spiritual lives of countless saints, peasants, and popes for centuries. Even today, the soul-searching words of the fifteenth-century cleric Thomas à Kempis continue to resonate, unbounded by time or geography. Drawing on the Bible, the Fathers of the early Church and medieval mysticism, his four-part treatise shrugs off the allure of the material world, blending beauty and bluntness in a supremely spiritual call-to-arms.This beautiful translation by Ronald Knox and Michael Oakley is considered by many teachers, writers, and readers to be the best English translation ever, and one that greatly enhances the life-changing insights of Thomas à Kempis. Illustrated.""If we could construct a composite picture of all great Christians—Catholic or non-Catholic—of the last five hundred years who found The Imitation substantially beneficial, enlightening, and inspiring, we would need no further proof that familiarity with this great classic is an integral part of a mature spiritual life and even a path to holiness."" —Father Benedict J.

For 38 years, she has broken records, winning more games than any NCAA team in basketball history. She has coached an undefeated season, co-captained the first women's Olympic team, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and has been named Sports Illustrated 'Sportswoman of the Year'.She owes her coaching success to her personal struggles and triumphs. She learned to be tough from her strict, demanding father. Motherhood taught her to balance that rigidity with communication and kindness. She is a role model for the many women she's coached; 74 of her players have become coaches.Pat's life took a shocking turn in 2011, when she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, an irreversible brain condition that affects 5 million Americans. Despite her devastating diagnosis, she led the Vols to win their sixteenth SEC championship in March 2012.

","1984, Tokyo. Aomame è bloccata in un taxi nel traffico. L'autista le suggerisce, come unica soluzione per non mancare all'appuntamento che l'aspetta, di uscire dalla tangenziale utilizzando una scala di emergenza, nascosta e poco frequentata. Ma, sibillino, aggiunge di fare attenzione: «Non si lasci ingannare dalle apparenze. La realtà è sempre una sola». Negli stessi giorni Tengo, un giovane aspirante scrittore dotato di buona tecnica ma povero d'ispirazione, riceve uno strano incarico: un editor senza scrupoli gli chiede di riscrivere il romanzo di un'enigmatica diciassettenne così da candidarlo a un famoso premio letterario. Ma La crisalide d'aria è un romanzo fantastico - o almeno così dovrebbe essere - tanto ricco di immaginazione quanto sottilmente inquietante: la descrizione della realtà parallela alla nostra e di piccole creature che si nascondono nel corpo umano come parassiti turbano profondamente Tengo. L'incontro con l'autrice non farà che aumentare la sua vertigine: chi è veramente Fukada Eriko?Intanto Aomame (che pure non è certo una ragazza qualsiasi: nella borsetta ha un affilatissimo rompighiaccio con cui deve uccidere un uomo) osserva perplessa il mondo che la circonda: sembra quello di sempre, eppure piccoli, sinistri particolari divergono da quello a cui era abituata. Finché un giorno non vede comparire in cielo una seconda luna e sospetta di essere l'unica persona in grado di attraversare la sottile barriera che divide il 1984 dal 1Q84.Ma capisce anche un'altra cosa: che quella barriera sta per infrangersi.""1Q84"" è stato accolto, alla sua uscita in Giappone, come il capolavoro di Murakami Haruki e immediatamente elevato a oggetto di un autentico culto, tanto che sono comparsi libri e riviste che provano a indagare i misteri e rispondere agli interrogativi che solleva questo romanzo fluviale, ricco di storie (e storie dentro storie), personaggi, idee.Un Murakami al suo meglio che riesce come non mai a centrifugare le suggestioni più diverse (dal folklore giapponese all'immaginario manga, dalla fantascienza occidentale alla tradizione letteraria orientale) e a esplorare le nostre ossessioni per dare vita a un mondo del tutto personale, onirico e malinconico, in cui nessuna realtà parallela ripaga per la nostalgia di un'amicizia d'infanzia, per un amore mancato.",8806203797,9788806203795),Hardcover,Supercoralli,722 pages,"

No more being the brunt of every joke. No more ""Deweyitis.""

Through their friendship, Dewey gains awareness of issues bigger than himself and bigger than his small town of Sand Mountain: issues like race and segregation, the reality of the Vietnam War, abuse, sexuality, and even death and grieving.

Yet the more Kate entwines herself with the Andersons—graceful mother Jo, renowned journalist father Neal, watchful younger sister Delphine—the more she is convinced that not everything is as it seems.

","The novel is the story of three generations of women, Agnes, a grandmother who as a young woman went to China as a Canadian missionary nurse and who falls in love with a Chinese doctor who acts as her interpreter. Shortly after anti-western sentiment sends her home in a hurry she discovers she is pregnant by him. Attempts by her, and later their daughter, to contact him fail. Her daughter, Meihua, goes to China to look for her father and ends up marrying a Chinese man and teaching art. The Cultural Revolution sees her sent to prison as a American spy suspect and anti-revolutionary, and her husband confined to a gulag. Their children, still at home, are raised by the family's illiterate servant, Yao. Yao's crude manner and resourcefulness partly shield Yezi, Meihua's daughter, and the novel's main character, from family tragedy, poverty and political discrimination, negotiating their survival during the revolution that she barely understands. Only after her mother released, does Yezi hear about her foreign grandmother, Agnes, who lives in Boston and has lost contact with the family since Yezi's birth. Curious about her American ancestry, Yezi now a teenager, joins Agnes in the U.S. Reading her grandmother's diaries helps Yezi get to know her grandmother as a young Canadian missionary and her life in China with the man who is her grandfather, and who her mother longed to find.",English,English,Paperback,,270 pages,"

","Vesper is a scientific-minded young woman living in the kingdom of Malland. When she finds a detached talking penis in the woods, her sheltered life with its wistful fantasies of change explodes into chaos as the penis chases her home, wrecks her sister’s engagement party, and causes a scandal so costly that it results in Vesper’s forced engagement to a wart-faced widower who agrees to pay her family’s debt.Vesper flees her engagement, hoping for a reward when she returns the penis to his owner—the royal prince, no less. But she discovers that the penis isn’t the only talking body part flying around the kingdom. People everywhere are falling victim to a magical disease that causes body parts to fall off and animate, and Vesper finds herself fighting an evil plot to create an army of body parts and a society of denial and control, one that deals with all problems by severing them.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,322 pages,"

","Cosmically fast-paced and wildly imaginative, this debut novel is a perfect potion of magic and suspense Once a city of enormous wealth and culture, Prague was home to emperors, alchemists, astronomers, and, as it’s whispered, hell portals. When music student Sarah Weston lands a summer job at Prague Castle cataloging Beethoven’s manuscripts, she has no idea how dangerous her life is about to become. Prague is a threshold, Sarah is warned, and it is steeped in blood.      Soon after Sarah arrives, strange things begin to happen. She learns that her mentor, who was working at the castle, may not have committed suicide after all. Could his cryptic notes be warnings? As Sarah parses his clues about Beethoven’s “Immortal Beloved,” she manages to get arrested, to have tantric sex in a public fountain, and to discover a time-warping drug. She also catches the attention of a four-hundred-year-old dwarf, the handsome Prince Max, and a powerful U.S. senator with secrets she will do anything to hide.      City of Dark Magic could be called a rom-com paranormal suspense novel—or it could simply be called one of the most entertaining novels of the year.",English,English,Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Winner of the 2007 Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award!Samuel Adams is perhaps the most unheralded and overshadowed of the founding fathers, yet without him there would have been no American Revolution. A genius at devising civil protests and political maneuvers that became a trademark of American politics, Adams astutely forced Britain into coercive military measures that ultimately led to the irreversible split in the empire. His remarkable political career addresses all the major issues concerning America's decision to become a nation -- from the notion of taxation without representation to the Declaration of Independence. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams all acknowledged that they built our nation on Samuel Adams' foundations. Now, in this riveting biography, his story is finally told and his crucial place in American history is fully recognized.",1403975825,9781403975829),Hardcover,,273 pages,"

But Lex's luck is about to run out because the Goddess of Fortune has selected him to be her player in the highly dangerous Games. Losing is not an option for Lex (particularly as it so often involves dying) but can he really win each of the perilous rounds? Given that the reward for doing so is money, fame and glory - all things that Lex is quite keen on - he's going to do whatever it takes to make sure he will... and he's certainly got good experience of cheating.",0755355180,9780755355181),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","In 1933, at the age of 18, Patrick Leigh Fermor set out on an extraordinary journey by foot - from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople. A Time of Gifts is the first volume in a trilogy recounting the trip, and takes the reader with him as far as Hungary. It is a book of compelling glimpses - not only of the events which were curdling Europe at that time, but also of its resplendent domes and monasteries, its great rivers, the sun on the Bavarian snow, the storks and frogs, the hospitable burgomasters who welcomed him, and that world's grandeurs and courtesies. His powers of recollection have astonishing sweep and verve, and the scope is majestic. First published to enormous acclaim, it confirmed Fermor's reputation as the greatest living travel writer, and has, together with its sequel Between the Woods and the Water (the third volume is famously yet to be published), been a perennial seller for 25 years.",1590171659,9781590171653),Paperback,,321 pages,"

She’s a con artist, a master of disguise, and a sophomore at Chicago’s swanky St. Agatha High, where her father, an old-school grifter with a weakness for the ponies, sends her to so she can learn to mingle with the upper crust. For extra spending money Julep doesn’t rely on her dad—she runs petty scams for her classmates while dodging the dean of students and maintaining an A+ (okay, A-) average.But when she comes home one day to a ransacked apartment and her father gone, Julep’s carefully laid plans for an expenses-paid golden ticket to Yale start to unravel. Even with help from St. Agatha’s resident Prince Charming, Tyler Richland, and her loyal hacker sidekick, Sam, Julep struggles to trace her dad’s trail of clues through a maze of creepy stalkers, hit attempts, family secrets, and worse, the threat of foster care. With everything she has at stake, Julep’s in way over her head . . . but that’s not going to stop her from using every trick in the book to find her dad before his mark finds her. Because that would be criminal.Fans of Ally Carter, especially her Heist Society readers, will love this teen mystery/thriller with sarcastic wit, a hint of romance, and Ocean’s Eleven–inspired action.",0385744064,9780385744065),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

They beat the system as best they can with the various inside hustles of New York’s bar and restaurant scene.Charlie, managing a Village restaurant at age thirty-five, needs one shot to realize his dreams of owning his own place in New England. Meanwhile, he’s just a jump ahead of two shylocks and into the worst streak of losing horses he has ever gone through.Paulie is only a five-foot-three-inch waiter but he thinks big. Very image-conscious, he even tips toll booth attendants. And he went into hock to become part-owner of a “turrow bed” racehorse. Now he has an idea for one foolproof burglary that will solve all his problems for good, and he enlists Charlie in his scheme.The third member of the team is Barney. A semi-retired Irish safecracker from the Bronx, Barney has a retarded son as is willing to take one last gamble to provide for his future. A clean break-in, a three-way split, and each of their dreams will come true.Maybe. Before it’s over, they find themselves relentlessly hunted by both the Mafia “wise guys” and the police. And each of them grasps for survival in a different way.Acutely realistic yet wondrously funny, The Pope of Greenwich Village captures the speech, the scams, the flavor, the dread, and the humor of ordinary people scrambling to make it big in a neighborhood that prides itself on creating and enforcing its own laws.

Na prvi pogled čitaoca može zbuni-ti nedefinisana forma iskaza. jer se radi o nesortiranim mislima nastalim kao statusi po društvenim mrežama. Uglavnom se radi o aforizmima, donekle složenim u smi-slenu celinu, ali ima tu i nekoliko poetskih momenata, pa i nekoliko priča. Niko tu nije pošteđen, ni prijatelji, niti ljubavnice bi-vše i buduće, o vladajućoj nomenklaturi da i ne pričam... Čak je i Deda Mraz dobio svoje u jednoj od Janićevih satiričnih tirada.Najsažetiji smisao i ideja ove knjige nalazi se u kreščendu, možda najsjajnije tačke ove zbirke, priče “Zdravo snovi, zbogom”:“Samo, zašto ja ne znam koji je danas datum…?Samo, zašto ja ne znam gde se nalazim…?Samo, zašto ja sada, u stvari, nisam više ja?!” Stevan Šarčević",Serbian,Serbian,Paperback,,86 pages,"

","Sam Dryden, retired special forces, lives a quiet life in a small town on the coast of Southern California. While out on a run in the middle of the night, a young girl runs into him on the seaside boardwalk. Barefoot and terrified, she’s running from a group of heavily armed men with one clear goal—to kill the fleeing child. After Dryden helps her evade her pursuers, he learns that the eleven year old, for as long as she can remember, has been kept in a secret prison by forces within the government. But she doesn’t know much beyond her own name, Rachel. She only remembers the past two months of her life—and that she has a skill that makes her very dangerous to these men and the hidden men in charge.Dryden, who lost his wife and young daughter in an accident five years ago, agrees to help her try to unravel her own past and make sense of it, to protect her from the people who are moving heaven and earth to find them both. Although Dryden is only one man, he’s a man with the extraordinary skills and experience—as a Ranger, a Delta, and five years doing off-the-book black ops with an elite team. But, as he slowly begins to discover, the highly trained paramilitary forces on their heels is the only part of the danger they must face. Will Rachel’s own unremembered past be the most deadly of them all?",3499268027,9783499268021),Paperback,,432 pages,"

É sobretudo uma aventura com a linguagem: além de fundar a narrativa, a linguagem é também o instrumento que, com seu rigor, desorganiza um outro rigor, o das verdades pensadas como irremovíveis.

","Updated with maps, photographs, and battlefield diagrams, this special fiftieth anniversary edition of the classic history of the Korean War is a dramatic and hard-hitting account of the conflict written from the perspective of those who fought it. Partly drawn from official records, operations journals, and histories, it is based largely on the compelling personal narratives of the small-unit commanders and their troops. Unlike any other work on the Korean War, it provides both a clear panoramic overview and a sharply drawn ""you were there"" account of American troops in fierce combat against the North Korean and Chinese communist invaders. As Americans and North Koreans continue to face each other across the 38th Parallel, This Kind of War commemorates the past and offers vital lessons for the future.",1574883348,9781574883343),Paperback,50th Anniversary Edition,540 pages,"

Mrs. Sucksby’s household, with its fussy babies calmed with doses of gin, also hosts a transient family of petty thieves—fingersmiths—for whom this house in the heart of a mean London slum is home. One day, the most beloved thief of all arrives—Gentleman, an elegant con man, who carries with him an enticing proposition for Sue: If she wins a position as the maid to Maud Lilly, a naïve gentlewoman, and aids Gentleman in her seduction, then they will all share in Maud’s vast inheritance. Once the inheritance is secured, Maud will be disposed of—passed off as mad, and made to live out the rest of her days in a lunatic asylum. With dreams of paying back the kindness of her adopted family, Sue agrees to the plan. Once in, however, Sue begins to pity her helpless mark and care for Maud Lilly in unexpected ways...But no one and nothing is as it seems in this Dickensian novel of thrills and reversals.",B0026NBZDU,B0026NBZDU,Kindle Edition,,560 pages,"

You should choose every syllable carefully, because you never know when somebody will hold you to your word.  Somebody like me.  I'm not a good man. I'm not. I know. I have enough darkness inside of me to rid the world of every stitch of light. But there's one I could never harm, one light I couldn't bring myself to snuff out.  Karissa.  She thinks I'm a monster, and maybe I am. I taunt her with my touch, get a thrill out of torturing her soul. But I'm not the only one. The world is full of monsters, and I'm not the most dangerous one out there.  Not even close…  God help me, I love her.  I do.  And God help anybody who tries to take her from me.

","Longlisted – Baileys Women’s Prize 2014Man Booker Prize, Fiction, 2013Canadian Governor General's Literary Award, 2013.It is 1866 and Walter Moody has come to make his fortune upon the New Zealand goldfields. On arrival, he stumbles across a tense gathering of 12 local men, who have met in secret to discuss a series of unsolved crimes. A wealthy man has vanished, a whore has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Moody is soon drawn into the mystery: a network of fates and fortunes that is as complex and exquisitely patterned as the night sky.The Luminaries is an extraordinary piece of fiction. Written in pitch-perfect historical register, richly evoking a mid-19th-century world of shipping and banking and goldrush boom and bust, it is also a ghost story, and a gripping mystery. It is a thrilling achievement for someone still in her mid-20s, and will confirm for critics and listeners that Catton is one of the brightest stars in the international writing firmament.Eleanor Catton was born in 1985 in Canada and raised in New Zealand. She completed an MA in Creative Writing at Victoria University in 2007 and won the Adam Prize in Creative Writing for The Rehearsal.

","Émile ZOLA (1840-1902), né à Paris, de père italien, un ingénieur de travaux publics, et mère française. À conséquence du décès du chef de famille, l´orphelin, fils unique, et la veuve, connaissent des graves pénuries économiques, jusqu´à ce que le jeune Émile entre en contact avec Louis Hachette, qui l'embauche comme commis dans sa librairie le 1er mars 1862. Il considère dès son plus jeune âge l'écriture comme sa véritable vocation. Ses amis d'enfance Paul Cézanne et Jean-Baptistin Baille sont ses premiers lecteurs. Zola est considéré le chef de files de l´école naturaliste française. Il avait été influencé par les théories contemporaines de l´hérédité et la science expérimentale. Le premier volume, « La Fortune des Rougon », de son œuvre principale, « Les Rougon-Macquart », est présentée comme une « histoire naturelle et social d´une famille sous les Second Empire ». Le résultat est un panorama du style de vie français, particulièrement de la classe moyenne et ouvrière, pendant le XIXe siècle, fait avec une documentation rigoureuse et systématique et focalisé sur le vice, la misère, les instincts et les appétits humains.  « Au Bonheur des Dames » (1883). Onzième volume de la série « Les Rougon-Macquart ». Le roman parle du grand commerce dans Paris, particulièrement des grands bazars modernes. La protagoniste, Denise Baudu, est employée au Bonheur des Dames et assiste au développement fulgurant de ce magasin et à la ruine des petits commerces. Zola voit dans l'éclosion des grands magasins une mutation de la société, le «triomphe de l'activité moderne», le produit d'un « siècle en mouvement ».

","Published more than 30 years ago, Veena Gavankar’s biography of African-American scientist and agriculturist George Washington Carver, has remained one of the bestsellers in Marathi literature even today.A gripping story about a man and his determination to succeed amidst hardship and hurdles, the book not only captures the essence of perseverance, but also beautifully portrays how the desire and a thirst for knowledge indeed, does lead to greatness.Dubbed by the Times magazine in 1941 as the “Black Leonardo”, Carver’s contributions to the fields of botany and agriculture are immense. His courage and conviction, to get an education in spite of growing up in a society ridden with prejudice and reeking with the aftermath of the apartheid, is astutely covered by the author.Short, simple and neatly written, Gavankar has touched every aspect of the life and struggles of Carver, his achievements and his many talents. Known as the Peanut Man in America and all around the world today, Carver is said to be the man behind the development of the quintessential American spread, the peanut butter. His message - about persevering in the face of adversity and making something out of whatever one has in life - is simply but clearly depicted, and this biography has served as an inspiration to hundreds of Indians all over the country.Ek Hota Carver, which began as a result of a mother’s search for bedtime stories for her children, has been on the best-selling Marathi literature for over 30 years, from the time it was first published. Soon to be available as an audiobook, Ek Hota Carver has also had the distinction of being run into 34 editions.",8174340475,9788174340474),Paperback,Deluxe edition,184 pages,"

","Love, the most intriguing, mystical and vibrant emotion ever experienced by humans. Nevertheless, it is also the most complex and yet to be understood emotion. Ask anyone what love is? And the most common answer you would get is, 'it is a feeling which cannot be completely defined'. Strange but true. An emotion which in the history of mankind has changed destinies and shaped millions of lives is still not fully comprehended. But, if you ask this question to 'Rishi Sinha' the only answer you will get is 'Ananya Tripathi'. Life has completely changed since the day he confessed his love for her. Romantic dates, late night phone calls and never ending SMS's. A 'happy go lucky couple', madly and completely in love. Everything was going on smooth until one day, when Rishi is put into a National Level competition with 'Pragya'… his screwed up past and the biggest mistake of his life. He has no choice but to represent his college with Pragya and of course win the title too. Rishi tells Ananya about the competition, who, like a mature girl understands his condition and has no objection in his working with her. But, fate has something else in store for him. Now Rishi is in a dilemma. On one side is 'Ananya', the love of his life and on the other side is 'Pragya', a dying and needy friend. On one side is his most ruined past, while on the other his present, his future. He has to choose between the two. Whom will he choose? 'One Life, One Love' is a tale of 'Love' and 'Friendship' along with some social issues like 'Prostitution', 'Mafia', 'Live in' and 'Gambling' which we talk and read about daily but never realise how intense they are. Will Rishi be able to take the right decision and save his relationship? What has Rishi's fate in store for him? All your answers lie here, in this emotional yet witty tale by Rochak Bhatnagar… Take a plunge...  *********************************** About the author: Rochak Bhatnagar is the bestselling author of 'Love Happens Only Once'.

Alles is zwart en donker en de mensen zijn veranderd in Onderworpenen; willoze wezens met rode ogen en vleugels. Gelukkig zijn Sofia en de vijf andere Draconianen onveranderd. Zij zijn nog veilig, maar de beschermingskracht neemt af. De Onderworpenen staan hen naar het leven. Onder leiding van Sofia gaan de Draconianen op zoek naar fragmenten van de laatste vrucht. Als ze die hebben, kunnen ze Nidhoggr overwinnen. Sofia zoekt samen met Fabio en hun verliefdheid krijgt daardoor een nieuwe kans. Vanaf de eerste pagina wordt de lezer meegezogen in de strijd tussen goed en kwaad. Vernuftige trucjes en drakenkracht houden de Onderworpenen op afstand. Het verhaal speelt in Italië en bevat veel informatie over Italiaanse dorpen en eten.

","Der beliebteste deutsche Nachrichtenmoderator eröffnet die Debatte über die Neuverteilung der WeltDer Klimawandel verändert bereits jetzt das Antlitz unseres Planeten massiv. Davon ist »heute journal«-Moderator Claus Kleber überzeugt. Auf der Basis langjähriger Recherchen und aktueller Eindrücke an klimapolitisch brisanten Hotspots skizziert er zusammen mit seiner Koautorin Cleo Paskal die Herausforderungen des 21. Jahrhunderts – mit ihren Siegern und Verlierern. Extreme Wetterereignisse konfrontieren die komplexen Gesellschaften und ihre hochsensiblen Infrastrukturen mit dramatischen Einbrüchen. Eine eisfreie Arktis eröffnet dem Kampf um Ressourcen neue Dimensionen. So verschieben sich Machtverhältnisse infolge des Klimawandels tiefgreifend. Dass China im Rennen um eine weltweite Vormachtstellung die Poleposition besetzt, belegt Claus Kleber anhand von Indizien, die er rund um den Globus gefunden hat. Sein Buch beschreibt Entwicklungen, die erschrecken, mit denen wir uns aber jetzt auseinandersetzen müssen.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,320 pages,"

","C'est un obscur fonctionnaire de Montignac, en Dordogne - Eugène Le Roy -, qui réalisera, vingt ans après la mort de Michelet, le voeu célèbre de l'historien d'écrire un livre populaire : un livre qui s'adresse au peuple, lui raconte son histoire, exprime sa révolte à l'égard des puissants qui l'oppriment et son inquiétude face à la disparition du monde rural et des modes de vie traditionnels. Dans une œuvre à la fois naïve et colorée, sombre et cruelle, Le Roy met la fiction au service de la mémoire collective. Il offre, en même temps qu'un document sur la vie rurale - symbole de toutes les souffrances paysannes dans le bas Périgord au début du XIXe siècle -, un roman d'aventures militant, dans lequel le discours sur la France de cette époque double en permanence le récit d'une révolte paysanne sous la Restauration ; un conte auquel ne manquent ni les loups ni les sorcières, mais un conte politique, animé par la revendication de justice sociale et traversé par le souffle immense de l'épopée révolutionnaire.",2355690243,9782355690242),,,468 pages,"

","From the internationally acclaimed, bestselling author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, an unexpected and enchanting novel—the culmination of his life's work.Casting light on the most serious of problems, and at the same time saying not one serious sentence; being fascinated by the reality of the contemporary world, and at the same time completely avoiding realism—that’s The Festival of Insignificance. Readers who know Milan Kundera’s earlier books know that the wish to incorporate an element of the “unserious” in a novel is not at all unexpected of him. In Immortality, Goethe and Hemingway stroll through several chapters together talking and laughing. And in Slowness, Vera, the author’s wife, says to her husband: “you’ve often told me you meant to write a book one day that would have not a single serious word in it…I warn you: watch out. Your enemies are lying in wait.”Now, far from watching out, Kundera is finally and fully realizing his old aesthetic dream in this novel that we could easily view as a summation of his whole work. A strange sort of summation. Strange sort of epilogue. Strange sort of laughter, inspired by our time, which is comical because it has lost all sense of humor. What more can we say? Nothing.

There are no limits to his brutality, no lines drawn in the sand. The club is his life, and he’ll do whatever it takes to keep his brothers safe.  He’s a man who keeps to himself, guarding the walls that he secured so long ago. Then, one moment, one chance meeting, changes everything.  Wren Life for Wren and her son, Wyatt, isn’t exactly easy. Yet, Wren faces each day with determination and courage. Wyatt is her joy and motivation; for him, she will find a way to make their lives better, even when obstacles are continually thrown in her path. The last thing she needs is another complication, but what is life without complications?  Stitch appears when they need him the most, protecting them when no one else can. Wren can’t understand it. She should feel threatened by his bulging muscles and menacing tattoos, but she’s somehow able to see past the mysterious biker to the man inside. She is drawn to him for reasons she can’t even begin to comprehend. All she knows is that her body craves his touch.  Can Stitch let his guard down and allow these two strangers into his heart? Can Wren see beyond the scars of her past long enough to let him in, or will her fear drive him away?  ** This book is intended for readers 18 years or older due to bad language, violence, and explicit sex scenes.

","The true story of Max Butler, the master hacker who ran a billion dollar cyber crime network.The word spread through the hacking underground like some unstoppable new virus: an audacious crook had staged a hostile takeover of an online criminal network that siphoned billions of dollars from the US economy.The culprit was a brilliant programmer with a hippie ethic and a supervillain's double identity. Max 'Vision' Butler was a white-hat hacker and a celebrity throughout the programming world, even serving as a consultant to the FBI. But there was another side to Max. As the black-hat 'Iceman', he'd seen the fraudsters around him squabble, their ranks riddled with infiltrators, their methods inefficient, and in their dysfunction was the ultimate challenge: he would stage a coup and steal their ill-gotten gains from right under their noses.Through the story of Max Butler's remarkable rise, KINGPIN lays bare the workings of a silent crime wave affecting millions worldwide. It exposes vast online-fraud supermarkets stocked with credit card numbers, counterfeit cheques, hacked bank accounts and fake passports. Thanks to Kevin Poulsen's remarkable access to both cops and criminals, we step inside the quiet,desperate battle that law enforcement fights against these scammers.

Each jacket comes with a detachable bookmark.Increasingly disillusioned by the rejection slips that studded the walls of his room and his on/off engagement to Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald began his third revision of the novel that was to become This Side of Paradise.

","كتاب الام من مفاخر المسلمين، فهو موسوعة ضخمة شملت الفروع والأصول واللغة والتفسير والحديث، كما أنه حوى بين دفتيه عدداً هائلاً من الأحاديث والآثار وفقه السلف الصالح - رحمهم الله -.كما يُعدّ خلاصةَ وقمةَ الإنتاج العلمي للإمام الشافعي, فهو يجمع ما انتهى إليه فقهُه، وهو من آخر مؤلّفاته الفقهية، أملاه على تلاميذه في مصر في أواخر حياته، كما أنه يمثل القول الجديد الذي استقر عليه مذهبه، ويعبر عن المسائل التي فيها بأنها مذهب الشافعي الجديد.وقد قام البويطيّ تلميذُ الإمام الشافعي بجمعه دون أن يذكر اسمه فيه، ولا نسبه إلى نفسه, بل نُسِب إلى راويه الربيع بن سليمان المرادي (174-270ﻫ) تلميذ الإمام الشافعي أيضاً، والذي بوبه ورتبه وهذبه.قال الحافظ أبو الحسين محمد بن عبد الله بن جعفر الرازي المتوفى سنة 347ﻫ، وهو والد الحافظ تمام الرازي: كان البويطي يقول: الربيع أثبت في الشافعي مني. التهذيب للحافظ ابن حجر (3: 246).مميزات كتاب الأم:1- كثرة الاستدلال فيه والاحتجاج بالنصوص الشرعية، وقد زادت الآثار فيه على أربعة آلاف مما يعني أنه من الكتب المسندة المهمة خاصة مع تقدم وفاة الشافعي وأخذه عن إمامي الحجاز مالك وسفيان.2-	احتكام مؤلفه كثيراً إلى اللغة في فهم النصوص وتفسيرها.3-	المزج فيه بين الفقه والأصول والقواعد والضوابط والفروق الفقهية.4-	اشتماله على المناظرات والنقاشات العلمية الدقيقة التي تربي الملكة وتصقل الموهبة.5-	أحد المصادر المهمة التي حفظت لنا آراء بعض الفقهاء من معاصري الشافعي، كابن أبي ليلى والأوزاعي.6-	أحد أهم المصادر في الفقه المقارن، كما أنه مصدر أساسي في تقرير المذهب الشافعي.7-	يعد من الكتب المجاميع، فقد احتوى على عدد من الكتب في الأصول والحديث والفقه.ومؤلف هذا الكتاب هو الإمام محمد بن إدريس الشافعي، أحد الأئمة الأربعة الأعلام، المولود في غزة بفلسطين سنة 150ﻫ، وحُمِل منها إلى مكة وهو ابن سنتين، وزار بغدادَ مرّتين، وقصد مصرَ سنة 199ﻫ فتوفي بها سنة 204ﻫ، وقبره معروف في القاهرة.بيانات الطبعة الأصلية: طبع هذا الكتاب عن الطبعة الأصلية المعتمدة والمطبوعة في المطبعة الكبرى الأميرية ببولاق مصر المحمية سنة 1321ﻫ بمراجعة وتصحيح الشيخ نصر بن محمد العادلي والشيخ محمد بن محمد البلبيسي، وعناية والتزام العلامة أحمد بن أحمد الحسيني (ت: 1332ﻫ).http://www.daralnawader.com/books/boo...",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,2112 pages,"

","   Adrian Masters journeys into the wilderness of Starlight, the dragon planet, in search of his brother Frederick who has built a refuge for runaway slaves. Carrying the comatose body of Marcelle and accompanied by two liberated slave girls, Adrian has to find medical help for Marcelle, but the slave master dragons will kill him on sight if he comes out of hiding.   Adrian hopes to join his brother and devise a plan to rescue other humans enslaved on Starlight. Since he cannot leave Marcelle alone, her nearly lifeless body becomes a physical and emotional anchor, and he is torn between helping her or attempting to rescue the slaves.   Meanwhile, Marcelle’s spirit travels to their home planet in search of military help. She is able to materialize there in a temporary body that looks corpselike and feels icy cold. Because of her appearance, Governor Orion persecutes her as a sorceress and sentences her to burn at the stake. Yet, she has hope of rescue in three allies—her father; an eccentric former teacher; and the mysterious Starlighter, Cassabrie.   Filled with excitement, twists and turns, and thought-provoking dilemmas, Third Starlighter will keep readers turning the pages.",English,English,Paperback,,464 pages,"

This was the guy I'd seen on my last journey back in time.Or more precisely, the one who'd kissed my doppelganger while I was hiding behind the curtain in disbelief.Sixteen-year-old Gwen lives with her extended - and rather eccentric - family in an exclusive London neighborhood. In spite of her ancestors' peculiar history, she's had a relatively normal life so far. The time-traveling gene that runs like a secret thread through the female half of the family is supposed to have skipped over Gwen, so she hasn't been introduced to ""the mysteries,"" and can spend her time hanging out with her best friend, Lesly. It comes as an unwelcome surprise when she starts taking sudden, uncontrolled leaps into the past.She's totally unprepared for time travel, not to mention all that comes with it: fancy clothes, archaic manners, a mysterious secret society, and Gideon, her time-traveling counterpart. He's obnoxious, a know-it-all, and possibly the best-looking guy she's seen in any century . . . .",0312551517,9780312551513),Paperback,,322 pages,"

A korábban a Különleges Erőknél szolgáló feleségével, Jane Sagannel él együtt, több hektáros tanyájukon földet művelnek, és büszkeségtől dagadó kebellel figyelik, hogyan cseperedik örökbefogadott lányuk, Zoë.A falusi idill nyolc évét azonban egy csapásra fenekestül felforgatja, amikor a Gyarmati Szövetség fejese kopogtat a portájukon. Az emberek gyarmatbirodalma ugyanis politikai válság szélére sodródott: a maroknyi telepes segítségével létesített egykori kolóniák az évek során annyira megerősödtek, hogy egy ideje maguk is gyarmatosítási jogot követelnek saját bolygóiknak. Ki más lehetne rátermettebb kormányzója a baljós nevű Roanoke-ra készülő, tíz külön világról érkezett, önfejű telepesnek, mint Perry, a békebíró és az ellentmondást nem tűrő Sagan? Az új kolóniához a Gyarmati Szövetség nagy reményeket fűz, de nem csak azért, mert ezzel megzabolázhatja az elégedetlenkedő gyarmatokat, hanem egy ennél grandiózusabb, magasztosabb cél hajtja, mely egyben Johnt és Jane-t is a galaktikus politika, ármány és cselszövés legmélyebb vízébe dobja, a fejük felett lebegő háború árnyáról már nem is beszélve.",9786155272264,9786155272264,Paperback,,304 pages,"

","From Scarlett Dawn comes the stunning, sexy, sensual, surprising, spell-binding conclusion to the best-selling first Forever Evermore trilogy. Queen Shifter, Lily Ruckler, has found solace in brutal warfare. Her bloodied fists and bared fangs fill the holes left in her memory, the blank spaces that leave her soul aching and empty. Her only pleasure is in blood; her only salvation is the relationship she has with her infant child, the baby of unknown origins who brings her solace and stability.When Elder Harcourt summons Lily and her protector Antonio back to the United States, Lily thinks nothing unusual about the change of location. But a standard reconnaissance mission leaves her trapped inside King Zeller’s private quarters, and at his mercy. Surprise attraction rapidly turns to a battle of wills and an intense power struggle that leaves no clear victor but plenty of resentment.They are not allowed to nurse their wounds. In order to win the war against the Commoners, the King Vampire and Queen Shifter must work together. It should be easy. The war is turning, the battle is deadly, and both Lily and Ezra love the cold cleanliness of combat. But their chance meeting has led to more than an unlikely alliance. Secrets have a way of surfacing, especially on a torn-up battlefield, and Lily and Ezra are about to re-learn all they cannot remember. If they can’t control their emotions and responses, it will be to their own ruin and the destruction of everything around them.",English,English,ebook,,209 pages,"

","Fernando Pessoa was many writers in one. He attributed his prolific writings to a wide range of alternate selves, each of which had a distinct biography, ideology. and horoscope. When he died in 1935, Pessoa left behind a trunk filled with unfinished and unpublished writings, among which were the remarkable pages that make up his posthumous masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet, an astonishing work that, in George Steiner's words, ""gives to Lisbon the haunting spell of Joyce's Dublin or Kafka's Prague.""Published for the first time some fifty years after his death, this unique collection of short, aphoristic paragraphs comprises the ""autobiography"" of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's alternate selves. Part intimate diary, part prose poetry, part descriptive narrative, The Book of Disquiet is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.Fernando Pessoa, one of the founders of modernism, was born in Lisbon in 1888. Most of Pessoa's writing was not published during his lifetime: The Book of Disquiet was first published in Portugal in 1982.",1846687357,9781846687358),Paperback,,262 pages,"

","My name is Madeleine Warwick and I'm a woman under siege.  Several years ago, a treasure hunting reality show resurrected the long-forgotten tale of Civil War treasure buried on my family's property. Ever since, amateur treasure hunters have been trespassing, invading our land. When their negligence cost my uncle his life, I forged a letter to disprove the treasure's existence. This stopped the hunters – but only for a time. Now they are coming back and, what’s worse, my secret has been discovered.  Arrogant Professor Gregory Randall knows about the forged letter, and he can ruin me with one phone call. But he won’t – as long I let him stay on the property to search for the treasure himself. It isn't easy living in the same house as your blackmailer, and there's more to Randall than meets the eye. He’s convinced there’s something to find, and I’m starting to think he might be right.  But even as we race to find the treasure first, the situation is becoming dangerous. Someone is determined to stop us: and they aren't afraid to use violence to do so. I’m running out of ideas, options, and time, and what’s worse, my blackmailer is the only one I can rely on.  My first defense is the last man I can trust.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,351 pages,"

","Primeiro livro escrito por George R. R. Martin, autor da renomada série As crônicas de gelo e fogo e premiado com os principais prêmios do mundo de fantasia e ficção científica. Desde essa primeira história o autor já mostra o que o tornaria mundialmente famoso, seus personagens que não são nem vilões, nem heróis, mas seres complexos como todos nós. Worlorn não é o planeta que Dirk t´Larien imaginava, e Gwen Delvano não é mais a mulher que conhecera. Ela está ligada a outro homem e a esse planeta moribundo preso no crepúsculo, seguindo em direção à noite sem fim. Em meio à paisagem desoladora, há um violento choque de culturas, no qual não há códigos ou honra e uma batalha se espalhará rapidamente.Sobre o autor: George R.R. Martin trabalhou dez anos em Hollywood como escritor e produtor de diversas séries e filmes de grande sucesso. Autor de diversos best-sellers nos EUA e na Europa, foi em meados dos anos 1990 que Martin deu início a sua mais importante obra: As crônicas de gelo e fogo, a saga de fantasia mais vendida dos últimos anos, vencedora de diversos prêmios, que ganhou a premiada adaptaçãoGame of Thrones pela HBO e também chegou aos quadrinhos.–",B017N02XP4,B017N02XP4,Kindle Edition,,334 pages,"

","Since its first publication in 1981, the short novel True Names by Vernor Vinge has been considered one of the most seminal science fiction works to present a fully fleshed-out concept of cyberspace. A finalist for the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best novella and winner of the Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, True Names was an inspiration to many innovators who have helped shape the world wide web as we know it today.The paperback edition of True Names and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier, published in 2001, also contained a feast of articles by computer scientists on the cutting edge of digital science, including Danny Hillis, the founder of Thinking Machines and the first Disney Fellow; Timothy C. May, former chief scientist at Intel; Marvin Minsky, co-founder of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, considered by many to be the ""father"" of AI; Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer, co-developers of habitat, the first real computer interactive environment; Mark Pesce, co-creator of VRML and the author of the Playful World: How Technology Transforms Our Imagination; and others.This first e-book edition includes all this, plus: a preface written especially for this edition by editor James Frenkel.  an article on the difficulty of keeping information secure by Internet security expert Bruce Schneier. a passionate plea regarding the right to privacy by Richard Stallman, founder of the project to develop the free/libre GNU operating system and one of the most important advocates of free/libre software. True Names itself is the heart of this important book: an exciting, suspenseful science fiction tale still as fresh and intriguing as when it was first published nearly thirty-five years ago.",B00VPX20KE,B00VPX20KE,Kindle Edition,,354 pages,"

","Putting food on the table for the family quickly and economically doesn't mean you have to compromise on quality. This book shows how Hugh's approach to food can be adapted to suit any growing, working family, or busy young singles and couples for that matter. Breakfast, baking, lunchboxes, quick suppers, healthy snacks, eating on the move and weekend cooking for the week ahead – all these, and more, will be covered in River Cottage Every Day.As Hugh says:'I make no prior assumptions about where you shop, what you may or may not know about growing vegetables or keeping livestock, whether you can tell the difference between a swede and turnip, or know what to do with a belly of pork and a breast of lamb. Instead, I'll show you easy and confidence-inspiring ways with cuts of meat, types of fish and other ingredients you may not have tried before. And I'll offer you new approaches that I hope will breath new life to familiar staples, like rice, spuds, beans, and your daily bread.Above all, I intend to tempt you irresistibly towards a better life with food, with a whole raft of recipes that I think you will love. I hope some of them will become your absolute favourites, and the favourites of your dear friends and beloved family. I hope that the dishes you like best will infiltrate and influence your cooking, giving you increased confidence and fresh ideas. In short, I hope that before long, cooking simple and delicious food from the best seasonal ingredients becomes second nature and first priority for you, not just once in a while, but every day.'",English,English,Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","Amir en Hassan zijn gevoed door dezelfde min en groeien samen op in de hoofdstad van Afghanistan. Als blijk van hun verbondenheid kerft Amir hun namen in een granaatappelboom: 'Amir en Hassan, de sultans van Kabul'. Maar sultans zijn ze alleen in hun fantasie, want Amir hoort tot de bevoorrechte bevolkingsgroep en Hassan en zijn vader zijn arme Hazaren, in dienst van Amirs vader. Bij de jaarlijkse vliegerwedstrijd in Kabul is Amir de vliegeraar, degene die het touw van de vlieger in handen heeft. Hassan is zijn hulpje, de vliegervanger. 'Voor jou doe ik alles!' roept Hassan hem toe voordat hij wegrent om de vallende vlieger uit de lucht op te vangen. Die grenzeloze loyaliteit is niet wederzijds. Wanneer er iets vreselijks gebeurt met Hassan verraadt hij zijn trouwe metgezel. Na de Russische inval vluchten Amir en zijn vader naar de Verenigde Staten. Amir bouwt er een nieuw bestaan op, maar hij slaagt er niet in Hassan te vergeten. De ontdekking van een schokkend familiegeheim voert hem uiteindelijk terug naar Afghanistan, dat inmiddels door de Taliban is bezet. Daar wordt Amir geconfronteerd met spoken uit zijn verleden. Zijn voornemen om zijn oude schuld jegens Hassan in te lossen sleept hem tegen wil en dank mee in een huiveringwekkend avontuur.",9023418999,9789023418993),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Clement and Angel are fraternal twins separated at birth; they grow up in the same small, frontier logging town of Stillwater, Minnesota. Clement was left at the orphanage. Angel was adopted by the town’s richest couple, but is marked and threatened by her mother’s mental illness. They rarely meet, but Clement knows if he is truly in need, Angel will come to save him. Stillwater, near the Mississippi River and Canada, becomes an important stop on the Underground Railroad. As Clement and Angel grow up and the country marches to war, their lives are changed by many battles for freedom and by losses in the struggle for independence, large and small.Stillwater reveals the hardscrabble lives of pioneers, nuns, squaws, fur trappers, loggers, runaway slaves and freedmen, outlaws and people of conscience, all seeking a better, freer, more prosperous future. It is a novel about mothers, about siblings, about the ways in which we must take care of one another and let go of one another. And it’s brought to us in Nicole Helget’s winning, gorgeous prose.",Minnesota,(2015),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Set on the coast of England against the vivid background of the sea, The Waves introduces six characters—three men and three women—who are grappling with the death of a beloved friend, Percival. Instead of describing their outward expressions of grief, Virginia Woolf draws her characters from the inside, revealing them through their thoughts and interior soliloquies. As their understanding of nature’s trials grows, the chorus of narrative voices blends together in miraculous harmony, remarking not only on the inevitable death of individuals but on the eternal connection of everyone. The novel that most epitomizes Virginia Woolf’s theories of fiction in the working form, The Waves is an amazing book very much ahead of its time. It is a poetic dreamscape, visual, experimental, and thrilling.",0141182717,9780141182711),Paperback,Penguin Modern Classics,228 pages,"

","Körlük, 1998 yılı 'Nobel Edebiyat Ödülü' sahibi Portekizli yazar Jose Saramago'nun son yıllarda yazdığı en etkileyici kitap. Araba kullanmakta olan bir adam, yeşil ışığın yanmasını beklerken ansızın körleşir. Körlüğü, başvurduğu doktora da bulaşır. Bu körlük, bir salgın hastalık gibi bütün kente yayılır; öldürücü olmasa da tüm ahlaki değerleri yok etmeyi başarır. Toplum, görmeyen gözlerle cinayetlere, tecavüzlere tanık olur. Ayakta kalabilenler ancak güçlü olanlardır. Koca kentte körlükten kurtulan tek kişi, göz doktorunun karısıdır. Portekiz'in yaşayan en önemli yazarı olan Jose Saramago, bu çarpıcı romanında körlük olgusunu bir metafor olarak kullanmış, basit imgelere, sıradan sözcük oyunlarına başvurmadan, yoğun bir anlatımla, anlatıcının ve kahramanların konuşmalarını ortaklaşa bir monologa dönüştürerek, kurgunun evrenselleşebilmesi açısından kişilere ad vermeksizin liberal demokrasinin insanları sürüklediği sağlıksız ortamı olağanüstü bir ustalıkla yaratmıştır.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

","This is the final battle.The Alliance is losing the war, and their most critical weapon, seventeen-year-old witch Nathan Byrn, is losing his mind. Nathan’s tally of kills is rising, and yet he’s no closer to ending the tyrannical rule of the Council of White Witches in England. Nor is Nathan any closer to his personal goal: getting revenge on Annalise, the girl he once loved before she committed an unthinkable crime. An amulet protected by the extremely powerful witch Ledger could be the tool Nathan needs to save himself and the Alliance, but this amulet is not so easily acquired. And lately Nathan has started to suffer from visions: a vision of a golden moment when he dies, and of an endless line of Hunters, impossible to overcome. Gabriel, his closest companion, urges Nathan to run away with him, to start a peaceful life together. But even Gabriel’s love may not be enough to save Nathan from this war, or from the person he has become.Set in modern-day Europe, the final book in the Half Bad trilogy is more than a story about witches. It’s a heart-achingly visceral look at survival and exploitation, the nature of good and evil, and the risks we take for love.",0670017140,9780670017140),Hardcover,,340 pages,"

","الجنة والنار"" هو عنوان هذا الجزء وهو الثالث من كتاب اليوم الآخر للدكتور ""عمر سليمان الأشقر"" وهو يحتوي على بابين الباب الأول فيه حديث عن النار تعرفها، عدد خزنتها من الملائكة وعظم خلقهم، وصف النار، مكانتها، وسعتها، ودكاتها، وأبوابها، ووقودها، وشدة حرها، وكلامها، وصفة خلقها، وتأثيرها على الدنيا وأهلها، وكثرة أهل النار، وهنا تم سوق عدد من النصوص الدالة على كثرة الهالكين فيها، وقلة الناجين والسر في ذلك، كما وتم التطرق هنا لموضوع النساء باعتبارهن أكثر أهل النار، كما وتم التعرض لطعام أهل النار ومشاربهم، وعذابهم. وفي هذا الموضوع ساق المؤلف العدد من الصور التي تصور عذابهم، كما بين أن أهل النار متفاوتون في عذابهم في النار، ثم ذكر شيئاً من أنواع العذاب أعده الله لهم، ومنه الصهر، واللفح، والسحب، وتسويد الوجوه، وإنضاج الجلود، واندلاق الأمعاء، وإطلاع النار على أفئدتهم، كما ساق النصوص المبينة لقيودهم وأغلالهم وسلاسلهم ومطارقهم التي يعذبون بها... أما الباب الثاني فخصصه للحديث عن الجنة معرفاً بها، وبسكانها المسلمين وبصفاتهم، وبخلودهم فيها، وفي مرحلة لاحقة تحدث عن صفة الجنة، مبيناً أبوابها، دراجاتها تربتها، أنهارها، عيونها، قصورها، نورها، ريحها، أشجارها وثمارها، وريحانها، أما نعيم أهل الجنة فأفرد له مبحث خاص، تحدث فيه عن تمتع أهل الجنة بأنواع الطعام والشراب. كما تحدث عن فرشهم وخدمهم وسوقهم وآنية طعامهم وشرابهم، وعن اللباس الذي يلبسونه، والأماني التي يتمنونها، أزواج المؤمنين في الجنة، وأعمالهم التي استحقوا عنها الجنة، وفسر كيف برث أهل الجنة، وأعمالهم التي استحقوا عنها الجنة، وفسر كيف يرث أهل الجنة نصيب أهل النار في الجنة. وبين أن الضعفاء في الجنة أكثر من الأغنياء وأن الرجال أكثر فيها من النساء، وحقق القول في مسألة دخول أطفال المؤمنين وأطفال المشركين الجنة... ومن المباحث التي تضمنها هذا الباب ذكر سادة أهل الجنة كهولاً وشبانا ونساء، وذكر العشرة المبشرين بالجنة، وذكر أسماء بعض من نص على أنه من الجنة، وختم البحث بذكر أن الجنة بذكر أن الجنة ليست ثمناً للعمل بل العمل سبب لدخول الجنة، ونيل الجنة إنما هو برحمة الله وفضله.رابط التحميل:http://www.waqfeya.com/book.php?bid=508",Arabic,Arabic,Paperback,,271 pages,"

","Chloe Saunders are cincisprezece ani si tare ar fi vrut sa fie normala. Din nefericire, Chloe se intampla sa fie o necromanta careia o modificare genetica i-a crescut intr-atat puterile, incat poate invia mortii chiar si fara sa incerce. Ea si la fel de supradotatii (sau ar trebui numiti ""blestematii""?) sai prieteni fug acum sa scape cu viata de malefica organizatie care i-a creat. De parca asta n-ar fi destul, Chloe se lupta cu sentimentele ei pentru Simon, un vrajitor prietenos, si pentru fratele sau Derek, un varcolac nu la fel de prietenos. Si are oribila presimtire ca inclina catre varcolac... Categoric anormal. In Rafuiala, volumul care incheie seria bestseller Fortele Raului Absolut, suspansul ajungela apogeu. Chloe Saunders si prietenii ei modificati genetic se afla in sfarsit in siguranta, departe de Grupul Edison. Dar, nesiguri in privinta intentiilor noilor lor protectori, Chloe, Derek, Simon si Tori se simt prinsi intr-o capcana si nu se pot hotari in privinta pasilor urmatori pe care ii au de facut pentru a-si salva pielea si pentru a le elibera si pe Rae si pe matusa Lauren.

Algo lo suficientemente alarmante como para que sus padres la encierren en el garaje y llamen inmediatamente a la policía buscando ayuda. Ha sucedido. Un fenómeno inexplicable le ha arrancado de la vida que siempre ha conocido, y la ha repudiado a Thurmond, el escalofriante campo de rehabilitación del gobierno donde se destinan a los supervivientes.

","Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone in feeling discontent. Harbouring an unnatural desire for solitude, and a perverse distaste for the pleasure of compulsory promiscuity, Bernard has an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his distress. Huxley's ingenious fantasy of the future sheds a blazing light on the present and is considered to be his most enduring masterpiece.",0099458160,9780099458166),Paperback,,229 pages,"

","«Pues ahora viene lo mejor. Resulta que hoy un tipo muy raro nos ha llevado en su lancha hasta la isla de Ons, y allí nos ha enseñado la entrada de esta zona del mundo al infierno. ¡Al mismísimo infierno, nada menos! Y ahora estamos tú y yo aquí sentados, tomando tequila después de casi doce años. Tú debes de pensar que todo esto es una locura, y yo, simplemente, ya no sé qué pensar... ¿Cómo lo ves?».Simón Varela, arquitecto, es un reputado especialista en construcción de gallineros, chiringuitos de playa y otras chapuzas por el estilo. Su fina ironía y su instinto para sobrevivir son sus dos puntos fuertes. Por eso, un encargo de restauración en la finca de una de las familias más poderosas –y turbias– de Vigo le resulta tan sorprendente como alarmante. Sin embargo, la revelación de un inesperado secreto familiar que le incumbe y la belleza adictiva de una mujer a la que no quiere renunciar le impulsan a quedarse y a afrontar la situación como lo haría un personaje de Raymond Chandler, pero en versión gallega y ciertamente poco glamurosa.El debut de Pedro Feijoo en la narrativa no puede ser mejor, como confirma su rotundo éxito en Galicia.

Controversial still, this novel has weathered continual debates on all aspects of its writing and its subject matter. In her eloquent introduction, noted American Studies scholar Ann Douglas establishes the historical and literary significance of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"": accurate in its portrayal of the slave experience, brilliant in its narrative structure and use of dialogue, and profoundly feminist in its implications.",English,English,Paperback,,629 pages,"

Un músico tendrá que enfrentarse a su pasado para encontrar la verdadera intención del juego, mientras una secreta hermandad de descendientes pitagóricos maneja un descabellado fin para el mismo premio.

Loin de n'être que le récit de la réhabilitation d'un forçat évadé victime de la société, Les Misérables sont avant tout l'histoire du peuple de Paris. Jean Valjean, et le lien qui l'unit à Cosette, en est le fil conducteur et le symbole. Homme du peuple par excellence, damné et accablé par les humiliations successives, Jean Valjean prend sur lui le péché du monde et l'expie. Dans son effort incessant pour se racheter, il assume un destin tragique qui nous renvoie le reflet de l'humanité en marche.Hugo retrace ici avec force les misères et les heures glorieuses des masses vivantes qui se retrouvent.

","During the Great Depression, pulp fiction writers created a new, distinctly American detective story, one that stressed the development of fascinating, often bizarre characters rather than the twists and turns of clever plots. This new crime fiction adapted brilliantly to the screen, birthing a cinematic genre that French cinema intellectuals following World War II christened ""film noir."" Set on dark streets late at night, in cheap hotels and bars, and populated by the dangerous people who frequented these locales, these films introduced a new antihero, a tough, brooding, rebellious loner, embodied by Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. This volume provides a detailed exploration of film noir, tracing its evolution, the influence of such legendary writers as Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, and the films that propelled this dark genre to popularity in the mid-20th century.",English,English,Paperback,,222 pages,"

","The essence of nonviolence is our ability to awaken the consciousness to a higher level. Nonviolence is considered as the highest virtue because nonviolence has the capacity to transform individual, society and the world. Transformation happens slowly and silently in every single moment, without notice. Nonviolence is only for the brave men and women of the world because it requires courage – courage to love the beauty of life, beauty of humanity and the beauty of the world. It also requires courage to discard the old beliefs and the old ideas of religions and spiritualities in the framework of true humanity and love. In this book Dr.Ray explained the practical ways of practicing nonviolence in daily life. The seeds of violence exist in the daily feelings of suppression, guilt, shame and disappointments. These seeds can be eliminated by practicing simple techniques. The book deals with all the practical issues of practicing nonviolence.",English,English,,,,,"['Inspirational', 'Spirituality', 'Self Help', 'Nonfiction']"

","A Doll's House is a three-act play in prose by Henrik Ibsen. It premiered at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month. The play is significant for its critical attitude toward 19th-century marriage norms. It aroused great controversy at the time, as it concludes with the protagonist, Nora, leaving her husband and children because she wants to discover herself. Ibsen was inspired by the belief that ""a woman cannot be herself in modern society,"" since it is ""an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint."" Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: Michael Meyer argued that the play's theme is not women's rights, but rather ""the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person."" In a speech given to the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he ""must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement,"" since he wrote ""without any conscious thought of making propaganda,"" his task having been ""the description of humanity.""",1536976989,9781536976984),Paperback,,100 pages,"

","""This is a record of hate far more than of love,"" writes Maurice Bendrix in the opening passages of The End of the Affair, and it is a strange hate indeed that compels him to set down the retrospective account of his adulterous affair with Sarah Miles. Now, a year after Sarah's death, Bendrix seeks to exorcise the persistence of his passion by retracing its course from obsessive love to love-hate. At first, he believes he hates Sarah and her husband, Henry. Yet as he delves further into his emotional outlook, Bendrix's hatred shifts to the God he feels has broken his life, but whose existence at last comes to recognize. Originally published in 1951, The End of the Affair was acclaimed by William Faulkner as ""for me one of the best, most true and moving novels of my time, in anybody's language.""",0140017852,9780140017854),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","As Lauren Layne’s salacious Sex, Love & Stiletto series returns, a jaded columnist discovers a steamy way to get over an old flame: falling for him all over again.   As Stiletto magazine’s authority on all things breakup-and-heartache, Emma Sinclair writes from personal experience. Five years ago, Emma was Charlotte, North Carolina’s darling debutante and a blushing bride-to-be. Now she’s the ice queen of the Manhattan dating scene. Emma left her sultry Southern drawl behind, but not even her closest friends know that with it she left her heart. Now Emma’s latest article forces her to face her demons—namely, the devilishly sexy guy who ditched her at the altar.    After giving up everything for a pro-soccer career, Alex Cassidy watches his dreams crumble as a knee injury sidelines him for good. Now he’s hanging up his cleats and giving journalism a shot. It’s just a coincidence that he happens to pick a job in the same field, and the same city, as his former fiancée . . . right? But when Emma moves in next door, it’s no accident. It’s research. And Alex can’t help wondering what might have been. Unlike the innocent girl he remembers, this Emma is chic, sophisticated, and assertive—and she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. The trouble is, Alex has never wanted her more.  Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from another Loveswept title.","Sex,",#4,ebook,,237 pages,"

","Max Brooks ha dedicado varios años a recorrer el mundo en busca de todos los testimonios que ahora reúne aquí sobre la guerra mundial zombi. Por insólito que parezca este libro, que algunos tildan de novela demasiado realista, es la parte censurada del informe que le encargó Naciones Unidas para que quedara memoria de «La Crisis», los «Años Oscuros» o la «Plaga Andante», principalmente conocida como Guerra Mundial Z. Al parecer había «demasiado factor humano».Este libro aclara realmente cómo el doctor Kwang Jingshu descubrió los primeros casos y se destaparon las pruebas ocultadas por el gobierno chino sobre el gran estallido. También cómo surgió y se propagó el controvertido Plan Naranja de supervivencia, fruto de un oscuro cerebro del apartheid sudafricano. Además contiene los testimonios directos de gentes de la posguerra: contrabandistas de Tíbet, oficiales de servicios secretos de medio mundo, militares, científicos, industriales, políticos, ecologistas, supermodelos, gentes de culturas alternativas tras el cataclismo y muchos otros que lucharon para defendernos de la amenaza de los zombis. También de aquellos que no lo hicieron tanto e incluso de aquellos que creen que la lucha continúa.Por fin, el mundo sabrá la historia verdadera de cómo la humanidad estuvo a punto de extinguirse. Desde el fin oficial de hostilidades se han producido numerosas tentativas para documentar la guerra zombi. Guerra Mundial Z es el relato definitivo –realizado por los propios supervivientes- de los detalles tecnológicos, militares, sociales, económicos y políticos de cómo la civilización estuvo al borde de la extinción en la lucha total contra el muerto viviente.Un relato insólito y realista, lleno de interrogantes sobre cómo se comportó la Humanidad ante la gran amenaza de la extinción",8496968812,9788496968813),Paperback,,464 pages,"

When he was ten, Bo claimed to have witnessed the Titanic hit an iceberg, and at fifteen, he found himself on a Civil War battlefield, horrified by the bodies surrounding him. So when his worried parents send him to a school for troubled youth, Bo assumes he knows the truth: that he’s actually attending Berkshire Academy, a school for kids who, like Bo, have “superpowers.”At Berkshire, Bo falls in love with Sofía, a quiet girl with a tragic past and the superpower of invisibility. Sofía helps Bo open up in a way he never has before. In turn, Bo provides comfort to Sofía, who lost her mother and two sisters at a very young age.But even the strength of their love isn’t enough to help Sofía escape her deep depression. After she commits suicide, Bo is convinced that she’s not actually dead. He believes that she’s stuck somewhere in time—that he somehow left her in the past, and that now it’s his job to save her. And as Bo becomes more and more determined to save Sofía, he must decide whether to face his demons head-on or succumb to a psychosis that will let him be with the girl he loves.",1595147152,9781595147158),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","Poignant in its honesty and grim in its details, Escape from Sobibor offers stunning proof of resistance--in this case successful--by victims of the Holocaust. The smallest of the extermination camps operated by Nazi Germany during World War II, Sobibor was where now-retired auto worker John Demjanjuk has been accused of working as a prison guard. Sobibor also was the scene of the war's biggest prisoner escape.   Richard Rashke's interviews with eighteen of  those who survived provide the foundation for this volume. He also draws on books, articles, and diaries to make vivid the camp, the uprising, and the escape. In the afterword, Rashke relates how the Polish government in October 1993, observed the fiftieth anniversary of the escape and how it has beautified the site since a film based on his book appeared on Polish television.  ",0252064798,9780252064791),Paperback,,416 pages,"

One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In full retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man’s essentially irrational nature.Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.",B0082Z4YIY,B0082Z4YIY,Kindle Edition,Public Domain,160 pages,"

In the meantime, they are dismissed as decadents living in a state of highly developed barbarism, hoarding data without order, hunting their own young and fighting pointless formal wars.Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of - part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony - Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer - a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known.As complex, turbulent, flamboyant and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, the new science fiction novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale.",B002TXZSOO,B002TXZSOO,Kindle Edition,,544 pages,"

","This is the first book in The Guardian Trilogy Sixteen year old Caroline Christiansen is a New Yorker born with the ability to see the dead. A harmless ability, if well ignored. When her mother suddenly decides to change careers, Caroline is left with no other option but to move to Denmark with her estranged father. For the high school student, moving to a small Scandinavian town after having lived her whole life in New York feels like the worst kind of punishment. That is until she begins to brush shoulders with the beautiful winged beings that are determined to change the course of her life forever. Life in the small viking town turns out not to be as boring as she had previously feared. What starts as a harmless encounter turns into a vicious contest, with her right in the center of it, as the beautiful creatures reveal their true nature, and condemn the whole world into joining their civil war unknowingly. Caroline quickly learns that there’s a worse fate than death, and just how much she’s willing to sacrifice for a cause that oughtn’t to be hers in the first place.",The,#1,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ISBN 1406307627. See other editions with this ISBN here and here.When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder― much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.",English,English,Paperback,,442 pages,"

","“While the history books are filled with tales of obsessive, visionary geniuses who remade the world in their image with sheer, almost irrational force, I’ve found that history is also made by individuals who fought their egos at every turn, who eschewed the spotlight, and who put their higher goals above their desire for recognition.” – from the PrologueMany of us insist the main impediment to a full, successful life is the outside world. In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.The Ego is the Enemy draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”",1591847818,9781591847816),Hardcover,,226 pages,"

Life is a constant struggle for the eighteen-year-old Nowak twins as they raise their three younger siblings in rural Poland under the shadow of the Nazi occupation. The constant threat of arrest has made everyone in their village a spy, and turned neighbor against neighbor. Though rugged, independent Helena and pretty, gentle Ruth couldn't be more different, they are staunch allies in protecting their family from the threats the war brings closer to their doorstep with each passing day. Then Helena discovers an American paratrooper stranded outside their small mountain village, wounded, but alive. Risking the safety of herself and her family, she hides Sam—a Jew—but Helena's concern for the American grows into something much deeper. Defying the perils that render a future together all but impossible, Sam and Helena make plans for the family to flee. But Helena is forced to contend with the jealousy her choices have sparked in Ruth, culminating in a singular act of betrayal that endangers them all—and setting in motion a chain of events that will reverberate across continents and decades.",0778315967,9780778315964),Paperback,,352 pages,"

Keelin is the only human fledgling, weaned by the drackans of the High Hills and given their instincts, ferocious strength, and fierce hatred for humankind. But even the drackans closest to her cannot explain why she has violent blackouts from which she wakens covered in blood.  A desperate, reckless search for the source of this secret brings her face to face with the human world and memories from a locked-away past, long forgotten. Keelin becomes a terrifying legend among human assassins while she hunts for answers, and the human realm’s High King is murdered.  While a sickly steward hides within crumbling walls, commanding her every move with a magic he should not possess, Keelin’s journey to track him down threatens her loyalty to the drackans who raised her. The rogue who crosses her path hides familiar secrets, echoing her own terrifying bloodlust and forcing her to consider that there may be something human about her after all.

","En ces premières années du XXIe siècle, le monde présente de nombreux signes de dérèglement. Dérèglement intellectuel, caractérisé par un déchaînement des affirmations identitaires qui rend difficiles toute coexistence harmo­nieuse et tout véritable débat. Dérèglement économique et financier, qui entraîne la planète entière dans une zone de turbulences aux conséquences imprévisibles, et qui est lui-même le symptôme d'une perturbation de notre système de valeurs. Dérèglement climatique, qui résulte d'une longue pratique de l'irresponsabilité...L'humanité aurait-elle atteint son «seuil d'incompétence morale» ?Dans cet essai ample, l'auteur cherche à comprendre comment on en est arrivé là et comment on pourrait s'en sortir. Pour lui, le dérèglement du monde tient moins à une «guerre des civilisations» qu'à l'épuisement simultané de toutes nos civilisations, et notamment des deux ensembles culturels dont il se réclame lui-même, à savoir l'Occident et le Monde arabe. Le premier, peu fidèle à ses propres valeurs ; le second, enfermé dans une impasse historique.Un diagnostic inquiétant, mais qui débouche sur une note d'espoir : la période tumultueuse où nous entrons pourrait nous amener à élaborer une vision enfin adulte de nos appartenances, de nos croyances, de nos différences, et du destin de la planète qui nous est commune.",French,French,Perfect Paperback,,314 pages,"

","A true triumph of voice and storytelling, ""The Book of Night Women"" rings with both profound authenticity and a distinctly contemporary energy. It is the story of Lilith, born into slavery on a Jamaican sugar plantation at the end of the eighteenth century. Even at her birth, the slave women around her recognize a dark power that they- and she-will come to both revere and fear. The Night Women, as they call themselves, have long been plotting a slave revolt, and as Lilith comes of age they see her as the key to their plans. But when she begins to understand her own feelings, desires, and identity, Lilith starts to push at the edges of what is imaginable for the life of a slave woman, and risks becoming the conspiracy's weak link. But the real revelation of the book-the secret to the stirring imagery and insistent prose-is Marlon James himself, a young writer at once breath?takingly daring and wholly in command of his craft.

","A Bond of Venom and Magic is a Young Adult fantasy that will delight fans of SJ Maas-A Court of Mist and Fury, and Cassandra Clare. The Wraith Lord is hunting; his prize, the key to unleashing darkness and Chaos upon the eight Kingdoms. For Diamond Gillon the war raging in the south seems a remote danger until her home is brutally attacked. Having lost everything she holds dear, Diamond is catapulted into a terrifying new world in which legendary beasts arise, magic is condemned and half blood fae, like her, have no rights. Despite her growing feelings for her saviour, Commander Hugo Casimir, he remains a paradox - not only is he a heartless killer, he is owned by the cruel immortal fae queen; a queen who will murder her own people for magic. As Diamond's circumstances become ever more perilous she is drawn deeper into Hugo's world and discovers the lengths to which he will go to save what he holds dear. Will Hugo become her friend, her protector, or - an enemy not worthy of her trust? A Bond of Venom and Magic is a tale of two people bound by magic and secrets, but trapped in the complexities of love and betrayal. It is the beginning of an epic journey, one that will test Diamond's resolve and determination to battle an evil that threatens not only her world but that of Eternity, the land of The Goddess and the Guardians.",1534838864,9781534838864),Paperback,,302 pages,"

","This book covers yoga as a part of comprehensive human well-being strategy. The wide scope of yoga as a policy of well-being is explained. Traditionally, science of well-being has been considered as a branch of social science. However, it is currently considered as an interdisciplinary science that collaborates with other fields such as medicine, neuroscience, neurobiology, physiology, chemistry, psychology, genetics, behavioral science, social science and economics. Science of well-being includes physical well-being, mental well-being, spiritual well-being and social well-being. In the book Dr. Ray explains how yoga is related to all these four aspects of well-being. Yoga has four central components: physical yoga, energy yoga, action-yoga and wisdom-yoga. Each of these four domains is related to a different meaning of the scientifically clumsy term “well-being,” and each has its own road to happiness. . Throughout the life our song changes, in the young age we need education at the older age we need protection and care. Therefore life has many levels of well-being. Yoga deals with all levels of well-being in a systematic manner. The author does a great job explaining what yoga can offer for the well-being of individual and for the society as a whole.",English,English,,,120 pages,"

","From online entertainment mogul, actress, and “queen of the geeks” Felicia Day, a funny, quirky, and inspiring memoir about her unusual upbringing, her rise to Internet-stardom, and embracing her individuality to find success in Hollywood.The Internet isn’t all cat videos. There’s also Felicia Day—violinist, filmmaker, Internet entrepreneur, compulsive gamer, hoagie specialist, and former lonely homeschooled girl who overcame her isolated childhood to become the ruler of a new world... or at least semi-influential in the world of Internet Geeks and Goodreads book clubs.After growing up in the south where she was ""home-schooled for hippie reasons"", Felicia moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming an actress and was immediately typecast as a crazy cat-lady secretary. But Felicia’s misadventures in Hollywood led her to produce her own web series, own her own production company, and become an Internet star.Felicia’s short-ish life and her rags-to-riches rise to Internet fame launched her career as one of the most influential creators in new media. Now, Felicia’s strange world is filled with thoughts on creativity, video games, and a dash of mild feminist activism—just like her memoir.Hilarious and inspirational, You’re Never Weird on the Internet (Almost) is proof that everyone should embrace what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible now—even for a digital misfit.",1476785651,9781476785653),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

Which makes it hard for him to be in love with his straight best friend. For his part, Matt is completely oblivious to the way Tretch feels – and Tretch can’t tell whether that makes it better or worse. The problem with living a lie is that the lie can slowly become your life. For Tretch, the problem isn’t just with Matt. His family has no idea who he really is and what he’s really thinking. The girl at the local bookstore has no clue how off-base her crush on him is. And the guy at school who’s a thorn in Tretch’s side doesn’t realize how close to the truth he’s hitting. Tretch has spent a lot of time dancing alone in his room, but now he’s got to step outside his comfort zone and into the wider world. Because like love, a true self can rarely be contained.

","An electrifying memoir by the blind Chinese activist who inspired millions with the story of his fight for justice and his belief in the cause of freedomIt was like a scene out of a thriller: one morning in April 2012, China's most famous political activist—a blind, self-taught lawyer—climbed over the wall of his heavily guarded home and escaped. Days later, he turned up at the American embassy in Beijing, and only a furious round of high-level negotiations made it possible for him to leave China and begin a new life in the United States.Chen Guangcheng is a unique figure on the world stage, but his story is even more remarkable than anyone knew. The son of a poor farmer in rural China, blinded by illness when he was an infant, Chen was fortunate to survive a difficult childhood. But despite his disability, he was determined to educate himself and fight for the rights of his country's poor, especially a legion of women who had endured forced sterilizations and abortions under the hated ""one child"" policy. Repeatedly harassed, beaten, and imprisoned by Chinese authorities, Chen was ultimately placed under house arrest. After nearly two years of increasing danger, he evaded his captors and fled to freedom.Both a riveting memoir and a revealing portrait of modern China, The Barefoot Lawyer tells the story of a man who has never accepted limits and always believed in the power of the human spirit to overcome any obstacle.",0805098054,9780805098051),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","È l'estate del 1962 quando Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan torna a vivere in famiglia a Jackson, in Mississippi, dopo aver frequentato l'università lontano da casa. Skeeter è molto diversa dalle sue amiche di un tempo, già sposate e perfettamente inserite in un modello di vita borghese, e sogna in segreto di diventare scrittrice. Aibileen è una domestica di colore. Saggia e materna, ha allevato amorevolmente uno dopo l'altro diciassette bambini bianchi, facendo le veci delle loro madri spesso assenti. Ma il destino è stato crudele con lei, portandole via il suo unico figlio. Minny è la sua migliore amica. Bassa, grassa, con un marito violento e una piccola tribù di figli, è con ogni probabilità la donna più sfacciata e insolente di tutto il Mississippi. Cuoca straordinaria, non sa però tenere a freno la lingua e viene licenziata di continuo. Sono gli anni in cui Bob Dylan inizia a testimoniare con le sue canzoni la protesta nascente, e il colore della pelle è ancora un ostacolo insormontabile. Nonostante ciò, Skeeter, Aibileen e Minny si ritrovano a lavorare segretamente a un progetto comune che le esporrà a gravi rischi. Il profondo Sud degli Stati Uniti fa da cornice a questa opera prima che ruota intorno ai sentimenti, all'amicizia e alla forza che può scaturire dal sostegno reciproco. Kathryn Stockett racconta personaggi a tutto tondo che fanno ridere, pensare e commuovere con la loro intelligenza, il loro coraggio e la loro capacità di uscire dagli schemi alla ricerca di un mondo migliore.",8804628634,9788804628637),Paperback,Oscar Bestsellers,532 pages,"

","In this striking literary debut, Carol Rifka Brunt unfolds a moving story of love, grief, and renewal as two lonely people become the unlikeliest of friends and find that sometimes you don't know you've lost someone until you've found them. 1987. There's only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that's her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn's company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June's world is turned upside down. But Finn's death brings a surprise acquaintance into June's life—someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart. At Finn's funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn's apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes she's not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most. An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, Tell the Wolves I'm Home is a tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way compassion can make us whole again.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,360 pages,"

","""Já que muitos empreenderam compor uma narração dos factos que entre nós se consumaram, como no-los transmitiram os que desde o princípio foram testemunhas oculares e se tornaram servidores da Palavra, resolvi eu também, depois de tudo ter investigado cuidadosamente desde a origem, expor-tos por escrito e pela sua ordem, ilustre Teófilo, afim de que reconheças a solidez da doutrina em que fostre instruído."" Lucas, 1, 1-4""Jesus morre, morre, e já o vai deixando a vida, quando de súbito o céu por cima da sua cabeça se abre de par a par e Deus aparece, vestindo como estivera na barca, e a sua voz ressoa por toda a terra, dizendo, Tu és o meu Filho muito amado, em ti pus toda a minha complacência. Então Jesus compreendeu que viera trazido ao engano como se leva o cordeiro ao sacrifício, que a sua vida fora traçada para morrer assim desde o princípio dos princípios, e, subindo-lhe à lembrança o rio de sangue e de sofrimento que do seu lado irá nascer e alargar toda a terra, clamou para o céu aberto onde Deus sorria, Homens, perdoai-lhe, porque ele não sabe o que fez. Depois, foi morrendo no meio de um sonho, estava em Nazaré e ouvia o pai dizer-lhe, encolhendo os ombros e sorrindo também, Nem eu posso fazer-te todas as perguntas, nem tu podes dar-me todas as respostas. Ainda havia nele um resto de vida quando sentiu que uma esponja embebida em água e vinagre lhe roçava os lábios, e então, olhando para baixo, deu por um homem que se afastava com um balde e uma cana ao ombro. Já não chegou a ver, posta no chão, a tigela negra onde o seu sangue gotejava.""""«É a obra mais polémica de José Saramago e aquela que, indirectamente, o levou a sair de Portugal e a refugiar-se na ilha espanhola de Lanzarote. Ficou para a história o desentendimento com o então subsecretário de estado da Cultura Sousa Lara, que considerou o livro ofensivo para a tradição católica portuguesa e o retirou da lista do Prémio Europeu de Literatura. Com um José destroçado por ter fugido e deixado as crianças de Belém nas mãos dos assassinos de Herodes; com uma Maria dobrada e descrita, logo no início do livro, em pleno acto de conhecer homem; com um Jesus temeroso, um Judas generoso, uma Madalena voluptuosa, um Deus vingativo e um Diabo simpático, não era de esperar outra reacção das almas mais sensíveis e mais devotas do catolicismo português. E verdadeiramente viperinas são as várias páginas onde o escritor português se entretém a descrever minuciosamente os nomes e a forma como morreram os mártires dos primeiros séculos do cristianismo. Assim se escreveram os heréticos Evangelhos segundo Saramago, para irritação de muitos e prazer de alguns.

","Zu den wichtigsten Frühwerken Hermann Hesses gehört sein Schulroman Unterm Rad über das Schicksal eines begabten Kindes, das am Erwartungsdruck seines Vaters und der Umwelt zerbricht. Hesse hat darin viel von dem verarbeitet, was er selbst erleben mußte. So glaubten seine Erzieher, den 14jährigen in einer Heilanstalt für Schwachsinnige und Epileptische unterbringen zu müssen. Es war der Leidensdruck dieser frühen Erfahrungen, der ihn zum Schriftsteller gemacht hat und dem auch seine späteren Werke ihre Brisanz und zeitlose Aktualität verdanken. Wie kein anderes Werk des Dichters hat dieses Buch eine genau dokumentierbare Vorgeschichte, die hier erstmals in allen überlieferten Lebenszeugnissen vorgestellt wird und ein authentisches Bild der Pädagogik vom Ende des 19.

","Music in His Bones Kay: A bad boy kind of guy – who could have become a rock star in his own right, but quit that career to become the producer his father and brothers needed him to be. He is quite happy as long as he does not allow himself to take a guitar into his hands, that is until his father issues the challenge to all three brothers to find the next big star and puts him right in Nell's path. She has all that it takes to be the new emerging star for his company, and Kay finds he' is already interested in the very talented young woman romantically. Music in His SoulNate is the one brother who has absolutely no talent in the music department and he is quite content with his life which is going according to plan – business school followed by a career at the family’s billion-dollar music business. There is no place for men in Anna’s disaster of a life – even for a handsome and meticulously organized man, who craves to bring order into that mess. Nate believes he can cope with a kid and a business that is seemingly on the verge of collapse. What he for sure will not handle is finding out his woman is also into music. Music in His HeartWhat do you do when an attractive woman tries to pick you up at a bar? For Christian the answer is simple – you let her. Sam is tipsy but quite aware of her attraction to this stranger, and would be even terrifying would be to be reminded of her actions the next morning. Sam is an award-winning composer, who has been turning down Christian’s company’s deals for years, while for Christian this deal might mean serious promotion and finally praise from his strict father and two older brothers’ whose success have been overshadowing him his whole life. The problem is that Sam has not written a line since the goddamn award three years ago.",B01JMGA9BM,B01JMGA9BM,Kindle Edition,,,"

","""Positively tailor-made for reading—or reading aloud—by flashlight,"" declares Kirkus Reviews in a starred review. The phenomenally versatile, award-winning author, Candace Fleming, gives teen and older tween readers ten ghost stories sure to send chills up their spines. Set in White Cemetery, an actual graveyard outside Chicago, each story takes place during a different time period from the 1860's to the present, and ends with the narrator's death. Some teens die heroically, others ironically, but all due to supernatural causes. Readers will meet walking corpses and witness demonic posession, all against the backdrop of Chicago's rich history—the Great Depression, the World's Fair, Al Capone and his fellow gangsters.",English,English,Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","A landmark book of popular science—a lucid, engaging account of how the human body evolved over millions of years and of how the increasing disparity between the jumble of adaptations in our Stone Age bodies and the modern world is fueling the paradox of greater longevity but more chronic disease.   In a book that illuminates, as never before, the evolutionary story of the human body, Daniel Lieberman deftly examines the major transformations that contributed key adaptations to the body: the advent of bipedalism; the shift to a non-fruit-based diet; the rise of hunting and gathering and our superlative endurance athletic abilities; the development of a very large brain; and the incipience of modern cultural abilities. He elucidates how cultural evolution differs from biological evolution, and how it further transformed our bodies during the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions. Lieberman illuminates how these ongoing changes have brought many benefits, but also have created novel conditions to which our bodies are not entirely adapted, resulting in a growing incidence of obesity and new but avoidable diseases, including type-2 diabetes. He proposes that many of these chronic illnesses persist and in some cases are intensifying because of ""dysevolution,"" a pernicious dynamic whereby only the symptoms rather than the causes of these maladies are treated. And finally—provocatively—he advocates the use of evolutionary information to help nudge, push, and sometimes oblige us to create a more salubrious environment.(With charts and line drawings throughout.)From the Hardcover edition.",0307907414,9780307907417),ebook,,480 pages,"

","At the beginning of the twentieth century psychologists discovered ways and means to measure intelligence that developed into an obsession with IQ. In the mid 1990's, Daniel Goleman popularised research into emotional intelligence, EQ, pointing out that EQ is a basic requirement for the appropriate use of IQ. In this century, there is enough collective evidence from psychology, neurology, anthropology and cognitive science to show us that there is a third 'Q', 'SQ' or Spiritual Intelligence. SQ is uniquely human and, the authors argue, the most fundamental intelligence. SQ is what we use to develop our longing and capacity for meaning, vision and value. It allows us to dream and to strive. It underlies the things we believe in, and the role our beliefs and values play in the actions that we take and the way we shape our lives.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,336 pages,"

No one is allowed outside after dark. Yet night is the only time that Kymera can enter this dangerous city, for she must not be seen by humans. Her father says they would not understand her wings, the bolts in her neck, or her spiky tail—they would kill her. They would not understand that she was created for a purpose: to rescue the girls of Bryre. Despite her caution, a boy named Ren sees Kym and begins to leave a perfect red rose for her every evening. As they become friends, Kym learns that Ren knows about the missing girls, the wizard, and the evil magic that haunts Bryre.

","This stunning volume was the gift book of the year when it first published, and the images that grace its pages remain iconic. From the famous Afghan girl whose haunting green eyes stare out from the book’s cover, and her poignant story that captured the world’s interest, to award-winning photography culled from the Society’s vast archives, The Photographs offers readers an inside look at National Geographic and a sharp-eyed view of the world. The book showcases the skill and imagination of such notable Geographic photographers as David Doubilet, William Albert Allard, Sam Abell, Jim Stanfield, Jodi Cobb, Jim Brandenburg, David Alan Harvey, and many more. They share their techniques, as well as personal and colorful anecdotes about individual images and their adventures in the field—sometimes humorous, sometimes terrifying, always vividly compelling. Author Leah Bendavid-Val writes about the photographers’ achievements from technical, journalistic, and artistic perspectives.Five chapters cover core National Geographic themes—wildlife on land and water; cultures in the United States and around the world; and science, from astronomy to archaeology to the human senses. The photographs in each chapter capture rare moments in nature and the lives of animals, along with defining events in the lives of people everywhere. This exquisite collection is as elegant as it is timeless.",1426202911,9781426202919),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

Hers is a war fought in the dark, and like all wars, it has been costly. Friends have died, others have soured, and the rebellion that started out so strongly has broken into two embittered camps. When Bobbi is nearly killed by a surpise strike after a successful mission, it looks as though the Yathi may be the least of her problems.Meanwhile, Thomas Walken, held prisoner by the Yathi since his capture six years previous, awakens. Escaping from an alien installation, he must grapple with a body - and perhaps a mind - that is not his own, and try to reclaim the humanity which the Yathi’s have so vigorously tried to scrub from his mind. Hunted by the Mother of Systems, he aims to reconnect with Bobbi, but will she accept him as a man, or denounce him as a creation of the enemy?Packed with action, intrigue, and dark futuristic thrills, Gathering Ashes transports you to the very edge of a dangerously uncertain future.",English,English,ebook,,,"

","For nine seasons, Mary McDonough was part of one of the most beloved families in television history. Just ten years-old when she was cast as the pretty, wholesome middle child Erin, Mary grew up on the set of The Waltons, alternately embracing and rebelling against her good-girl onscreen persona. Now, as the first cast member to write about her experiences on the classic series, she candidly recounts the joys and challenges of growing up Walton--from her overnight transformation from a normal kid in a working class, Irish Catholic family, to a Hollywood child star, to the personal challenges that led her to take on a new role as an activist for women's body image issues.Touching, funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and always illuminating, Lessons from the Mountain is the story of everything Mary McDonough learned on her journey over--and beyond--that famous mountain.",English,English,Hardcover,,304 pages,"

Nikolai
I have been a contract killer since I was a boy. For years I savored the fear caused by my name, the trembling at the sight of my tattoos. The stars on my knees, the marks on my fingers, the dagger in my neck, all bespoke of danger. If you saw my eyes, it was the last vision you’d have. I have ever been the hunter, never the prey. With her, I am the mark and I am ready to lie down and let her capture me. Opening my small scarred heart to her brings out my enemies. I will carry out one last hit, but if they hurt her, I will bring the world down around their ears.
Daisy
I've been sheltered from the outside world all my life. Home-schooled and farm-raised, I’m so naive that my best friend calls me Pollyanna. I like to believe the best in people. Nikolai is part of this new life, and he’s terrifying to me. Not because his eyes are cold or my friend warns me away from him, but because he’s the only man that has ever seen the real me beneath the awkwardness. With him, my heart is at risk... and also, my life.",9780989247962,9780989247962,ebook,,270 pages,"

","Behold the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), today’s fastest growing carbohydrate-based religion. According to church founder Bobby Henderson, the universe and all life within it were created by a mystical and divine being: the Flying Spaghetti Monster. What drives the FSM’s devout followers, a.k.a. Pastafarians? Some say it’s the assuring touch from the FSM’s “noodly appendage.” Then there are those who love the worship service, which is conducted in pirate talk and attended by congregants in dashing buccaneer garb. Still others are drawn to the Church’s flimsy moral standards, religious holidays every Friday, or the fact that Pastafarian heaven is way cooler: Does your heaven have a Stripper Factory and a Beer Volcano? Intelligent Design has finally met its match–and it has nothing to do with apes or the Olive Garden of Eden.Within these pages, Bobby Henderson outlines the true facts– dispelling such malicious myths as evolution (“only a theory”), science (“only a lot of theories”), and whether we’re really descended from apes (fact: Humans share 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, but they share 99.9 percent with pirates!)See what impressively credentialed top scientists have to say:“If Intelligent Design is taught in schools, equal time should be given to the FSM theory and the non-FSM theory.”–Professor Douglas Shaw, Ph.D.“Do not be hypocritical. Allow equal time for other alternative ‘theories’ like FSMism, which is by far the tastier choice.”–J. Simon, Ph.D.“In my scientific opinion, when comparing the two theories, FSM theory seems to be more valid than classic ID theory.”–Afshin Beheshti, Ph.D.",0812976568,9780812976564),Paperback,,169 pages,"

But this year is different, and they soon find themselves tangled in teen love and family crisis. From the creators of Skim comes an investigation into the mysterious world of adults.Sure, Rose’s dad is still making cheesy and embarrassing jokes, but her mother is acting like she doesn’t even want to be there. Plus, being at the cottage isn’t just about going to the beach anymore. Now Rose and Windy are spend a lot of their time renting scary movies and spying on the teenagers who work at the corner store, as well as learning stuff about sex no one mentioned in health class.Pretty soon everything is messed up. Rose’s father leaves the cottage and returns to the city, and her mother becomes more and more withdrawn. While her family is falling to pieces, Rose focuses her attention on Dunc, a teenager working at the local corner store. When Jenny, Dunc’s girlfriend, claims to be pregnant, the girls realize that the teenagers are keeping just as many secrets as the adults in their lives.No one seems to want to talk about the things that matter. When the tension between Dunc and Jenny boils over, Jenny makes a desperate and destructive move and Rose's mother is galvanized into action. In the aftermath, nothing is completely resolved, but secrets have been aired, which means that things are at least a bit better for everyone.

","In this final volume of The Border Trilogy, two men marked by the boyhood adventures of All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing now stand together, in the still point between their vivid pasts and uncertain futures, to confront a country changing or already changed beyond recognition.In the fall of 1952, John Grady Cole and Billy Parham--nine years apart in age, yet with a kinship greater than perhaps they know--are cowboys on a New Mexico ranch encroached upon from the north, at Alamogordo, by the military. To the south, always on the horizon are the mountains of Mexico, looming over El Paso, Ciudad Juárez and all the cities of the plain. Bound by nature to horses and cattle and range, these two discover that ranchlife domesticity is compromised, for them and the men they work with, by a geometry of loss afflicting old and young alike, those who have survived it and anyone about to try. And what draws one of them across the border again and again, what would bind ""those disparate but fragile worlds,"" is a girl seized by ill fortune, and a love as dangerous as it is inevitable.This story of friendship and passion is enfolded in a narrative replete with character and place and event--a blind musician, a marauding pack of dogs, curio shops and ancient petroglyphs, a precocious shoe-shine boy, trail drives from the century before, midnight on the highway--and with landforms and wildlife and horses and men, most of all men and the women they love and mourn, men and their persistence and memories and dreams.With the terrible beauty of

","""An important and timely message about the biological roots of human kindness.""—Desmond Morris, author of The Naked ApeAre we our brothers' keepers? Do we have an instinct for compassion? Or are we, as is often assumed, only on earth to serve our own survival and interests? In this thought-provoking book, the acclaimed author of Our Inner Ape examines how empathy comes naturally to a great variety of animals, including humans. By studying social behaviors in animals, such as bonding, the herd instinct, the forming of trusting alliances, expressions of consolation, and conflict resolution, Frans de Waal demonstrates that animals–and humans–are ""preprogrammed to reach out."" He has found that chimpanzees care for mates that are wounded by leopards, elephants offer ""reassuring rumbles"" to youngsters in distress, and dolphins support sick companions near the water's surface to prevent them from drowning. From day one humans have innate sensitivities to faces, bodies, and voices; we've been designed to feel for one another.De Waal's theory runs counter to the assumption that humans are inherently selfish, which can be seen in the fields of politics, law, and finance, and which seems to be evidenced by the current greed-driven stock market collapse. But he cites the public's outrage at the U.S. government's lack of empathy in the wake of Hurricane Katrina as a significant shift in perspective–one that helped Barack Obama become elected and ushered in what may well become an Age of Empathy. Through a better understanding of empathy's survival value in evolution, de Waal suggests, we can work together toward a more just society based on a more generous and accurate view of human nature.Written in layman's prose with a wealth of anecdotes, wry humor, and incisive intelligence, The Age of Empathy is essential reading for our embattled times.",0307407764,9780307407764),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Après le remarqué Appel de l'Au-Delà, Bob Randall fait une nouvelle incursion dans la collection « Paniques » avec un roman bien étrange dans sa forme puisqu'il s'agit d'une succession de lettres que s'envoie les différents protagonistes du drame qui va se nouer au cours de quelques 200 pages du livre.Roman de suspense horrifique, à défaut d'être fantastique. Le Fan raconte une de ces histoires comme il ne peut, en fin de compte, en arriver qu'en Amérique : une actrice sur le retour se retrouve traquée par un admirateur mythomane qui ne va pas tarder à s'en prendre à l'entourage de l'objet de ses attentions. L'actrice ne va pas tarder à devenir la proie de ce psychopathe sans que la police ne puisse faire quoi que ce soit d'efficace pour empêcher les meurtres et les mutilations de tresser un réseau sanglant autour de celle qui a eu la malchance d'attirer l'attention de Douglas Breen, alias le Fan.Le découpage en lettres (avec en-tête personnalisés, s'il vous plait...) donne l'impression d'assister à la mise en place d'un puzzle machiavélique et lorsqu'on sait que ce roman a été écrit bien avant l'assassinat de John Lennon par un de ses admirateurs, on ne peut s'empêcher de penser que l'Amérique n'est décidément pas un pays comme les autres.",Edgar,(1978),Hard Cover,,242 pages,"

","Self-knowledge is the starting point of all true change in the individual and the world. The darkness of the subconscious and the ego can be uncovered to reveal the light of consciousness - the eternal spiritual part of us which contains all love, peace, inner faculties, and happiness, and which can be permanently awakened and increased.In Self-Knowledge for Spiritual Awakening by Belsebuub, discover the timeless and universal form of transcendental psychology found at the root of the world's great spiritual teachings and put it into practice immediately with key spiritual exercises such as awareness, self-observation, analysis of an ego, mantras, dream recall, and meditation.In over twenty-two chapters, Belsebuub outlines the multi-dimensional structure of the psyche beyond what modern science has been able to understand, and provides a hands-on guide to using eternal sacred practices to break free of depression, addiction, anger, fear, etc. and discover one's true self and purpose.The book is based on the hugely popular Searching Within online course by Belsebuub taken by tens of thousands of people worldwide.“Everyone has the ability to change far more radically than is usually assumed. Just because the information on how to do this is currently obscure or difficult to find in society doesn't mean that it cannot be done and that a huge and radical transformation cannot be achieved. What is needed are the correct techniques to use; if they are applied properly, you will be astonished at what you can do…”~ Belsebuub",English,English,ebook,,,"

","Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist is now a major television series on FOX. It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying.Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark.Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",B004V5180G,B004V5180G,Kindle Edition,,403 pages,"

","Fyodor Mihayloviç Dostoyevski (1821-1881): İlk romanı İnsancıklar’ın çarpıcı konusu ve farklı kurgusuyla dikkatleri çekti. İnsan ruhunun derinliklerini sergileyiş gücüyle önemli bir yazar olarak ün kazandı. Ancak daha sonra yayımlanan eserleri o dönemde fazla ilgi görmedi. Dostoyevski 1849’da I.Nikolay’ın baskıcı rejimine muhalif Petraşevski grubunun üyesi olduğu gerekçesiyle tutuklandı. Kurşuna dizilmek üzereyken cezası sürgün ve zorunlu askerliğe çevrildi. Sibirya sürgününden sonra yazdığı romanlarla tekrar eski ününe kavuştu. 1864’de Vremya dergisinde yayımladığı Yeraltından Notlar gerçek dünyadan kendini soyutlamış bir kişinin iç çatışmalarını ve hezeyanlarını konu alır. Bu roman Dostoyevski’nin daha sonra yazacağı büyük romanların ipuçlarını taşımaktadır.Nihal Yalaza Taluy (1900-1963): Cumhuriyet’in ilk kuşağının önde gelen Rusça çevirmenlerindendir.

","Already internationally acclaimed for his elegant, lucid writing on the most challenging notions in modern physics, Sean Carroll is emerging as one of the greatest humanist thinkers of his generation as he brings his extraordinary intellect to bear not only on Higgs bosons and extra dimensions but now also on our deepest personal questions.  Where are we? Who are we? Are our emotions, our beliefs, and our hopes and dreams ultimately meaningless out there in the void? Does human purpose and meaning fit into a scientific worldview?In short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, readers learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level--and then how each connects to the other.  Carroll's presentation of the principles that have guided the scientific revolution from Darwin and Einstein to the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe is dazzlingly unique.Carroll shows how an avalanche of discoveries in the past few hundred years has changed our world and what really matters to us. Our lives are dwarfed like never before by the immensity of space and time, but they are redeemed by our capacity to comprehend it and give it meaning.The Big Picture is an unprecedented scientific worldview, a tour de force that will sit on shelves alongside the works of Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Daniel Dennett, and E. O. Wilson for years to come.",English,English,Audible Audio,Unabridged,,"

Josef K., el protagonista, es acusado de un delito que nunca llegará a conocer y se ve envuelto en una maraña de la que no podrá salir. Nadie sabe quién dirige los engranajes que propician la detención y el posterior proceso. La situación en la que se encuentra el protagonista, a pesar de ser aparentemente absurda, se nos hace muy verosímil. En la novela aparecen abogados, jueces, ujieres, guardianes... que, en conjunto, dan una imagen impactante de los mecanismos de la Ley y del Estado. En Josef K. irá creciendo un sentimiento de culpa que conllevará su sumisión ante el proceso y que dará lugar al inesperado final del libro...

","It's first the story of two women in the 1980s, of gray-headed Mrs. Threadgoode telling her life story to Evelyn, who is in the sad slump of middle age. The tale she tells is also of two women -- of the irrepressibly daredevilish tomboy Idgie and her friend Ruth, who back in the thirties ran a little place in Whistle Stop, Alabama, a Southern kind of Cafe Wobegon offering good barbecue and good coffee and all kinds of love and laughter, even an occasional murder.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,522 pages,"

","The Merchant of Venice is a play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written between 1596 and 1598. Though classified as a comedy in the First Folio and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other romantic comedies, the play is perhaps most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and is best known for Shylock and the famous ""Hath not a Jew eyes?"" speech. Also notable is Portia's speech about ""the quality of mercy"".",English,English,,,160 pages,"

These thriving multimillionaires give advice designed to help average readers expand their wealth in the harsh economy. Firm steps towards financial literacy.From book cover:The world is facing many challenges and one of them is financial. The entitlement mentality is epidemic, creating people who expect their countries, employers, or families to take care of them. Donald Trump and Robert Kiyosaki, both successful businessmen, are natural teachers and have joined forces to address these challenges. They believe you cannot solve money problems with money. You can only solve money problems with financial education. Trump and Kiyosaki want to teach you to be rich.""Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.Teach him to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.""They each could have written a book on the subject, but they chose instead to write a book together because of their shared passion for education and their desire to bring emphasis to the importance of financial education. In addition they have designated a portion of the profits from each book to be donated to charitable and educational organizations that also support financial education.",English,English,Hardcover,First edition,345 pages,"

But to find the answer to that question, he must cooperate with one of the highly despised necromancers, men who practice black magic, sleep in graveyards and feed upon souls …The necromancer Koray, however, is far from what he expected. He is beautiful, stubborn, and possessed of a tongue sharp enough to cut down even the High Paladin himself. Koray is also possessed of a strength like nothing Sorin has ever encountered, and the power of the Goddess herself.It does not take them long to realize that solving a murder is the easiest challenge they must face, and in order to save a kingdom they must first unravel centuries of lies and misunderstandings.",English,English,ebook,,265 pages,"

When Nicky subsequently hangs himself, Chris sets out on a journey into his own and others' memories of the tragic events of 34 years before. Driven on by Nicky's firm belief in his father's innocence, he begins to doubt the offical version of those events and to question the conduct of several members of his own family.Then other present-day mysteries begin to dog his footsteps into the past and soon his search for the truth becomes a desperate struggle for his own survival.",0552142255,9780552142250),Paperback,,416 pages,"

As it turned out, the only way to make their parents get off their backs about trying to ""find someone"" was actually finding someone--with whom to put marriage for show. Mutsuki is strictly gay and has a boyfriend, while Shoko is a clinical case of emotional instability who's in no shape for a relationship. They've each found in the other a perfect partner for a sham marriage. Since the conspirators' parents know of their own child's undesirability, but not the spouse's, the union manages to please them. And while the newlyweds hope, in their own way, to live happily ever after, they inevitably come face to face with the fact that no marriage real or staged, is a fairy tale.",1932234012,9781932234015),Hardcover,,170 pages,"

","John Rechy's new novel is a return to the themes and scenes of his classic, best-selling City of Night and a bittersweet memorial to a lost world -- gay Los Angeles in the moment before AIDS. It is 1981, a summer night, and an unscripted ritual is about to take place. Young, beautiful Jesse is celebrating one year on the dazzling gay scene and plans to lose himself completely in its transient pleasures. He is joined by Dave, a leatherman bent on testing limits. A young hustler, an opera lover lost in fantasies of youth, a gang of teenagers looking for trouble -- as the Santa Ana winds breathe fire down the hills of Los Angeles, stirring up desires and violence, these men circle ever closer to a confrontation as devastating as it is inevitable. Lyrical, humorous, and compassionate, The Coming of the Night proves again that as a novelist and chronicler of gay life John Rechy has no equal. ""The question Rechy asks is still potent: Would you die for sex? Rechy's sizzling literary response, The Coming of Night is as exciting as it is chilling."" -- Pamela Warrick, Los Angeles Times; ""[Rechy] very nearly touches greatness . . . feeling his way toward that place within each of us where the ecstatic teeters on the edge of psychic abyss. . . .

Three months into his studies at the Black River Academy of Swordcraft and Spellcraft, Durren Flintrand is shocked by the news that from now on he'll be assigned to a party, and that his only hope of progressing beyond the lowly rank of level one is to succeed with his new companions. However, Durren has a secret that may make that impossible, and his three partners have problems of their own. Wizard Areinelimus is terrified of her own magic. Rogue Tia has no patience at all with others. And warrior Hule is just an idiot. In fact, when a disembodied, floating eyeball is your most competent party member, you know you have serious problems. To stand a chance of succeeding, they need to work together, and that means learning to tolerate each other, while surviving a world of angry rat people, murderous sorcerers and homicidal unicorns. But even if they can somehow find a way to get along, dark and ancient forces are stirring, ones no level one students should ever have to confront...

","The life of a spinster in Victorian London isn't an easy one on the best of days, but such a life becomes infinitely more complicated when said spinster is ""soulless"" - a preternatural bridging the gap between the natural and supernatural worlds. Miss Alexia Tarabotti has this unique distinction, and when she is assailed at a formal gathering by a rove vampire, an encounter that results in the death of the half-starved creature, her circumstances become exponentially more complicated indeed! Now caught up in an intrigue with life or death stakes, Alexia must rely on all her talents to outmatch the forces conspiring against her, but it may be the man who has caught her eye - Lord Conall Maccon - and their budding flirtation that truly drives her to her wit's end!",031618201X,9780316182010),Paperback,,228 pages,"

","HE'S FOUGHT FOR HIS LANDS, HIS MARRIAGE, AND HIS KING. THE FIGHT FOR HIS SOUL IS JUST BEGINNING.""He's alive."" With these two words, the world as Sebastian knows it will never be the same. The news that his cousin Konrad-his sworn enemy and abusive first husband of his beloved wife Adela-means that his marriage is no longer valid. Even the high king Charlemagne cannot challenge the decision of a powerful emerging Church. Sebastian can do nothing but watch as the love of his life enters a convent.This epic tale of love and honor sweeps the reader back into the fascinating 9th century world of the incomparable Charlemagne. No mere military account of conquests and battles, this is a rich, well-rounded period drama and an authentic recreation of the early medieval world. Book I of this three-volume series was highly recommended by the Historical Novel Society. The second novel does not disappoint, as the hero is sent from the king's Rhineland court to three preeminent capitals of the 9th-century medieval world: Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Baghdad. Through his courage under pressure, original ideas, and steadfast service to the king Sebastian has become one of Charlemagne's twelve paladins, a high honor, but the cost is also high. He loses his beloved wife and family, becomes entangled with other beautiful women, and is submerged into a foreign world of intrigue and betrayal. Becoming a paladin changes Sebastian from a young man of faith and character into a hard-bitten warrior in a ruthless world. Thus the latter part of the novel presents a swirling adventure but also a parable of the ruin and redemption of a professional soldier.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,380 pages,"

In the world of the living and the dead, only the dead survive…



The way carbon atoms need intense heat and pressure to change structure and become a diamond is the same way some girls need mind mapping and genetic modification to become unstoppable weapons. As in love, nothing comes easy. And nothing in life will ever be the same again. Such is the nature of cause and effect in genetics. 

In the wake of an horrific, inevitable tragedy, everyone is forced to be someone they’re not. Brayden sinks into the Vegas nightlife learning hard lessons in love and sex; Georgia struggles to cope with the mutant changes taking place in her, specifically the death of her emotions; Dr. Holland must correct his own genetic cocktail lest he descend into a madness more reminiscent of his earlier, more homicidal days; and Margaret and Christian must face their own dire truths, not only about who they are becoming as a couple, but if they will even have a family once the truth about Abby comes out.

Weapon is very much a book of love and humanity, the will to endure the unthinkable, the necessity of friendship in the darkest of times and what it means to prepare yourself for the backlash of a reckless life. When love is a choice, and life is a choice, but madness and torture head toward secrecy and conspiracy, what you have is a riveting tale that begs the question: can normalcy and paranormal power co-exist? Especially if that power is otherworldly and indomitable, something most humans could never comprehend? With some slight of hand, a rash of deception, and some life-threatening choices that seem impossible in retrospect, the heart-stopping fifth novel in the ground-breaking Swann Series begins. 

Note to Reader: Before you purchase this book, read the short author interview below. Due to mature content, Weapon is recommended for ages 15 and up.


INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR



Q – The events in Masochist flip the script, so to speak. Can we expect to see Abby again?
A – If I’ve learned one thing from reading over a thousand books, it’s that you want to keep your audience on edge. You want to be unpredictable, do the unthinkable. Nothing for my characters is easy. Weapon is no different. As the series progresses, the stakes intensify; if the characters can’t keep up, failure overwhelms them. Failure sometimes equals death. Weapon continues the Swann Series tradition by being a story of ascension. Over the last three books, this series has delicately embraced the paranormal, the genetically complex, the downright insane. So will we see Abby again? Maybe more than you think, or perhaps not at all. I can promise you this, what lie ahead…you will never see it coming.


Q – You use Dulce Air Force Base as a background for Weapon. What inspired this setting?
A – There’s so much conspiracy surrounding Dulce AFB, especially in 1979 when a war broke out between the military and, well…something else. Sixty-seven military personnel died; three survived. Phil Schneider, grievously wounded, survived. His wounds were consistent with his story, but his story was impossible to the logical mind. Schneider was told the only way to avoid being suicided was to tell the truth to as many people as he could, a common safety measure for whistle-blowers. Schneider was later found dead in his apartment after thirteen murder attempts.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,495 pages,"

","Commemorating the 150th anniversary of one of the most beloved classics of children's literature, this illustrated edition presents Alice like you've never seen her before.In 1865, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, an Oxford mathematician and Anglican deacon, published a story about a little girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole. Thus was the world first introduced to Alice and her pseudonymous creator, Lewis Carroll. This beautiful new edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland features rarely seen illustrations by Salvador Dalí that illuminate the surreal yet curiously logical and mathematical realm into which Alice famously falls.In an informative and wide-ranging introduction, Carroll expert Mark Burstein discusses Dalí's connections with Carroll, his treatment of the symbolic figure of Alice, and the mathematical nature of Wonderland. In addition, mathematician Thomas Banchoff reflects on the friendship he shared with Dalí and explores the mathematical undercurrents in Dalí's work.",0691170029,9780691170022),Hardcover,,136 pages,"

"," Robert Schneider siedelt seinen Roman über das verkannte musikalische Genie Johannes Elias Alder in dem rauhen, vorarlbergischen Bergdorf Eschberg an, dessen Einwohner nur über alltägliche Dinge sprechen, sich ansonsten in Andeutungen ergehen und im Zweifelsfall lieber schweigen als reden. Elias, der von Geburt an anders ist als die Bauern, wird von diesen Menschen gemieden und von seiner eigenen Mutter abgelehnt. So wie die drei Feuer, die das Dorf nach und nach auslöschen, so löscht die Enttäuschung über drei wichtige Menschen (Mutter, Vater und die unerwiderte Liebe zu Elsbeth) schließlich das Leben des zweiundzwanzigjährigen Elias aus. Dieser Roman, der vordergründig sehr nüchtern, ja fast wie eine Chronik erzählt ist, bezieht seine Atmosphäre aus winzigen Details -- der Hut des Vaters als einziger Trost für den kleinen Jungen, die sparsame, aber umso deutlicher entsetzte Reaktion des jugendlichen Elias, als er sieht wie sein Vater einen Menschen umbringt. Das Buch hat mich von Anfang bis zum Ende in seinen Bann gezogen. Ich habe es nicht -- wie Elias Canetti schrieb -- mit Freude gelesen, sondern mit einer großen Beklemmung und gleichzeitiger Begeisterung für den einzigartigen Stil Schneiders. Die Geschichte des Musikers Johannes Elias Alder wird mich sicher immer begleiten. --Cornelia Rediger ",3379015180,9783379015189),Paperback,,204 pages,"

","""The Game..."" makes for strange bedfellows. Local gangster Dante (Jack Boy) knows more than anybody how dangerous and ruthless the streets can be. But against his better instincts allows himself to fall for a local female gangster named Alinna. Considered to be somewhat of a competitor to Dante because she leads her own all female crew. Alinna too, is very well aware of the dangers that come with letting feelings get in the way of business. But like Dante, decides to embrace the attraction anyway. That however proves to be a mistake. When she discovers Dante is two-timing her with a female gang unit officer. But unlike what she has with Dante, this relationship is more about lust and power. Or better yet the officers lust for it. While both get pleasure from this arrangement, she also gains intel. Which lead to major busts that fuel her quick ascension within the department. However her world is suddenly rocked when she discovers she's pregnant with Dante's child! Now they have something that binds them together forever... and something that complicates not just her job but also Dante's relationship with Alina! But with Alina being onto Dante's cheating ways, and the officer being willing to eliminate any and all threats to her burgeoning career. Not to mention the threat of the streets discovering Dante's Serpico ties. Could he end up losing everything in the end? ",English,English,Kindle Edition,,222 pages,"

","India is home to Bollywood - the largest film industry in the world. Movie theaters are said to be the ""temples of modern India,"" with Bombay producing nearly 800 films per year that are viewed by roughly 11 million people per day. In Bollywood Cinema, Vijay Mishra argues that Indian film production and reception is shaped by the desire for national community and a pan-Indian popular culture. Seeking to understand Bollywood according to its own narrative and aesthetic principles and in relation to a global film industry, he views Indian cinema through the dual methodologies of postcolonial studies and film theory. Mishra discusses classics such as Mother India (1957) and Devdas (1935) and recent films including Ram Lakhan (1989) and Khalnayak (1993), linking their form and content to broader issues of national identity, epic tradition, popular culture, history, and the implications of diaspora.",0415930154,9780415930154),Paperback,,296 pages,"

","The Basis for the Major Motion Picture Rosewater, Directed By Jon StewartWhen Maziar Bahari left London in June 2009 to cover Iran’s presidential election, he assured his pregnant fiancée, Paola, that he’d be back in just a few days, a week at most. Little did he know, as he kissed her good-bye, that he would spend the next three months in Iran’s most notorious prison, enduring brutal interrogation sessions at the hands of a man he knew only by his smell: Rosewater.For the Bahari family, wars, coups, and revolutions are not distant concepts but intimate realities they have suffered for generations: Maziar’s father was imprisoned by the shah in the 1950s, and his sister by Ayatollah Khomeini in the 1980s. Alone in his cell at Evin Prison, fearing the worst, Maziar draws strength from his memories of the courage of his father and sister in the face of torture, and hears their voices speaking to him across the years. He dreams of being with Paola in London, and imagines all that she and his rambunctious, resilient eighty-four-year-old mother must be doing to campaign for his release. During the worst of his encounters with Rosewater, he silently repeats the names of his loved ones, calling on their strength and love to protect him and praying he will be released in time for the birth of his first child.A riveting, heart-wrenching memoir, Then They Came for Me offers insight into the past seventy years of regime change in Iran, as well as the future of a country where the democratic impulses of the youth continually clash with a government that becomes more totalitarian with each passing day. An intimate and fascinating account of contemporary Iran, it is also the moving and wonderfully written story of one family’s extraordinary courage in the face of repression.",1400069467,9781400069460),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","'I really think I have done it ingeniously and with a very complicated interweaving of truth and fiction.' So wrote Dickens of David Copperfield (1850), the novel he called his 'favourite child'. Through his hero Dickens draws openly on his own life, as David Copperfield recalls his experiences from childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Rosa Dartle, Dora, Steerforth and Uriah Heep are among the characters who focus the hero's sexual and emotional drives, and Mr Micawber, a portrait of Dickens's own father, evokes the mixture of love, nostalgia and guilt that, put together, make this Dickens's most quoted and best-loved novel.",0451522923,9780451522924),Paperback,,870 pages,"

","'A sombra do vento' é uma narrativa de ritmo eletrizante, escrita em uma prosa ora poética, ora irônica. O enredo mistura gêneros como o romance de aventuras de Alexandre Dumas, a novela gótica de Edgar Allan Poe e os folhetins amorosos de Victor Hugo. Ambientado na Barcelona franquista da primeira metade do século XX, entre os últimos raios de luz do modernismo e as trevas do pós-guerra, o romance de Zafón é uma obra sedutora, comovente e impossível de largar. Tudo começa em Barcelona, em 1945. Daniel Sempere está completando 11 anos. Ao ver o filho triste por não conseguir mais se lembrar do rosto da mãe já morta, seu pai lhe dá um presente inesquecível; em uma madrugada fantasmagórica, leva-o a um misterioso lugar no coração do centro histórico da cidade, o Cemitério dos Livros Esquecidos. O lugar, conhecido de poucos barceloneses, é uma biblioteca secreta e labiríntica que funciona como depósito para obras abandonadas pelo mundo, à espera de que alguém as descubra. É lá que Daniel encontra um exemplar de 'A Sombra do Vento', do também barcelonês Julián Carax. O livro desperta no jovem e sensível Daniel um enorme fascínio por aquele autor desconhecido e sua obra, que ele descobre ser vasta. Obcecado, Daniel começa então uma busca pelos outros livros de Carax e, para sua surpresa, descobre que alguém vem queimando sistematicamente todos os exemplares de todos os livros que o autor já escreveu.",856028009X,9788560280094),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Black Rock White City is a novel about the damages of war, the limits of choice, and the hope of love. During a hot Melbourne summer Jovan’s cleaning work at a bayside hospital is disrupted by acts of graffiti and violence becoming increasingly malevolent. For Jovan the mysterious words that must be cleaned away dislodge the poetry of the past. He and his wife Suzana were forced to flee Sarajevo and the death of their children.  Intensely human, yet majestic in its moral vision, Black Rock White City is an essential story of Australia’s suburbs now, of displacement and immediate threat, and the unexpected responses of two refugees as they try to reclaim their dreams. It is a breathtaking roar of energy that explores the immigrant experience with ferocity, beauty and humour.",1921924837,9781921924835),Paperback,,246 pages,"

"," Erika I was told that dreams were our heart’s desires. My nightmares, however, became my obsession. His name is Michael Crist. My boyfriend’s older brother is like that scary movie that you peek through your hand to watch. He is handsome, strong, and completely terrifying. The star of his college’s basketball team and now gone pro, he’s more concerned with the dirt on his shoe than me. But I noticed him.I saw him. I heard him. The things that he did, and the deeds that he hid…For years, I bit my nails, unable to look away. Now, I’ve graduated high school and moved on to college, but I haven’t stopped watching Michael. He’s bad, and the dirt I’ve seen isn’t content to stay in my head anymore. Because he’s finally noticed me. MichaelHer name is Erika Fane, but everyone calls her Rika.My brother’s girlfriend grew up hanging around my house and is always at our dinner table. She looks down when I enter a room and stills when I am close. I can always feel the fear rolling off of her, and while I haven’t had her body, I know that I have her mind. That’s all I really want anyway. Until my brother leaves for the military, and I find Rika alone at college. In my city. Unprotected. The opportunity is too good to be true as well as the timing. Because you see, three years ago she put a few of my high school friends in prison, and now they’re out. We’ve waited. We’ve been patient.

Hell is the basement of an industrial warehouse where the rich, bored and psychotic buy their pleasure at the cost of innocent men and women. I will take these bastards down, but first, I have to let myself be sold… My life as a sexual slave should destroy me.

","One of the most popular and most quoted books in English, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was the creation of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832–1898), a distinguished scholar, mathematician and author who wrote under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. Written for young readers but enjoyed equally by adults, the fantastic tale transformed children's literature, liberating it from didactic constraints.The story is deeply but gently satiric, enlivened with an imaginative plot and brilliant use of nonsense, as it relates Alice's adventures in a bizarre, topsy-turvey land underground. There she encounters a cast of strange characters and fanciful beasts, including the White Rabbit, March Hare, and Mad Hatter, the sleepy Dormouse and grinning Cheshire Cat,the Mock Turtle, the dreadful Queen of Hearts, and unusual creatures.Sir John Tenniel's complete original illustrations bring the story and all the characters to life in this beloved classic that has delighted readers and listeners since its first publication in 1865.--back cover",0486275434,9780486275437),Paperback,Dover Thrift Editions (US/CAN/UK),96 pages,"

The letters that follow are filled with the stories of Wang’s previous lives—from escaping a marriage to a spirit bride, to being a slave on the run from Genghis Khan, to living as a fisherman during the Opium Wars, and being a teenager on the Red Guard during the cultural revolution—bound to his mysterious “soulmate,” spanning one thousand years of betrayal and intrigue.As the letters continue to appear seemingly out of thin air, Wang becomes convinced that someone is watching him—someone who claims to have known him for over one thousand years.

She had been Will’s girl since their junior year in high school, followed him to college, and married him soon after graduation.  In every respect, they were a loving and successful couple, until a series of missteps shattered all of Bryson’s truths. Maybe their life was nothing more than smoke and mirrors. A performance that was never based in reality.  Hart was barely an acquaintance. He and Bryson shared one brief moment during senior prom, full of friction and heat that ignited a spark. But that night Bryson walked away and Hart let her go.  Years later, twisted fate brings Bryson and Hart together again, causing her to wonder if this is her second chance at once in a lifetime.

","A young New Yorker grieving his mother's death is pulled into a gritty underworld of art and wealth in this ""extraordinary"" and beloved Pulitzer Prize winner that ""connects with the heart as well as the mind"" (Stephen King, New York Times Book Review).Theo Decker, a 13-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by a longing for his mother, he clings to the one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into a wealthy and insular art community.As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love -- and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.The Goldfinch is a mesmerizing, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention.

","There is beauty in darkness.  Dark Strands is a collection of poetry by JD Estrada where the more shadowy aspects of humanity are explored. As humans, there are many sides to us… and some of them aren’t so pretty.  Still, the statement ""life is beautiful"" is true, even in the not so lovely parts. Anger, sadness, despair, and madness can all have their moment to shine because they can all happen. Experiencing any of these emotions is human… so why not enjoy them in verse as well.  Care to come in and enjoy a slice of the dark? Don’t worry, the worst that can happen is that you enjoy it.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,34 pages,"

","Premda je Dickens ovu priču napisao kako bi zaradio novac za otplatu duga, njezin je uspjeh bio instantan – 6 000 primjeraka prodano je već prvog vikenda. Do danas je ostala jedna od najpopularnijih božićnih priča. Glavni lik je Ebenezer Scrooge koji je postao jedan od najpoznatijih škrtaca u književnosti, ali i simbol promjene duha. Scrooge mrzi Božić i ujedno svako veselje i običaj povezan s njim. Ne želi taj dan provesti u krugu obitelji, potplaćenom zaposleniku daje slobodan dan samo zato što je takav običaj, te grubo odbija dati donaciju za hranu siromašnima. Na Badnju ga večer posjećuje duh pokojnog poslovnog partnera Jacoba Marleya koji svoju zloću plaća okovima u posmrtnom životu. Marley ga obavijesti o skorašnjem posjetu triju duhova: prošlosti, sadašnjosti i budućnosti…Koliki je značaj ovog djela govori i zanimljiva činjenica da je Disneyjev lik Tvrdice (ujak Paje Patka) kreiran upravo po liku Ebenezera Scroogea, čak se izvorno zove Uncle Scrooge!",9537161579,9789537161576),Hardcover,Večernjakova biblioteka.

","As a young student, John Milton fantasized about bringing the poetic elocution of Homer and Virgil to the English language. Milton realized this dream with his graceful, sonorous Paradise Lost, now considered the most influential epic poem in English literature.A retelling of the biblical story of mankind's fall from grace, Milton's epic opens shortly after the dramatic expulsion of Satan and his army of angels from Heaven. What follows is a cosmic battle between good and evil that ranges across vast, splendid tracts of time and space, from the wild abyss of Chaos and the fiery lake of Hell to the Gate of Heaven and God's newly created paradise, the Garden of Eden. Controversy still swirls around Milton's magnificent and sympathetic characterization of Satan, a portrait so compelling that many critics have maintained that he is the true hero of the story.",1593080956,9781593080952),Paperback,,442 pages,"

","""If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write."" In 1999, Stephen King began to write about his craft -- and his life. By midyear, a widely reported accident jeopardized the survival of both. And in his months of recovery, the link between writing and living became more crucial than ever.Rarely has a book on writing been so clear, so useful, and so revealing. On Writing begins with a mesmerizing account of King's childhood and his uncannily early focus on writing to tell a story. A series of vivid memories from adolescence, college, and the struggling years that led up to his first novel, Carrie, will afford readers a fresh and often very funny perspective on the formation of a writer. King next turns to the basic tools of his trade -- how to sharpen and multiply them through use, and how the writer must always have them close at hand. He takes the reader through crucial aspects of the writer's art and life, offering practical and inspiring advice on everything from plot and character development to work habits and rejection.Serialized in the New Yorker to vivid acclaim, On Writing culminates with a profoundly moving account of how King's overwhelming need to write spurred him toward recovery, and brought him back to his life.Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower -- and entertain -- everyone who reads it.--front flap",0684853523,9780684853529),Hardcover,US / CAN,288 pages,"

","Part of a small demon lair in North Las Vegas, tattooist Harper Wallis lives a pretty simple life. That changes overnight when she discovers that her psychic mate, or ‘anchor’, is a guy who’s rumored to be the most powerful demon in existence. Compelling, full of secrets and armed with raw sexuality, Knox Thorne is determined to claim her as his anchor, creating a psychic bond that will prevent their inner demons from ever turning rogue. The billionaire also wants Harper in his bed. She’s not so sure she wants either of those things. No one seems to know what breed of demon Knox is, only that he’s more dangerous than anything she’s ever before encountered. But he refuses to walk away. And when an unknown danger starts closing in on Harper, it seems that Knox is the only one who can keep her safe.  As Prime of his Las Vegas lair and a successful businessman, Knox Thorne is used to being in control. He’s also used to people fearing and obeying him.

Knox is used to getting what he wants, and he wants Harper. He’ll have her, and he’ll keep her safe from the threat that looms over her. Because Knox protects what’s his.

When I made the wish, I just wanted a do-over. Another chance to make things right. I never, in a million years, thought it might actually come true... 

Sixteen-year-old Ellison Sparks is having a serious case of the Mondays. She gets a ticket for running a red light, she manages to take the world’s worst school picture, she bombs softball try-outs and her class election speech (note to self: never trust a cheerleader when she swears there are no nuts in her bake-sale banana bread), and to top it all off, Tristan, her gorgeous rocker boyfriend suddenly dumps her. For no good reason!As far as Mondays go, it doesn’t get much worse than this. And Ellie is positive that if she could just do it all over again, she would get it right. So when she wakes up the next morning to find she’s reliving the  exact same day, she knows what she has to do: stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her. But it seems no matter how many do-overs she gets or how hard Ellie tries to repair her relationship, Tristan always seems bent set on ending it. Will Ellie ever figure out how to fix this broken day? Or will she be stuck in this nightmare of a Monday forever?From the author of 52 Reasons to Hate My Father and The Unremembered trilogy comes a hilarious and heartwarming story about second (and third and fourth and fifth) chances. Because sometimes it takes a whole week of Mondays to figure out what you really want.",B01AGIOE16,B01AGIOE16,Kindle Edition,,465 pages,"

","Of all Jane Austen's novels, Persuasion is widely regarded as the most moving. It is the story of a second chance.Anne Elliot, daughter of a snobbish, spendthrift Sir Walter Elliot, is a woman of a quiet charm and deep feelings. When she was nineteen, she fell in love with - and was engaged to - a naval officer, the fearless and headstrong Captain Wentworth. But the young man had no fortune, and Anne allowed herself to be persuaded, against her profoundest instinct, to give him up.Now, at twenty-seven, and believing that she has lost her bloom, Anne is startled to learn that Captain Wentworth has returned to the neighborhood, a rich man and still unwed. Her never-diminished love is muffled by her pride. Even worse, he appears to be infatuated by the flighty and pretty Louisa Musgrove.What happens as Anne and Wentworth are thrown together in the social world of Bath - and as an eager new suitor appears for Anne - is touchingly and wittily told in a masterpiece that is also one of the most entrancing novels in the English language.",0679409866,9780679409861),Hardcover,,260 pages,"

","""Ein wenig Leben"" handelt von der lebenslangen Freundschaft zwischen vier Männern in New York, die sich am College kennengelernt haben. Jude St. Francis, brillant und enigmatisch, ist die charismatische Figur im Zentrum der Gruppe – ein aufopfernd liebender und zugleich innerlich zerbrochener Mensch. Wie in ein schwarzes Loch werden die Freunde in Judes dunkle, schmerzhafte Welt hineingesogen, deren Ungeheuer nach und nach hervortreten. ""Ein wenig Leben"" ist ein rauschhaftes, mit kaum fasslicher Dringlichkeit erzähltes Epos über Trauma, menschliche Güte und Freundschaft als wahre Liebe. Es begibt sich an die dunkelsten Orte, an die Literatur sich wagen kann, und bricht dabei immer wieder zum hellen Licht durch.",3446254714,9783446254718),Hardcover,,960 pages,"

","How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.Eyal provides readers with:• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.• Actionable steps for building products people love.• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.",1591847788,9781591847786),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","Imagine uma época em que os livros configurem uma ameaça ao sistema, uma sociedade onde eles são proibidos. Para exterminá-los, basta chamar os bombeiros - profissionais que outrora se dedicavam à extinção de incêndios, mas que agora são os responsáveis pela manutenção da ordem, queimando publicações e impedindo que o conhecimento se dissemine como praga. Para coroar a alienação em que vive essa nova sociedade, as casa são dotadas de televisores que ocupam paredes inteiras de cômodos, e exibem ""famílias"" com as quais se pode dialogar, como se estas fossem de fatos reais.Este é o cenário em que vive Guy Montag, bombeiro que atravessa série crise ideológica. Sua esposa passa o dia entretida com seus ""parentes televisivos"", enquanto ele trabalha arduamente. Sua vida vazia é transformada quando ele conhece a vizinha Clarisse, uma adolescente que reflete sobre o mundo à sua volta e que o instiga a fazer o mesmo. O sumiço misterioso de Clarisse leva Montag a se rebelar contra a política estabelecida, e ele passa a esconder livros em sua própria casa. Denunciado por sua ousadia, é obrigado a mudar de tática e a buscar aliados na luta pela preservação do pensamento e da memória.Um clássico de Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 é não só uma crítica à repressão política mas também à superficialidade da era da imagem, sintomático do século XX e que ainda parece não esmorecer.Introdução por: Manuel da Costa Pinto, escritor do prefácio desta edição de Fahrenheit 451.",8525052248,9788525052247),Paperback,Biblioteca Azul,215 pages,"

The screaming match she had with her grandmother was the reason she went to church. What she found there was the Reason she is alive today.With raw vulnerability, this hard rock princess tells her own story of physical abuse, drug use, suicide attempts, and more--and her ultimate salvation. She asks the hard questions so many young people are asking--Why am I here? Why am I empty? Why should I go on living?--showing readers that beyond the temporary highs and the soul-crushing lows there is a reason they exist and a purpose for their lives. She not only gives readers a peek down the rocky path that led her to become a vocalist in a popular hardcore band, but she shows them that the same God is guiding their steps today.",0801016738,9780801016738),Paperback,,202 pages,"

Jimmy, forse l'unico uomo rimasto in vita, deve proteggersi da numerosi animali feroci, risultato di mutazioni e di incontrollati esperimenti di ingegneria genetica. Jimmy si fa chiamare l'Uomo delle Nevi dai membri di una tribù di pacifici mutanti di innata infantile innocenza, i Craker. L'uomo gli insegna le elementari regole della sopravvivenza e tenta di spiegargli i segreti della natura ma, a causa del loro limitato sviluppo, deve usare concetti semplici e metafore di facile comprensione. La genesi, ad opera del creatore Crake, gli viene spiegata come fosse una fiaba e i Craker imparano a ringraziare la divinità femminile Oryx per la prosperità a loro concessa.

","Městečko, kde se zastavil čas je jedna z nejpůvabnějších a nejhodnotnějších Hrabalových próz, žánrově zařaditelná nejspíš jako novela. Poprvé vyšla v roce 1978 pod názvem Městečko, ve kterém se zastavil čas v exilovém nakladatelství Comenius v Innsbrucku. Jde v podstatě o zbeletrizovanou historii dvacátého století – jak se promítala do událostí v nymburském pivovaře, kde byl Hrabalův otec správcem a kde spisovatel prožil podstatnou část dětství. Protagonisty textu jsou opět bratři Francin a Pepin, čtenářům tak dobře známí například z Postřižin, jež ostatně mají v tomto textu původ. Celá knížka je tak trochu autorovým nostalgickým povzdechem nad „koncem starých časů“. Popis života v idylických dvacátých a třicátých letech dvacátého století je vystřídán popisem časů poúnorových, kdy se komunistický režim – pochopitelně negativně – podepíše i na životě.",0887812139,9780887812132),Hardcover,,152 pages,"

","Kinas dragningskraft blir allt större. Västerländska företag investerar i landet och dess gåtfulla kultur lockar till sig turister. Nu kommer Kinas historia, den första moderna sammanställningen om detta stora och häpnadsväckande land.Fokus ligger på det moderna Kina, men skildringen rör sig från forntiden till våra dagar. Hans Hägerdal börjar i de äldsta kinesiska civilisationerna, riksenandet 221 f Kr, de sju huvudepokerna i det kejserliga Kina och går vidare med den imperialistiska framryckningen på 1800-talet med förlorade krig, upprorsrörelser och uppluckring av det gamla samhället. Revolutionen 1911-12 blev starten på en borgerlig republik. 1949 tog Mao Zedong över makten vilket inledde en kontroversiell period med en kommunistisk folkrepublik.Boken berättar även om den kulturella och intellektuella utvecklingen, om ideologiska och filosofiska tankeströmningar.

","Dark and compassionate, graceful yet raw, ""Undressing the Moon"" explores the seams between childhood and adulthood, between love and loss...At thirty, Piper Kincaid feels too young to be dying. Cancer has eaten away her strength; she'd be alone but for a childhood friend who's come home by chance. Yet with all the questions of her future before her, she's adrift in the past, remembering the fateful summer she turned fourteen and her life changed forever. Her nervous father's job search seemed stalled for good, as he hung around the house watching her mother's every move. What he and Piper had both dreaded at last came to pass: Her restless, artistic mother, who smelled of lilacs and showed Piper beauty, finally left. With no one to rely on, Piper struggled to hold on to what was important. She had a brother who loved her and a teacher enthralled with her potential. But her mother's absence, her father's distance, and a volatile secret threatened her delicate balance. Now Piper is once again left with the jagged pieces of a shattered life. If she is ever going to put herself back together, she'll have to begin with the summer that broke them all...",0758238762,9780758238764),Paperback,,278 pages,"

","Shocking and controversial when it was first published in 1939, Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize-winning epic remains his undisputed masterpiece. Set against the background of dust bowl Oklahoma and Californian migrant life, it tells of the Joad family, who, like thousands of others, are forced to travel West in search of the promised land. Their story is one of false hopes, thwarted desires and broken dreams, yet out of their suffering Steinbeck created a drama that is intensely human, yet majestic in its scale and moral vision; an eloquent tribute to the endurance and dignity of the human spirit.",English,English,Paperback,,476 pages,"

As confidant to the famous Maid of Donremy, the duke should have been a hero. Instead, he was locked up by his king and called a traitor.But this betrayal no longer matters to the duke. What does matter is a promise he made to a young girl-to the Maid. For the Maid had been but a girl once-a girl with a name and her own astonishing story-as he had been but a boy. He knows that one day, when he is old and frail, another girl, a poisoner, will come looking for him. And he will keep his promise-he will reveal to her the Maid's mystery so that destiny will be fulfilled.When Ankarette, the queen's poisoner, arrives in enemy territory on a quest for the Maid's magic sword, little does she realize that she's been chosen-or that the duke's story will alter the fabric of her mission-and the impending war about to tear two kingdoms apart.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,302 pages,"

","Alexander Issaievich Soljenitsin nasceu em 1918, em Rostov, nas margens do Dom. O pai era ""colarinho-branco"", a mãe, professora primária. Soljenitsin licencia-se em Matemática na Universidade de Rostov e pouco depois é chamado para o Exército Vermelho. Em 1942, com 24 anos, é promovido ao posto de capitão. Em 1945 é preso sob acusação de ter feito comentários pejorativos acerca de Estaline. Os oito anos seguintes passa-os, nessa situação, em diversos campos de trabalho. O campo no qual - e, com ele, o seu herói Ivan Denisovich Shukhov - cumpre grande parte da sua pena ficava na região de Caraganda, no Norte do Cazaquistão.Em 1953, ano da morte de Estaline, Soljenitsin é libertado. Contudo, só depois de passar mais três anos no exílio e de Kruchtchev ter denunciado a política de Estaline, é que o seu caso é revisto e a sentença anulada. Em 1962, o nome de Soljenitsin aparece pela primeira vez nas páginas duma revista literária russa narrando, com uma autenticidade que assentava na sua própria experiência, a história de um dia vivido por um simples carpinteiro de aldeia num dos campos de trabalho da Sibéria, no período de Estaline.Banido da União dos Escritores Soviéticos, é, no entanto, galardoado com o Prémio Nobel da Literatura de 1970.",Portuguese,Portuguese,Paperback,"Livros de Bolso,  #33",198 pages,"

First published in French as a serial in 1909, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a riveting story that revolves around the young, Swedish Christine Daaé. Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster. Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations. Despite this, it remains a remarkable piece of Gothic horror literature in and of itself, deeper and darker than any version that follows.",0880299053,9780880299053),Hardcover,,264 pages,"

When Lara goes to the highlands to set the cattle out to graze, she finds the mare in the process of a difficult birth. Lara vows to take care of the foal as a dying promise to the gray mare, and with the help of a childless milk-cow, she cares for the spindly-legged filly. But just when she is confident that the foal can survive, a rival clan captures them both, and throws Lara's life into turmoil. When the filly is eventually given to a titled baron in the castle town of Athenry, Lara, determined to stay with the horse no matter what, goes along. Together, she and her beloved horse face seemingly insurmountable challenges, but all along Lara keeps two things in mind. One day, she will manage to flee, and will set off in search of the family that she was taken from. And she will not leave without her silver mare. ",0142402303,9780142402306),Paperback,,144 pages,"

","21 hrs. 19 minCyril Avery is not a real Avery or at least that’s what his adoptive parents tell him. And he never will be. But if he isn’t a real Avery, then who is he?Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamourous and dangerous Julian Woodbead.At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from – and over his three score years and ten, will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country and much more.In this, Boyne's most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. The Heart's Invisible Furies is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.",0857523481,9780857523488),Paperback,,592 pages,"

","With H.G. Wells’ other novels, The War of the Worlds was one of the first and greatest works of science fiction ever to be written. Even long before man had learned to fly, H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders, from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a Heat-Ray. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies, and by manipulating two terrifying machines – the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine – they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them, and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians, in spite of their superior intelligence, have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.",0330243322,9780330243322),Mass Market Paperback,,192 pages,"

","In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance—beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone—a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.",0002247399,9780002247399),Hardcover,First Edition,959 pages,"

","The only American edition of the cult classic novel.A vicious fifteen-year-old droog is the central character of this 1963 classic. In Anthony Burgess's nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. When the state undertakes to reform Alex to ""redeem"" him, the novel asks, ""At what cost?""

","For thirty years, Peter Singer's Practical Ethics has been the classic introduction to applied ethics. For this third edition, the author has revised and updated all the chapters and added a new chapter addressing climate change, one of the most important ethical challenges of our generation. Some of the questions discussed in this book concern our daily lives. Is it ethical to buy luxuries when others do not have enough to eat? Should we buy meat from intensively reared animals? Am I doing something wrong if my carbon footprint is above the global average? Other questions confront us as concerned citizens: equality and discrimination on the grounds of race or sex; abortion, the use of embryos for research and euthanasia; political violence and terrorism; and the preservation of our planet's environment. This book's lucid style and provocative arguments make it an ideal text for university courses and for anyone willing to think about how she or he ought to live.",B004YPJ8SM,B004YPJ8SM,Kindle Edition,,353 pages,"

He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called ""the Hard Four."" On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right--with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself.As he works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines, tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraordinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child--who may be Victor's salvation.Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost.Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe.",0316261246,9780316261241),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Londres, año 2002.Julia, una escritora londinense de éxito y posición acomodada, está pasando por un momento crucial en su vida. Sus intereses se han desvanecido y su existencia le parece monótona y vacía. Pero todo está a punto de cambiar. La madrugada del 8 de noviembre del 2002 recibe una llamada de teléfono. Et in Arcadia ego, son las palabras que escucha al otro lado. Sin saber por qué, Julia presiente que existe una relación entre esas palabras y la muerte de Gloria, una niña asesinada por su madre hace dos años.Al día siguiente comienza a investigar el asesinato y lo que descubre la lleva hasta Daniel, hermano de Gloria, un joven de dieciséis años por el que, a pesar de la diferencia de edad, se siente atraída desde el primer momento. Daniel, actor de teatro y una incipiente estrella de rock, posee además una belleza salvaje y un atractivo sexual imposible de ignorar. Julia se da cuenta de que el deseo de abandonar su mediocre existencia ha sido escuchado. Pero salir de ese estado no será fácil. Arcadia no es un lugar, sino una forma de mirar y estar en el mundo. Daniel y su visión pagana, vital y peligrosa de la vida, pondrá a prueba los valores y la racionalidad de Julia.La imposible conexión que Daniel mantiene con el dios griego Dioniso, dios del éxtasis, la música, la locura y la muerte le convierte en un ser fronterizo. Para Daniel todo está lleno de dioses. Su vida es un teatro real donde el poder de los oráculos y la fuerza indiscutible de lo trágico están siempre presentes. Su lema es arriesgado y heroico: Sólo aquellos que están dispuestos a librarse de los límites y traspasar con los dioses el territorio de lo prohibido son capaces de vencer a la muerte.“Cuando un dios irrumpe en nuestras vidas y nos inunda con el deseo de penetrar y ser penetrados por lo inefable, vivir se convierte en una aventura. Ante la conquista ineludible de la muerte, los dioses nos ofrecen un pacto de mutua fascinación. Sólo los héroes sienten sobre sí el poder de su lúcida mirada.”",Spanish,Spanish,Hardcover,,411 pages,"

"," In the summer of 1946, while secluded in August Strindberg’s small cabin in the Stockholm archipelago, Stig Dagerman wrote Island of the Doomed. This novel was unlike any other yet seen in Sweden and would establish him as the country’s brightest literary star. To this day it is a singular work of fiction—a haunting tale that oscillates around seven castaways as they await their inevitable death on a desert island populated by blind gulls and hordes of iguanas. At the center of the island is a poisonous lagoon, where a strange fish swims in circles and devours anything in its path. As we are taken into the lives of each castaway, it becomes clear that Dagerman’s true subject is the nature of horror itself.Island of the Doomed is a chilling profile of terror and guilt and a stunning exploration—written under the shadow of the Nuremberg Trials—of the anxieties of a generation in the postwar nuclear age.

But that’s really not a problem for sixth form student Rylie Harcourt. Instead, what might prove somewhat difficult to overcome is the school’s strict policy concerning on-campus relationships.All sexual contact is expressly forbidden. Carnal pursuits are a distraction from learning, so says the Headmistress, and virtue is to be as highly regarded as education—if not higher. This harsh ban on expressions of love becomes especially problematic when Rylie meets her new French Housemistress, Vivienne Carriveau, and attraction sparks.In a sexless environment, thirty-one-year-old Mademoiselle Carriveau is a magnet for the affections of her hormonal, adolescent students. Competition for her attention is fierce, and when it starts to become clear that Rylie’s burgeoning interest in her is reciprocated in equal measure, tension among the student body rises to a deadly level.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,213 pages,"

","When a mysterious figure appears in Three Pines one cold November day, Armand Gamache and the rest of the villagers are at first curious. Then wary. Through rain and sleet, the figure stands unmoving, staring ahead.From the moment its shadow falls over the village, Gamache, now Chief Superintendent of the Surete du Quebec, suspects the creature has deep roots and a dark purpose. Yet he does nothing. What can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his mounting fears are not realized.But when the figure vanishes overnight and a body is discovered, it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or levied.Months later, on a steamy July day as the trial for the accused begins in Montreal, Chief Superintendent Gamache continues to struggle with actions he set in motion that bitter November, from which there is no going back. More than the accused is on trial. Gamache's own conscience is standing in judgment.In Glass Houses, her latest utterly gripping book, number-one New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny shatters the conventions of the crime novel to explore what Gandhi called the court of conscience.

","alternate cover for ISBN 0571084834Since it was first published in 1954, William Golding's classic debut novel has remained a stark allegory of civilization, survival, and human nature. As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and Battle Royale surge in popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world, raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned.When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality — and brutal savagery — of their situation sets in.A teacher himself, Golding clearly understood how to interest children with a gripping story and strong, sympathetic characters. The novel serves as a catalyst for thought-provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues, not only concerning the capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition, but beyond.The boys' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Symbolism is strong throughout, revealing both the boys' capacity for empathy and hope, as well as illuminating the darkest corners of the human spirit. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be.Often compared to Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost.Front cover illustration by Cathie Felstead",English,English,Paperback,,223 pages,"

","Claire Morgan, una autora desconocida y que eligió permanecer en el más absoluto anonimato, publicó en 1952 una novela, El precio de la sal, notablemente audaz para la época. Los críticos trataron el libro con una mezcla de desconcierto y respeto, pero el éxito de público fue inmediato, y se vendieron más de un millón de ejemplares de la edición de bolsillo. La novela no volvió a editarse, y ahora reaparece con el título Carol, que originalmente le había dado su autora, y firmada por ésta con su verdadero nombre.Carol es una novela de amor entre mujeres –de ahí la decisión de Patricia Highsmith de publicarla bajo un seudónimo, para no ser clasificada como una «escritora lesbiana»–, que se lee con la misma fascinada atención que despiertan las novelas «policíacas» de su autora. Highsmith concibió Carol en 1948, cuando tenía veintisiete años y había terminado su primera novela, Extraños en un tren. Se encontraba sin dinero, y se empleó durante una temporada en la sección de juguetes de unos grandes almacenes. Un día, una elegante mujer rubia envuelta en visones entró a comprar una muñeca, dio un nombre y una dirección para que se la enviaran y se marchó. Patricia Highsmith se fue a casa y escribió de un tirón un primer borrador de Carol, que comienza precisamente con el encuentro entre Therese, una joven escenógrafa que trabaja accidentalmente como dependienta, y Carol, la elegante y sofisticada mujer, recientemente divorciada, que entra a comprar una muñeca para su hija y cambia para siempre el curso de la vida de la joven vendedora.",8433911465,9788433911469),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Un autre monde vous attend, là, de l'autre côté du mur... Kell est le dernier des magiciens de sang, des sorciers capables de voyager d'un monde à l'autre. Des mondes, il y en a quatre, dont Londres est, à chaque fois, le cœur et l'âme. Le nôtre est gris, sans magie d'aucune sorte. Celui de Kell, rouge – on y respire le merveilleux à chaque bouffée d'air. Le troisième est blanc : là, les sortilèges se font si rares qu'on s'y tranche la gorge pour une simple incantation. Le dernier est noir, noir comme la mort qui l'a envahi quand la magie a dévoré tout ce qui s'y trouvait, obligeant les trois autres à couper tout lien avec lui. Depuis cette contagion, il est interdit de transporter le moindre objet entre les univers. C'est malgré tout ce que Kell va prendre le risque de faire, histoire de défier la famille royale qui l'a pourtant adopté comme son fils, à commencer par le prince Rhy, son frère, pour qui il donnerait par ailleurs sa vie sans hésiter. Mais, à force de jouer avec le feu, il finit par commettre l'irréparable : il emporte jusque dans le Londres gris une pierre noire comme la nuit, qu'une jeune fille du nom de Lila décide, sur un coup de tête, de lui subtiliser. Pour elle comme pour lui – pour leurs deux mondes, à vrai dire – le compte à rebours est lancé. Un autre monde vous attend, là, de l'autre côté du mur...

","What would you risk to be free?It’s 1776 and Isabel, Curzon, and Ruth have only ever known life as slaves. But now the young country of America is in turmoil—there are whisperings, then cries, of freedom from England spreading like fire, and with it is a whole new type of danger. For freedom being fought for one isn’t necessarily freedom being fought for all…especially if you are a slave. But if an entire nation can seek its freedom, why can’t they? As war breaks out, sides must be chosen, death is at every turn, and one question forever rings in their ears: Would you risk everything to be free? As battles rage up and down the Eastern seaboard, Isabel, Curzon, and Ruth flee, separate, fight, face unparalleled heartbreak and, just like war, they must depend on their allies—and each other—if they are to survive. Which leads to a second, harrowing question: Amidst so much pain and destruction, can they even recognize who their allies are?",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,928 pages,"

Now, with enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra are forced to fight their way onto one of the evacuating craft, with an enemy warship in hot pursuit.  But the warship could be the least of their problems. A deadly plague has broken out and is mutating, with terrifying results; the fleet's AI, which should be protecting them, may actually be their biggest threat; and nobody in charge will say what's really going on. As Kady plunges into a web of data hacking to get to the truth, it's clear only one person can help her bring it all to light: Ezra.  Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents--including emails, schematics, military files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more--Illuminae is the first book in a heart-stopping, high-octane trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.",0553499149,9780553499148),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","It is 1948 in an England still shaken by war. At 21 Nevern Street, London, Queenie Bligh takes into her house lodgers who have recently arrived from Jamaica. What else could she do when her husband, Bernard, never returned from his RAF wartime posting to India? Among her tenants are Gilbert and his new wife Hortense. Gilbert Joseph was one of the several thousand Jamaican men who joined the RAF to fight against Hitler. Returning to England after the war he finds himself treated very differently now that he is no longer in a blue uniform. Desperation makes him remember a wartime friendship with Queenie and knock at her door. Hortense shared Gilbert's dream of leaving Jamaica and coming to England to start a better life. But when she at last joins her husband, she is shocked by London's shabbiness and horrified at the way the English live. Even Gilbert is not the man she thought he was. Queenie's neighbours do not approve of her choice of tenants, and neither would her husband, were he there. Through the stories of these people, SMALL ISLAND explores a point in England's past when the country began to change.","London,",1948,Paperback,,448 pages,"

","Written in Greek, without any intention of publication, by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180) offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Ranging from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the nature of moral virtue, human rationality, divine providence, and Marcus' own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation and encouragement, in developing his beliefs Marcus Aurelius also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a timeless collection of extended meditations and short aphorisms that has been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and readers through the centuries.",English,English,Hardcover,,145 pages,"

","Shinjo Ito (1906-1989), founder of the Shinnyo-en stream of Buddhism, was one of Japan's most versatile Buddhist sculptors and an accomplished artist in fields as diverse as calligraphy and photography. Throughout his life he created countless artworks as a way of giving form to his deeply held faith - in 1957 producing probably his greatest milestone, the Great Parinirvana Image; a 16-foot (480 cm) long statue of Buddha Shakyamuni about to enter his final nirvana. The book is an inspirational testament to one of Japan's most significant modern religious artists. For the first time, this book fully reveals Shinjo's unique capacity to meld spirituality and artistry, as well as realism and interpretation. The work of Shinjo Ito can be admired for the artist's skill and the beauty of their execution. But Shinjo also created them to inspire and inform meditation and contemplation.",8863020027,9788863020021),Hardcover,,184 pages,"

","The Imperial Survey Service has four levels of classification for the detection of non-human intelligence. Level one is the most common, possible evidence. Level two, clear evidence of non-human intelligence. Level three is verified signs of non-human intelligence. Level three has a very high burden of proof, requiring verified artifacts. It is the last step before level four. Contact.Centuries ago, Humanity reached for the stars. But the galaxy has turned out to be a lonely place. The Imperial Survey Service explores systems and identifies planets for colonization beyond the edge of explored space, beyond the rim worlds. They also search for signs of an alien civilization. It is a part of their mission they take very seriously.A routine planetary survey mission to system X5682 believes they have found clear evidence of intelligent activity. The usual reports are made. Protocol demands that any reports of potential intelligent activity be investigated. A small fleet task force is dispatched. Their job is to secure the system. Task force Marines secure the site until Imperial Survey can verify the find. The routine has been played out many times, and always ends the same way. No scientific findings, an explainable phenomenon, no confirmation.Until now.The survey team leader is elated by his potential discovery. It is an elation the fleet task force commander does not share. His captains are also ambivalent, save one who is out to prove himself.Unfortunately, the fleet task force has to be to be cobbled together from people unfortunate enough to delay too long before proceeding on shore leave. The Marines are not exactly welcome in the midst of a group of scientists who are used to being immersed in their research on a new planet.The Imperial Fleet mostly keeps the peace and war is a faded memory. That means resources are tight and ships stay in service a long time. The task force that arrives is not exactly in perfect condition. Even the Marines have to be pulled from different ships and base assignments. Everyone expects a short mission once they reach the planet. All they have to do is wait for the specialist team from the Imperial Survey Service to show up and declare another potential find to be nothing after all.Unexpectedly, without warning, humanity makes first contact. Elation turns to desperation and a fight for survival. The Globur are coming.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,,"

","""Not since Albert Camus has there been such an eloquent spokesman for man."" --The New York Times Book ReviewThe publication of Day restores Elie Wiesel's original title to the novel initially published in English as The Accident and clearly establishes it as the powerful conclusion to the author's classic trilogy of Holocaust literature, which includes his memoir Night and novel Dawn. ""In Night it is the ‘I' who speaks,"" writes Wiesel. ""In the other two, it is the ‘I' who listens and questions.""In its opening paragraphs, a successful journalist and Holocaust survivor steps off a New York City curb and into the path of an oncoming taxi. Consequently, most of Wiesel's masterful portrayal of one man's exploration of the historical tragedy that befell him, his family, and his people transpires in the thoughts, daydreams, and memories of the novel's narrator. Torn between choosing life or death, Day again and again returns to the guiding questions that inform Wiesel's trilogy: the meaning and worth of surviving the annihilation of a race, the effects of the Holocaust upon the modern character of the Jewish people, and the loss of one's religious faith in the face of mass murder and human extermination.",0809023091,9780809023097),Paperback,,109 pages,"

","“This is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.” In a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nation’s history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?  Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward.",0147520509,9780147520500),Audiobook,eAudiobook,4 pages,"

","THE TRIAL is a novel written by Franz Kafka from 1914 to 1915 and published in 1925. One of his best-known works, it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Heavily influenced by Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative. Like Kafka's other novels, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end.After Kafka's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede. The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany. The first English language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937. In 1999, the book was listed in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century and as No. 2 of the Best German Novels of the Twentieth Century.

","No final de uma vida, entrando no seu epílogo, um homem já sem destino para cumprir medita sobre o seu passado e o seu futuro, no regresso a uma casa vazia onde passou parte da sua infância, povoada de fantasmas que evocam os momentos chave da sua existência. Recheado de flash-backs para o passado e para o futuro (!), a antevisão, real e com todos os detalhes, da degradação da sua velhice e do seu funeral urge em Paulo a derradeira tentativa de procura da explicação de um sentido para a vida, alimentada por muitos sonhos e esperanças no tempo em que tal era devido, cheia de frustrações e desilusões posteriores frutos de um destino azarado e de uma fatalidade previsível, condições propícias para um redescobrir da vida nos elementos mais simples que anteriormente passavam despercebidos na azáfama do cumprimento do quotidiano e de toda uma vida alicerçada nos seus valores supostamente mais altos.Nesta narrativa de evocações aleatórias, centrada no romance de Paulo com Sandra, mulher difícil e de poucos sentimentalismos, a redução de uma vida ao seu cumprimento basilar pelo amor, último alicerce num mundo de ilusões, revelando-se semítico na sua realização, e defraudado ainda por uma filha que o confronta com a esterilidade da sua actividade e do seu pensamento, mumificando-o no seu tempo presente, tempo esse prometedor de progressos civilizacionais que os próprios contemporâneos se encarregam de deitar a perder, ébrios de uma liberdade utópica que nada concilia face à disparidade de vertentes, facções e pontos de vista que num ruído ensurdecedor emudece e paralisa a humanidade no êxtase do extremo da civilização actual.Vítima do seu próprio pensamento perscrutador, questionando a sua condição humana e a dos outros, comparando-a até ao fim dos tempos, um lamento arrastado mas pontuado por algumas fagulhas de lucidez e outras de felicidade passada e presente, num acomodar inconsciente contrastante de uma luta ávida pela vida onde persistem ainda mais perguntas que respostas apesar de toda a sofreguidão de viver tal como evidenciado pelo relato de vida do narrador. A paz nunca chega, para sempre continua a percepção do abismo entre aquilo que se é e aquilo que se sente.Paulo Neves da Silva,Oeiras, Portugal",Portuguese,Portuguese,Paperback,,306 pages,"

Believing confession erases the sin of murder, her morbid desires are in unity with faith, though she could never justify her skill to the magistrate she loves.At the start of the 16th century in Tudor England, Lavinia’s marks grow from tavern drunks to nobility, but rising prestige brings increased risk. When the magistrate suspects her ruse, he pressures the priest into breaking her confessional seal, pitting Lavinia’s instincts as an assassin against the tenets of love and faith. She balances revenge with her struggle to develop a tasteless poison and avoid the wrath of her ruthless patron.With her ideals in conflict, Lavinia must decide which will satisfy her heart: love, faith, or murder—but the betrayals are just beginning.* Contains a book club reading guide in the back.* Available on Google Play""One should never condone murder, but, strangely, I rooted for Lavinia. Pohlkamp made her easily understandable, despite her odd sense of morality. She had to survive in a time period dominated by men...Her dark obsession with poison, her love for the magistrate, Haylan Moryet, and her belief in God turn the narrative into something fascinating and substantial that powers the heart of the story.""- 5 Star Review From Readers' Favorite",1946802026,9781946802026),Paperback,First,369 pages,"

Novelist Vince Scarsella draws on his real life experiences of over 18 years as head of the Eighth Judicial District Grievance Committee in Buffalo, New York to craft a gripping, suspenseful novel about lawyers gone bad.

","From the award-winning, New York Times bestselling author of NOS4A2 and Heart-Shaped Box comes a chilling novel about a worldwide pandemic of spontaneous combustion that threatens to reduce civilization to ashes and a band of improbable heroes who battle to save it, led by one powerful and enigmatic man known as the Fireman.The fireman is coming. Stay cool.No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe.Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child.Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged.In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.",0062200631,9780062200631),Hardcover,First Edition,752 pages,"

","Cuando se publicó El Retrato de Dorian Gray, la crítica moralizante no dejó de acusar a su protagonista de ser una figura satánica, corrompida y corruptora, sin comprender que era el héroe de una novela que reflejaba la fatalidad de los románticos. Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) había querido hacer de la belleza un refinamiento de la inteligencia, y para ello sumió a su protagonista, Dorian Gray, en una atmósfera de perversión dominada por el arte y los poderes de un misterio que está más allá de la realidad: gracias a los dioses, el culto a la belleza puede trasladar las huellas del paso del tiempo a un cuadro, mientras el rostro de Dorian Gray permanece inalterado e inalterable.Cuento fantástico y parábola, El Retrato de Dorian Gray sigue siendo una piedra angular entre la ética y la estética, en las relaciones que mantienen el bien y el mal, el alma y el cuerpo, el arte y la vida. Dominado por la ley de la fatalidad, Dorian Gray, que también encarna el mal y su castigo, no deja de alcanzar el objetivo que el propio Wilde quería para su libro: ""Venenoso si ustedes quieren, pero no podrán negar que también es perfecto, y la perfección es la meta a la que apuntamos nosotros los artistas"".",8467032537,9788467032536),Hardcover,Edición especial,281 pages,"

A drastic change of heart. 

A determined choice to commit. 

An unexpected betrayal at a critical moment. 


There is nothing like a birthday to give Hamilton Dinger something to look forward to in his busy life. With his new job as a part-time intern at the Mayor’s office, being a full-time high school student and starlight warrior has its challenges. And although he has the full support of his girlfriend, Gwen, and his best friend, Mikey, and even a tentative partnership with Starry Knight, his ally against the Seven Deadly Sinisters, Hamilton has definite cause for concern.The arrival of SWORD, the growing demonic activity in Apollo City, and the increasingly negative media attention has sparked ongoing unrest among the city and its inhabitants. To gain more power, Elysian and Hamilton set off for the Celestial Kingdom to deepen his commitment through learning, new landscapes, and cosmic surfing, evil forces continue in their quest for power and control. But when Hamilton finds uncertainty and distrust between his two worlds, will he be able to find the answers to his questions? Will he find the strength he needs to carry on? Will he realize the importance of his choices, and more importantly–make the right ones?

FROM THE BOOK: 

There had been a feeling hanging over me in the past few weeks, a feeling that change was coming. It didn't click until that moment that change had already arrived. I was changing, things were changing, and I was finally okay - in fact, more than okay - with that. It was flooring, the idea I was looking forward to something more in life than Tetris and being cheered on by my friends. Those things still mattered, of course, but there was more, and I was enthralled there was more. 





FROM THE AUTHOR: 

Cross through the River Veil and into the world beyond the Star of Time in the Starlight Chronicles, a young adult epic fantasy series from C. S. Johnson. Be on the lookout for Book 4, Remembering, as Hamilton and his fellow superheroes continue to fight evil and get their schoolwork finished!Perfect for young teenagers or disaffected college students, or adults who enjoy some satire mixed in with some star-crossed lovers and high school drama! 


WHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING: 
Once again, this book features a less than likeable main character, but we are seeing his grow and change and mature (just a bit) since the first book. This book has the benefit of being right in the middle of the story right away.  ~ Stephanie, Audiobook Enthusiast and Goodreads ReviewerThis series just keeps getting better and better, with new characters and a deeper story unfolding. ~ Terri, Emerging Author and Goodreads Reviewer",English,English,Kindle Edition,,328 pages,"

","'Just because you can't explain it, doesn't mean it's a miracle.'In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was: 'Hey, you!' This is the Discworld, after all, and religion is a controversial business. Everyone has their own opinion, and indeed their own gods, of every shape and size, and all elbowing for space at the top. In such a competitive environment, shape and size can be pretty crucial to make one's presence felt. So it's certainly not helpful to be reduced to appearing in the form of a tortoise, a manifestation far below god-like status in anyone's book.In such instances, you need an acolyte, and fast: for the Great God Om, Brutha the novice is the Chosen One – or at least the only One available.

","Uma história de amor pode tomar muitas formas. Em Retalhos, premiada graphic novel que colocou Craig Thompson entre os grandes nomes do quadrinho mundial, foi a história de um jovem que se viu preso entre valores religiosos e a força da primeira paixão. Em Habibi, é a saga de dois escravos fugitivos, unidos e separados pelo destino, vivendo no limite que separa a tradição da descoberta.Dodola, uma garota perspicaz e independente, foge de seus captores levando consigo um bebê. Eles crescem juntos no deserto, sozinhos em um navio naufragado na areia. Em meio a sentimentos cada vez mais conflitantes, os dois passam o tempo contando histórias. Assim, somos apresentados também à origem do islamismo e de suas tradições, conforme as narrativas se combinam numa trama de aventura, romance, filosofia e tragédia.Para contar a saga de Dodola e Zam, Craig Thompson recorreu ao Corão e às Mil e uma noites. Do primeiro, colheu o próprio estilo do livro, inspirado na caligrafia árabe, e também as narrativas do texto sagrado dos muçulmanos, recriadas com maestria pela pena do autor. Do segundo, tirou um cenário fantasioso, repleto de lendas e histórias, uma versão quase mitológica da nossa ideia de Oriente. Ambientado nos dias de hoje, Habibi não se passa em nenhum país conhecido. É uma terra igualmente fantástica e concreta, onde questões presentes se misturam a indagações ancestrais. Crítica social, questionamentos ecológicos, paralelos entre religião e amor: tudo encontra seu lugar nesta narrativa tão épica quanto particular. Fruto de sete anos de pesquisas e trabalho, Habibi é um monumento do quadrinho moderno e uma resposta atual a questões que nos perseguem desde sempre.",8535921311,9788535921311),Paperback,,680 pages,"

","Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere: An Illustrated Introduction provides a complete foundation in the practice of one of the most distinctive and useful Japanese martial arts.Aikido was created in Japan in the 1920's by Morihei Ueshiba, also known as Osensei. To possess the skills, techniques and attitude of the faithful practitioner of aikido, one must achieve a very high level of integration of the powers of mind and body, the harmonious combination of physical means and ethical motives. By controlling body position and learning how to harmonize important physical and mental abilities, anyone (regardless of size, strength or weight) can fend off attacks using this sophisticated martial art.Written and illustrated by husband/wife team, Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere, with over 1,200 illustrations, includes many Aikido techniques in chapters such as:What is Aikido?The Foundations of AikidoThe Practice of AikidoThe Basic Techniques of NeutralizationAdvanced PracticeAnd more!",0804832846,9780804832847),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","There will be plenty of time for me to beat him soundly once I’ve gotten what I came for.Sent on a mission to retrieve an ancient hidden map—the key to a legendary treasure trove—seventeen-year-old pirate captain Alosa deliberately allows herself to be captured by her enemies, giving her the perfect opportunity to search their ship.More than a match for the ruthless pirate crew, Alosa has only one thing standing between her and the map: her captor, the unexpectedly clever and unfairly attractive first mate, Riden. But not to worry, for Alosa has a few tricks up her sleeve, and no lone pirate can stop the Daughter of the Pirate King.",1250095964,9781250095961),Hardcover,,311 pages,"

It's not the sins her eyes have seen, but the sins her body has felt.
 Mikayla Anderson is a survivor... barely. A less than normal upbringing has left her ripped apart by someone she was supposed to trust. To escape the dangers in her home life, she buys a one-way ticket as far away as her meager savings will take her--Nashville. Working in a dingy diner, Mikayla tries to get her life in order, but the past won't let her go. She turns to self-harm as a way to cope, until one day she takes it too far. Tyler Hunt might be country rock's biggest star, but fame doesn't erase the memories of the past, neither does his vice. When drinking lands Tyler in Chasing Freedom Recovery Center again, he's angry and in denial. When he sees Mikayla, he immediately marks her certifiably crazy, until he looks into her eyes, and sees a depth of pain that he's all too familiar with. An unlikely relationship simmers, offering each other the light and warmth that's been missing. When the past catches up and threatens Mikayla, Tyler will do anything to protect her.Author's Note: While it is not necessary to read Red Lights, Black Hearts before Twisted in You, this novel contains some minor spoilers.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,,,,,"['Romance', 'Adult']"

","What happens to the girls nobody sees—the ones who are ignored, mistreated, hidden away? The girls nobody hears when they cry for help?Fourteen-year-old Luce is one of those lost girls. After her father vanishes in a storm at sea, she is stuck in a grim, gray Alaskan fishing village with her alcoholic uncle. When her uncle crosses an unspeakable line, Luce reaches the depths of despair. Abandoned on the cliffs near her home, she expects to die when she tumbles to the icy, churning waves below. Instead, she undergoes an astonishing transformation and becomes a mermaid. A tribe of mermaids finds Luce and welcomes her in—all of them, like her, lost girls who surrendered their humanity in the darkest moments of their lives. The mermaids are beautiful, free, and ageless, and Luce is thrilled with her new life until she discovers the catch: they feel an uncontrollable desire to drown seafarers, using their enchanted voices to lure ships into the rocks.Luce’s own talent at singing captures the attention of the tribe’s queen, the fierce and elegant Catarina, and Luce soon finds herself pressured to join in committing mass murder. Luce’s struggle to retain her inner humanity puts her at odds with her friends; even worse, Catarina seems to regard Luce as a potential rival. But the appearance of a devious new mermaid brings a real threat to Catarina’s leadership and endangers the very existence of the tribe. Can Luce find the courage to challenge the newcomer, even at the risk of becoming rejected and alone once again?Lost Voices is a captivating and wildly original tale about finding a voice, the healing power of friendship, and the strength it takes to forgive.",0547482507,9780547482507),Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","When Kira Sullivan's best friend convinces her to interview at a new nightclub on the St. Louis Riverfront, she has no idea it is run by the Coronado Mob family; nor that there are ties to her husband's law firm, Parker, Sullivan & Bates. By the time she connects the dots, it's too late... she's trapped in a web of lies, her family jeopardized and her best friend has disappeared. Hot on the trail of a serial killer, Detective Rocco Sterling, finds himself distracted by a woman who shares an uncanny resemblance to a lost love, not realizing their meeting is more than just coincidence until he finds her body in a dumpster across town. The deeper Kira digs the quicker her life unravels, leaving her fate resting insecurely in the hands of a stranger. Paths collide in a search for truth that grows deadlier at every turn, as the lines between right and wrong blur into an immoral mess of desire, betrayal and revenge. Caught between an ugly truth she doesn't want to face and a haunting reality to which she feels drawn, Kira must learn to trust her instincts and take life at The Candy Shop one bite size piece at a time.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,312 pages,"

","Le Zarathoustra de Nietzsche continue de fasciner, plus que 100 ans après sa première publication. Par son écriture, d'abord, qui rappelle, à bien des égards, la Bible et sa dimension allégorique mais aussi la poésie sombre sombre d'Hölderlin. Par la présence du personnage de Zarathoustra ensuite, qui tient autant du Christ, par son côté prophétique, que du révolutionnaire, qui annonce le «surhomme», c'est à dire celui qui veut aller au-delà des valeurs reconnues et des vérités admises, sans volonté de domination. Magnifique et déroutant poème, ce texte est à l'image de cette formule du Prologue: «Il faut porter encore en soi un chaos, pour pouvoir mettre au monde une étoile dansante.»",2253006750,9782253006756),Paperback,Le Livre de Poche - Classique,410 pages,"

","À travers l’histoire d’un jeune photographe de presse s’interrogeant sur ce qu’il doit faire de sa vie, Larcenet brosse une comédie parfois drôle, parfois triste sur le passage à l’âge adulte, sur l’amour et les choix qu’il implique, sur notre comportement vis à vis des autres et du passé.Une grosse claque par un auteur en état de grâce. Mine de rien, on a beaucoup de chance ! ! ! Larcenet est venu chez Dargaud avec Lazarr et les Cosmonautes. C’était déjà vraiment bien. Puis coup sur coup, on a vu et lu son évolution et l’on assiste, en direct, à l’avènement d’un auteur hors du commun, sans doute le meilleur de sa génération.Le Retour à la Terre, sommet d’humour était la première étape : prouver que Larcenet peut faire rire tout le monde, des lecteurs de “La Vie” au bédéphile le plus pointu ; le Combat Ordinaire enfonce magistralement le clou dans une veine plus réaliste, tendre et violente.Tout ce que bien des cinéastes ou des romanciers ont voulu capter sur le passage à l’âge adulte, sur l’amour et les choix qu’il implique, sur notre comportement vis à vis des autres et de l’Histoire, le Combat Ordinaire parvient miraculeusement à le retranscrire, nous le faire partager. Tous les débats stériles sur la guerre d’Algérie, puisqu’il s’agit aussi de ça, prennent une grande baffe dans la gueule. Le Combat est l’oeuvre d’un auteur en état de grâce qui parvient dans une chronique douce amère, jamais intello et toujours légère à parler de façon simple de choses très compliquées.",2205054252,9782205054255),Hardcover,,54 pages,"

At least he won't be alone; joining him are three other masters of the macabre, writers who have helped shape modern horror.

I met him at fifteen at summer camp, and for three perfect summers, he was mine. Until the blazing heat of the summer sun faded and reality crashed in. Carver went off to college, leaving me trapped in my small farming town, with no way of reaching him and a problem I needed solving. Carver As the senior captain of my college basketball team, all I've been focused on the past four years has been playing, school, getting drafted in the NBA, and steering clear of relationships. I didn't want them. I had nothing to give another girl. I'd given it already. So, I built my rep as a player, and honed my natural ability to charm the pants off girls. It's what I did. Who I was. Who I am. Until March, when a lay-up during a tournament landed me in an emergency room, under the care of Logan Shaw - my first love. Of all the people I could run into, why did it have to be her? Not only did my face get split wide open, but so did the locks that held the pain I'd attempted to bury for so many years. Now that she's back in my life, we must face the truth and the consequences of our actions - even if it could destroy us. We must uncover the truths that have kept us shackled from moving forward.

She carries a letter from a man who mysteriously signs himself as “the Old Musician” and claims to have known her father in the Khmer Rouge prison where he disappeared twenty-five years ago.In Phnom Penh, Teera finds a society still in turmoil, where perpetrators and survivors of unfathomable violence live side by side, striving to mend their still beloved country. She meets a young doctor who begins to open her heart, confronts her long-buried memories, and prepares to learn her father’s fate.Meanwhile, the Old Musician, who earns his modest keep playing ceremonial music at a temple, awaits Teera’s visit. He will have to confess the bonds he shared with her parents, the passion with which they all embraced the Khmer Rouge’s illusory promise of a democratic society, and the truth about her father’s end.A love story for things lost and restored, a lyrical hymn to the power of forgiveness, Music of the Ghosts is a “sensitive portrait of the inheritance of survival” (USA TODAY) and a journey through the embattled geography of the heart where love can be reborn.",1508228175,9781508228172),Audiobook,eAudiobook,,"

Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).

","In the wake of crash-landing on a deserted tropical island, a group of private-school teens must rely on their wits and one another to survive. Having just survived a plane crash, Samantha Mishra finds herself isolated and injured in the thick of the jungle. She has no idea where she is or where anybody else is -- she doesn't even know if anybody else is alive. Once Sam connects with her best friend, Mel, and they locate the others, they set up camp and hope for rescue. But as the days pass, the survivors, all teammates on the Drake Rosemont fencing team, realize that they're on their own -- with the exception of a mysterious presence who taunts and threatens them. When their initial attempts to escape the island fail, the teens find they need to survive more than the jungle . . . they need to survive each other.This taut novel, with a setting evocative of Lord of the Flies, is by turns cinematic and intimate, and always thought-provoking.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","Прочутия роман на Достоевски - ""Бесове"" е една жестока метафора на паденията и възземанията на човешкия дух.Евангелският разказ за бесовете Достоевски поставя като мото на своя роман, после той се разиграва в целия му текст, за да обясни поведението, движението и действията на неговите герои, целия сюжет и комплекта от идеи на гениалната му книга.Ето и самото събитие така, както то е разказано от евангелиста Лука (8, 32-36): ""А там по рътлината пасеше голямо стадо свини; бесовете Го молеха, да им позволи да влязат в тях. И им позволи. Като излязоха бесовете от човека, влязоха в свините; и сурна се стадото низ стръмнината в езерото и се издави. Свинарите, като видяха станалото, избягаха, та разказаха в града и околността. И излязоха да видят станалото; и като дойдоха при Иисуса, намериха човека, от когото бяха излезли бесовете, седнал при нозете Иисусови, облечен и със здрав ум; и се изплашиха. А ония, които бяха видели, разказаха им как се спаси бесният.""Ако не се търси пълно съвпадение, буквален аналог, а само много повече говореща символика, според Бердяев революцията (голямата) в Русия досущ напомня за историята с бесовете, излезли от един и вселили се в други - така Достоевски е предусетил и предвидял онова, което ще стане десетилетия след него. Тежко на обзетите от бесовете и блазе на онези, които са се освободили от тях.",9549559041,9789549559040),Hardcover,,693 pages,"

","The streets of Parole are dangerous - and fragile. They can crumble underfoot and vanish at any moment. And with a permanent fire below, even walking can be perilous. Sometimes, it's safer to run. When people with practical survival skills or fantastic abilities join forces to get jobs done without getting burned, they call it runtime.Even when stealth and reconnaissance expert Regan isn't actually invisible, nobody's better at hiding in plain sight. Or at slipping into places nobody else can reach, hearing things he shouldn't hear, learning things he shouldn't know. His reptilian reflexes and very specific skills make him invaluable to Parole's resistance, and very dangerous to the brutal Major Turret and his military and surveillance force called Eye in the Sky... and anything they want to keep a secret.Regan works best in the dark, and happily leaves the spotlight to his celebrated runtime partner: celebrated, infamous cyber-revolutionary CyborJ - that's 'Cybor-Jay,' who spends every night gleefully jabbing at Eye in the Sky with his keyboard of justice. His technical brilliance and flair for drama combine with Regan's stealth and secrecy to form Parole's most frighteningly effective runtime duo. Fortunately, they're the good guys.Tonight's run went off without a hitch. CyborJ just delivered the best cache of goodies yet to the people of quarantined Parole - but this time, that's just the beginning. Across the city, his silent partner Regan carries the real treasure in his pocket: a secret. A very sensitive, very dangerous secret about the world beyond the barrier.The hard part is over. All Regan has to do is get home alive - but this run is about to be intercepted. The grinning ghost Hans will make Regan an offer nobody in Parole could refuse: escape. Not just for Regan, but for all of them. All he has to do is betray everyone and everything he loves.Welcome to Parole, where the fire is always burning, and everyone is always running out of time.",B01LW0NEPG,B01LW0NEPG,ebook,,36 pages,"

","This volume puts together for the first time in one volume, the Four Arcanes, the amazing books written by William Walker Atkinson about the Wisdom of the Ages, or "" Arcane Teaching"" The volumes are: The Arcane Teaching, The Arcane Formulas, Vril (Vital Magnetism) & The Mystery of Sex. Says Atkinson that ""The Arcane Teaching has come down to the present age through the corridors of time, from the dim ages of past eras, races, and schools of thought. Even those highest in the councils of ""The Custodians of The Scroll,"" are unable to trace the Teaching, in an unbroken direct line, further back than the time of Pythagoras (about 500 b. c.), and a little later in Ancient Greece, although they find many references to, and extracts from, the teachings of ancient Egypt and Chaldea, which serve to show that the Pythagorean and Ancient Grecian Arcane Schools were founded on occult instruction still more remote, received in a direct line of succession of teachers and pupils extending over centuries. Investigators have found traces of the Arcane Teaching in the records of Persia and Medea, and it is believed that the inspiration for the original philosophical teaching (not the religion or the pessimism, however) of Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, was received from Arcane sources. Traces are also to be found in the Hebrew Esoteric Teachings of the ""Kabbalah"" and the ""Zohar.""The Grecian Arcane Teaching was undoubtedly obtained directly from Egyptian sources through Pythagoras, the relation between the early Grecian teaching and philosophies, and the older school of old Egypt, being very close and intimate. Pythagoras is known to have received instruction from Egyptian and Persian hierophants. Besides the traditions of the Arcanes, there is to be found the closest resemblance between the ancient Grecian teachings, and those of the Egyptian Esoteric Fraternities. Some of the Teachers, however, hold that the Grecian and Egyptian schools, respectively, were but two separate off shoots of an original and older Teaching which had its origin in the lost continent of Atlantis. There are many Arcane traditions connecting the Teaching with Atlantis, and it is possible that both Egypt and Greece received it from this common source, instead of Greece being indebted to Egypt for the line of transmission. But, be this as it may, it is a fact that all of the traces of teaching that the various occult schools gather from the traditions, scraps of doctrine, and legends regarding Atlantis can be reconciled with the Grecian Arcane Teaching.""",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,332 pages,"

Não sabia que teria de trocar a sua vida despreocupada na sociedade cosmopolita de Lisboa por uma missão tão patriótica quanto arriscada na distante ilha de S. Tomé. Não esperava que o cargo de governador e a defesa da dignidade dos trabalhadores das roças o lançassem numa rede de conflitos de interesses com a metrópole. E não contava que a descoberta do amor lhe viesse a mudar a vida. É com esta história admiravelmente bem escrita, comovente e perturbadora que Miguel Sousa Tavares inaugura a sua incursão na escrita literária. EQUADOR foi o fruto de uma longa maturação e investigação histórica que inspirou um romance fascinante vivido num período complexo da história portuguesa, no início do século XX e últimos anos da Monarquia.Miguel Sousa Tavares nasceu no Porto. Licenciado em Direito, abandonou a advocacia para se dedicar em exclusivo ao jornalismo. Ganhou os principais prémios de jornalismo em Portugal e, em 2003, publica o seu primeiro romance, que rapidamente se transforma num best-seller.",9895550138,9895550138,Paperback,,527 pages,"

","From the acclaimed author of Empires of Sand comes a mesmerizing new adventure that Jean Auel cites as “crowded with events that both forecast and mirror the conflicts of today.” Sweeping from the drawing rooms of Paris to the palace of Suleiman the Magnificent to the dark hold of a slave ship racing across the sea, here is a dazzling story of love and valor, innocence and identity, an epic novel of the clash of civilizations on a barren island where the future was forged.The Mediterranean, the sixteenth century: Lying squarely in the midst of the vital sea lanes between the Christian West and the Ottoman Empire in the East, and ruled by the ancient Order of the Knights of St. John, Malta will become the stage upon which the fate of the world turns. For one of its sons, the hand of violence strikes swiftly, when young Nicolo Borg is seized by Barbary slavers and launched on a remarkable journey to the court of the supreme ruler of the Muslim world. Renamed Asha, plotting his escape even as he swears allegiance to the god of his masters and is schooled in the arts of culture and war, the innocent boy will be transformed into one of the Sultan’s deadliest commanders. For Nico’s beloved sister, Maria, his loss fires her hatred for the knights who did nothing to save him and her dreams of escape from her stifling home. As the headstrong girl grows into a fierce beauty, she will capture the attention of one man in particular, Christien de Vries, a surgeon-knight torn between duty and desire, caught up in Malta’s frantic preparations against the coming Ottoman storm. Around Nico and Maria are men and women who will share their destinies: Dragut Raïs, a brilliant corsair, arch-rival of the knights…Giulio Salvago, a priest in full flight from his carnal nature…Alisa, a young beauty hidden away in a harem…Jean de La Valette, the master knight who is Malta’s only hope for survival.As the mighty Ottoman fleet bears down on the tiny island, as Nico Borg makes his way back to his homeland at the helm of a warship, Ironfire moves inexorably to a shattering climax where all will face ultimate justice in the murderous cauldron of siege warfare. Brilliantly capturing the crosscurrents of a storied age, Ironfire is historical fiction in the grand tradition, a stirring realization of a pivotal moment in time that irrevocably shaped the world we inhabit today.",0385336012,9780385336017),Hardcover,,688 pages,"

","Praca w służbach specjalnych niektórych może pociągać, innych odstraszać. Wiadomo — stres, narażanie życia i jeszcze obowiązek, który każe trzymać język za zębami. Nie jest łatwo. Ale dla niektórych to sposób na życie. Dzięki ciągłej dawce adrenaliny we krwi czują, że istnieją. Taką drogę wybrał również bohater książki Magdaleny Kozak. Służbie dla Ojczyzny gotowy był poświęcić wszystko. Dostał nowe życie, nową tożsamość, nową misję. Trafił do tajnej jednostki ABW, która pod przykrywką standardowych działań, zajmowała się walką z Renegatami — groźnym rodem wampirów. Stosując coraz nowsze i brutalniejsze metody Renegaci pozyskiwali świeży, życiodajny pokarm i niebezpiecznie szybko powiększali swoje szeregi. Vesper stanął przed wyborem: ile można poświęcić dla obrony innych, ofiarować własne życie? A co będzie, jeśli wówczas sam zostanie wampirem?Książka Magdaleny Kozak przedstawia intrygującą wizję polskiej rzeczywistości, w której rozgrywają się rzeczy, o jakich zwykłym obywatelom nawet się nie śniło. Nic w tej książce nie jest jednoznaczne, nawet dobro. Żaden bohater nie jest jednowymiarowy. Ta historia na pewno cię zaskoczy.Jeśli myślałeś, że wampiry nie istnieją, zobacz jak bardzo się myliłeś...",8389011832,9788389011831),Paperback,I,400 pages,"

","Set in the magical world of Renthia, The Queen of Blood is Sarah Beth Durst’s ambitious entry into adult epic fantasy. With the danger of Peter Brett’s The Warded Man, heart of Naomi Novik’s Uprooted, and lyricism of Patrick Rothfuss’ The Name of the Wind, this is the first chapter in a series destined to be a classic.Everything has a spirit: the willow tree with leaves that kiss the pond, the stream that feeds the river, the wind that exhales fresh snow . . .But the spirits that reside within this land want to rid it of all humans. One woman stands between these malevolent spirits and the end of humankind: the queen. She alone has the magical power to prevent the spirits from destroying every man, woman, and child. But queens are still just human, and no matter how strong or good, the threat of danger always looms.With the position so precarious, young women are chosen to train as heirs. Daleina, a seemingly quiet academy student, is under no illusions as to her claim to the throne, but simply wants to right the wrongs that have befallen the land. Ven, a disgraced champion, has spent his exile secretly fighting against the growing number of spirit attacks. Joining forces, these daring partners embark on a treacherous quest to find the source of the spirits’ restlessness—a journey that will test their courage and trust, and force them to stand against both enemies and friends to save their land . . .  before it’s bathed in blood.",006247409X,9780062474094),Mass Market Paperback,,388 pages,"

Ele só tinha sete anos. Um dos inquilinos foi o minerador de opala. O homem que certa noite roubou o carro da família e, ali dentro, parado num caminho deserto, cometeu suicídio. O homem cujo ato desesperado despertou forças que jamais deveriam ter sido perturbadas. Forças que não são deste mundo. Um horror primordial, sem controle, que foi libertado e passou a tomar os sonhos e a realidade das pessoas, inclusive os do menino. Ele sabia que os adultos não conseguiriam — e não deveriam — compreender os eventos que se desdobravam tão perto de casa. Sua família, ingenuamente envolvida e usada na batalha, estava em perigo, e somente o menino era capaz de perceber isso. A responsabilidade inescapável de defender seus entes queridos fez com que ele recorresse à única salvação possível: as três mulheres que moravam no fim do caminho. O lugar onde ele viu seu primeiro oceano.",8580573688,9788580573688),Paperback,,205 pages,"

","Throughout history and the present, inspiring and encouraging words from black people are like music to our souls when we become tired or distressed. The contribution and sacrifice of black people of the past and present are relevant, as we continue to fight inequality, racism and police brutality. Music or words in melodic form has always lifted black people when slave master's whip come out, or when white mobs slaughter and murder innocent black people without remorse. It is still a pleasure and honor to be a black person, for our legacy is comprised of extraordinary people who have done great things through their abilities to corroborate the struggle of their times. Therefore, African Americans should be proud despite the problems of today, for our rich ancestry is tied together, and together we are the recipients of a legacy they did not quit, tire or acquiesce when hate threaten their livelihood.",English,English,Paperback,,185 pages,"

If there's anything I've learned from him in the years since, it's that the dead hide truths as well as the living.When Tea accidentally resurrects her brother from the dead, she learns she is different from the other witches in her family. Her gift for necromancy means that she's a bone witch, a title that makes her feared and ostracized by her community.

","Hugely admired by Tolstoy, David Copperfield is the novel that draws most closely from Charles Dickens's own life. Its eponymous hero, orphaned as a boy, grows up to discover love and happiness, heartbreak and sorrow amid a cast of eccentrics, innocents, and villains. Praising Dickens's power of invention, Somerset Maugham wrote: ""There were never such people as the Micawbers, Peggotty and Barkis, Traddles, Betsey Trotwood and Mr. Dick, Uriah Heep and his mother. They are fantastic inventions of Dickens's exultant imagination...you can never quite forget them.""This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition includes a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize finalist David Gates, in addition to new explanatory notes.",0679783415,9780679783411),Paperback,,821 pages,"

","Ruth Jefferson is a labor and delivery nurse at a Connecticut hospital with more than twenty years' experience. During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she's been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy's counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family—especially her teenage son—as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other's trust, and come to see that what they've been taught their whole lives about others—and themselves—might be wrong. With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion—and doesn't offer easy answers. Small Great Things is a remarkable achievement from a writer at the top of her game.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,480 pages,"

","Micheline Helsing is a tetrachromat—a girl who sees the auras of the undead in a prismatic spectrum. As one of the last descendants of the Van Helsing lineage, she has trained since childhood to destroy monsters both corporeal and spiritual: the corporeal undead go down by the bullet, the spiritual undead by the lens. With an analog SLR camera as her best weapon, Micheline exorcises ghosts by capturing their spiritual energy on film. She's aided by her crew: Oliver, a techno-whiz and the boy who developed her camera's technology; Jude, who can predict death; and Ryder, the boy Micheline has known and loved forever.When a routine ghost hunt goes awry, Micheline and the boys are infected with a curse known as a soulchain.As the ghostly chains spread through their bodies, Micheline learns that if she doesn't exorcise her entity in seven days or less, she and her friends will die. Now pursued as a renegade agent by her monster-hunting father, Leonard Helsing, she must track and destroy an entity more powerful than anything she's faced before . . . or die trying.Lock, stock, and lens, she’s in for one hell of a week.　",1250044677,9781250044679),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","“Back to Planet Hoola”, written by Author Sudipta Das, is a Sci Fi (Science Fiction) book with philosophical and spiritual tinges, and the author’s wonderful realisations embedded in an alien plot of divine aspirations, evil desires, intrigue, wisdom and love. In this sequel to the Author’s internationally published and globally presented debut fiction, The Asylum Dweller’s Diary, there are imaginative, interesting and insightful stories within the storyline, serving you with food for thought.Things that are too far away for the eyes to see, have to be brought closer with a telescope. Conversely, things that are too near and attached and, therefore, defy perception, may become perceptible with detachment from a distance, putting aside the stereotypes thrust by the external world upon the internal psyche. Kit, the protagonist, takes his friend Doctor Adam Smith, the narrator, to this alien planet Hoola, millions of light years away from Earth. Hoola is a unique multi-coloured planet, and so is the alien Hoo race that lives on it. Kit vows to harmonise the Hoo race fragmented by their colour differences. The odds are heavily against him. A Sword of honour has to be recovered from the enemy. Ages old anomalies have to be set right. Kit’s unifying efforts inevitably produce ugly reactions from the divisive forces. He is abducted by a ruthless cunning despot. Death is the order for Kit. What happens then?In the end, was it all Doctor Adam’s dream or did he actually visit the planet Hoola?",9383416165,9789383416165),Paperback,First Edition,150 pages,"

","""The publication of Creatures of a Day is reason to celebrate."" --Steven PinkerIn this stunning collection of stories, renowned psychiatrist Irvin D. Yalom describes his patients' struggles--as well as his own--to come to terms with the two great challenges of existence: how to have a meaningful life yet reckon with its inevitable end. We meet a nurse who must stifle the pain of losing her son in order to comfort her patients' pains, a newly minted psychologist whose studies damage her treasured memories of a lost friend, and a man whose rejection of psychological inquiry forces even Yalom himself into a crisis of confidence.

Creatures of a Day is a radically honest statement about the difficulties of human life, but also a celebration of some of the finest fruits--love, family, friendship--it can offer. Marcus Aurelius has written that ""we are all creatures of a day."" With Yalom as our guide, we will find the means to make our own day not only bearable, but also meaningful and joyful.",0465029647,9780465029648),Hardcover,,215 pages,"

","Constituindo um espantoso fresco da Europa do século XVI — das intrigas políticas às querelas religiosas, da filosofia à vida quotidiana, da cultura literária às discussões científicas —, “A Obra ao Negro” é também a história pessoal de Zenão, o filho bastardo de um grande negociante de Bruges, cujo pai, que não chega a reconhecê-lo, era ainda aparentado com a poderosa família dos Médicis. Médico, filósofo e alquimista, podem ver-se na vida de Zenão, embora o romance não o assuma expressamente, as etapas da Grande Obra alquímica, com os seus momentos de decantação, dissipação e sublimação. O objectivo da alquimia, reclama a tradição, era o de transformar o próprio alquimista. A transmutação dos metais constituía apenas o seu fito aparente, a face visível de uma operação interior. Logo no primeiro capítulo deste romance, sintomaticamente intitulado “O Longo Caminho”, Zenão despedese de um primo, dizendo-lhe: “Há alguém à minha espera. Vou até lá.” Pergunta o interlocutor: “Quem é?” E Zenão responde: “Hic Zeno. Eu mesmo.”",8496075435,8496075435,Hardcover,Colecção: Mil Folhas #28,318 pages,"

","În lumea magică a Londrei Victoriene, Tessa Gray şi-a şăsit În Sfârşit Locul, Alături de vânătorii de umbre. Dar liniştea se dovedeşte a fi trecătoare când forţe întunecate din Conclav plănuiesc s-o înlăture pe Charlotte, protectoarea ei, de la conducerea Institutului. Dacă se va întâmpla acest lucru, Tessa va ajunge pe străzi, pradă uşoară pentru misteriosul Magistru, care urmăreşte să se folosească de puterile ei în scopuri nu tocmai nobile.Cu ajutorul lui Will şi Jem, Tessa descoperă că războiul purtat de Magistru împotriva vânătorilor de umbre este cât se poate de personal. El îi învinuieşte pentru o tragedie petrecută cu mult timp în urmă, din pricina căreia, susţine el, viaţa îi fusese distrusă. Pentru a descoperi secretele trecutului, cei trei prieteni călătoresc din Yorkshire-ul învăluit în ceaţă spre un conac de care sunt legate poveşti cumplite; din cartierele sărăcăcioase ale Londrei spre o sală de bal fermecătoare, unde Tessa descoperă că adevărul despre originile ei este mult mai sinistru decât îşi închipuise vreodată. Când se întâlnesc cu un demon mecanic, care-i transmite lui Will un avertisment, aceştia înţeleg că Magistrul le ştie fiecare mişcare – şi că unul dintre apropiaţii lor i-a trădat.Tessa realizează că inima îi bate din ce în ce mai tare pentru Jem, însă dorinţa de a fi cu Will, în pofida stărilor lui sumbre, continuă să o tulbure. Dar ceva se schimbă în Will – zidul pe care băiatul şi-l construise în jurul lui începe să se năruie. Dacă-l vor găsi pe Magistru, va putea oare Will să se elibereze de secretele sale şi să-i ofere Tessei răspunsurile legate de originea şi de menirea ei?În vreme ce căutarea Magistrului, dar şi a adevărului, îi pune pe cei trei prieteni în situaţii primejdioase, Tessa înţelege că, atunci când amesteci dragostea cu minciunile, poţi corupe chiar şi cea mai curată inimă.",9789731024332,9789731024332,Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","At sixteen, Kenn Kaufman dropped out of the high school where he was student council president and hit the road, hitching back and forth across America, from Alaska to Florida, Maine to Mexico. Maybe not all that unusual a thing to do in the seventies, but what Kenn was searching for was a little different: not sex, drugs, God, or even self, but birds. A report of a rare bird would send him hitching nonstop from Pacific to Atlantic and back again. When he was broke he would pick fruit or do odd jobs to earn the fifty dollars or so that would last him for weeks. His goal was to set a record - most North American species seen in a year - but along the way he began to realize that at this breakneck pace he was only looking, not seeing. What had been a game became a quest for a deeper understanding of the natural world. Kingbird Highway is a unique coming-of-age story, combining a lyrical celebration of nature with wild, and sometimes dangerous, adventures, starring a colorful cast of characters.",0618709401,9780618709403),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty. Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all. But Arlen Bales, the Warded Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honor refuse. Rather than risk defeat, Arlen cast them both from a precipice, leaving the world without a savior, and opening a struggle for succession that threatens to tear the Free Cities of Thesa apart. In the south, Inevera, Jardir’s first wife, must find a way to keep their sons from killing each other and plunging their people into civil war as they strive for glory enough to make a claim on the throne. In the north, Leesha Paper and Rojer Inn struggle to forge an alliance between the duchies of Angiers and Miln against the Krasians before it is too late. Caught in the crossfire is the duchy of Lakton--rich and unprotected, ripe for conquest. All the while, the corelings have been growing stronger, and without Arlen and Jardir there may be none strong enough to stop them. Only Renna Bales may know more about the fate of the missing men, but she, too, has disappeared...",0345531485,9780345531483),Hardcover,,681 pages,"

","#1 New York Times bestselling author Greg Iles continues the electrifying story he began in his smashing New York Times bestseller Natchez Burning with this highly anticipated second volume in an epic trilogy of blood and race, family and justice.Southern prosecutor Penn Cage is caught in the darkest maelstrom of his life. The heartbreaking but seemingly straightforward death of his father's African-American nurse, Viola Turner, has fractured Penn's family and turned Dr. Tom Cage into a fugitive from justice. And in the search for his father and his reasons for running, Penn has unwittingly started a war with a violent offshoot of the KKK, the Double Eagles, whose members seem to know much more about Tom's past than Penn or his mother ever did.Desperately following his father's trail, Penn finds himself in a maze of mirrors, beset on all sides by a family of criminals and corrupt police whose power reaches into the highest levels of state government. To even the odds, Penn must rely on allies whose objectives are very different from his own. FBI special agent John Kaiser sees Tom Cage as the key to closing not only countless civil rights murders, but also the ultimate cold case: the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Penn's fiancée, journalist Caitlin Masters, is chasing the biggest story of her career and believes Tom can lead her to evidence of America's most secret, shameful history. In the end, all roads will lead to the mysterious Bone Tree, a legendary killing site that may conceal far more than the remains of the forgotten.Penn now knows that the death of Viola Turner is a door to the darkest chapters of America's past. In the civil rights battleground that was 1960s Mississippi and Louisiana, powerful men had audacious, sweeping agendas, and their violent race murders concealed a conspiracy that ran wide and deep, involving the New Orleans Mafia, a Double Eagle hit squad, and a world- altering murder in Dealey Plaza in 1963. And if the FBI can be believed, somehow Dr. Tom Cage stands at the center of it all.Enthralling, captivating, and utterly engrossing, The Bone Tree is a masterpiece of modern suspense and the next novel in the monumental trilogy that Greg Iles was born to write.",0062311115,9780062311115),Hardcover,,804 pages,"

If anyone asks, I knew better than to flash my boobs for Mardi Gras beads.
  I still don’t know why I did it. Maybe it was the dare from my two best friends. Maybe it was the guys on the balcony saying they’d throw Fireball shots with the beads. Or maybe it was the quiet guy in the corner of that same balcony with piercing gray eyes, wavy dark hair, and a smile so tempting I wanted to climb up there and lick it off his face. Maybe it was because I never thought I’d see them again. Not that it matters. Not today. Because the hotel I manage was finally bought—and the guy who walks in and introduces himself as my new boss is Mr. Tall, Dark, and Silent.  There are many upsides to being single. Your new boss knowing what your boobs look like? Not one of them.

Problem was, these stories, many of which found their way into the general social consciousness, reflected the way in which these men lived and saw their world: that is, the stories were sexist, discriminatory, unfair, culturally biased, and in general, demeaning to witches, animals, goblins, and fairies everywhere.Finally, after centuries of these abusive tales, which have been handed down--unknowingly--from one male-biased generation to the next, James Finn Garner has taken it upon himself (that's right, yet another man) to enlighten and liberate these classic bedtime stories and retell them in a way that is much more in keeping with the society in which we live today.Politically Correct Bedtime Stories, then is the fruit of Garner's labors. We'd like to think that future generations of fairy-tale fans will see this as a worthy attempt to develop meaningful literature that is totally free from bias and purged from the influences of a flawed cultural past.",002542730X,9780025427303),Hardcover,First Edition,79 pages,"

","The first in-depth, behind-the-scenes look at the White House Chiefs of Staff, whose actions--and inactions--have defined the course of our country.What do Dick Cheney and Rahm Emanuel have in common? Aside from polarizing personalities, both served as chief of staff to the president of the United States--as did Donald Rumsfeld, Leon Panetta, and a relative handful of others. The chiefs of staff, often referred to as ""the gatekeepers,"" wield tremendous power in Washington and beyond; they decide who is allowed to see the president, negotiate with Congress to push POTUS's agenda, and--most crucially--enjoy unparalleled access to the leader of the free world. Each chief can make or break an administration, and each president reveals himself by the chief he picks.Through extensive, intimate interviews with all seventeen living chiefs and two former presidents, award-winning journalist and producer Chris Whipple pulls back the curtain on this unique fraternity. In doing so, he revises our understanding of presidential history, showing us how James Baker's expert managing of the White House, the press, and Capitol Hill paved the way for the Reagan Revolution--and, conversely, how Watergate, the Iraq War, and even the bungled Obamacare rollout might have been prevented by a more effective chief.Filled with shrewd analysis and never-before-reported details, The Gatekeepers offers an essential portrait of the toughest job in Washington.",1524722960,9781524722968),Audio CD,,,"

","""A memorable romantic thriller. Schiller nicely balances history and fiction.” -Publishers Weekly In the lush, tropical world of Martinique where slavery is a distant memory and voodoo holds sway, Emilie Dujon discovers that her fiancé, a rich sugar planter, has been unfaithful. Desperate to leave him, she elicits the aid of a voodoo witch doctor and is lured into a shadowy world of black magic and extortion. When the volcano known as Mount Pelée begins to rumble and spew ash, she joins a scientific committee sent to investigate the crater. During the journey she meets Lt. Denis Rémy, an army officer with a mysterious past. At the summit, the explorers discover that a second crater has formed and the volcano appears to be on the verge of eruption. But when they try to warn the governor, he orders them to bury the evidence for fear of upsetting the upcoming election. As the pressure builds, a deadly mudslide inundates Emilie’s plantation and she disappears. With ash and cinders raining down, chaos ensues. Left with no choice, Lt. Rémy deserts his post and sets off on a desperate quest to rescue Emilie. But with all roads blocked, can they escape the doomed city of St. Pierre before it’s too late?",English,English,Paperback,,270 pages,"

","Vent’anni fa, un’estate in Riviera, una di quelle estati che segnano la vita per sempre. Elio ha diciassette anni, e per lui sono appena iniziate le vacanze nella splendida villa di famiglia nel Ponente ligure. Figlio di un professore universitario, musicista sensibile, decisamente colto per la sua età, il ragazzo aspetta come ogni anno «l’ospite dell’estate, l’ennesima scocciatura»: uno studente in arrivo da New York per lavorare alla sua tesi di post dottorato. Ma Oliver, il giovane americano, conquista tutti con la sua bellezza e i modi disinvolti. Anche Elio ne è irretito. I due condividono, oltre alle origini ebraiche, molte passioni: discutono di film, libri, fanno lunghe passeggiate e nuotate. E tra loro nasce un desiderio inesorabile quanto inatteso, vissuto fino in fondo, dalla sofferenza all’estasi.Chiamami col tuo nome è la storia di un paradiso scoperto e già perduto, una meditazione proustiana sul tempo e sul desiderio, una domanda che resta aperta finché Elio e Oliver si ritroveranno un giorno a confessare a se stessi che «questa cosa che quasi non fu mai ancora ci tenta».",8823517575,9788823517578),Paperback,Narratori della Fenice,271 pages,"

His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation; his father was barred by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Cotton cannot vote because he, like many black men in the United States, has been labeled a felon and is currently on parole.""As the United States celebrates the nation's ""triumph over race"" with the election of Barack Obama, the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status--much like their grandparents before them.In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community--and all of us--to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America.",1595586431,9781595586438),Paperback,,312 pages,"

","Widely considered one of the great American novels, Herman Melville’s masterpiece went largely unread during his lifetime and was out of print at the time of his death in 1891. Called the greatest book about the sea ever written by D.H. Lawrence, Moby Dick features detailed descriptions of whale hunting and whale oil extraction as well as beautiful, incisive writing on race, class, religion, art, and society. The story, loosely based on a real whaling shipwreck, features the unforgettable, vengeful Captain Ahab, who obsessively hunts a great white whale who bit his leg off below the knee.",0143058096,9780143058090),Audio CD,Abridged,6 pages,"

","Oggi Marco è «il re indiscusso delle webstar italiane», secondo Le Iene, che gli hanno dedicato un lungo servizio, uno youtuber con milioni di visualizzazioni, che fa il tutto esaurito nei locali, è stato ospite delle principali trasmissioni tv ed è comparso al fianco di molte celebrities, come Paolo Ruffini, Barbara d'Urso, Gianni Morandi. I suoi tormentoni, da Saluta Andonio a Buonaseeera, vengono stampati su magliette e cover di cellulari. Ma prima del giorno in cui ha postato il video che l'ha reso celebre, la sua vita era semplicemente quella di un tredicenne di provincia, «vai all'Iper a fare un giro con gli amici, un panino al McDonald's, ti compri l'album della Champions... e niente». Un ragazzino che voleva divertirsi − e gli piace ancora − uno come tanti, insomma. Solamente con qualche chilo in più. E che per questo, ogni tanto, era costretto a chiudersi in casa e aspettare che l'occhio nero si sgonfiasse. È per sfidare i bulli che Marco inizia a fare video. Anche quel video: lui in macchina con il padre, che proprio non vuole saperne di salutare. «Saluta Andonio», ma Antonio non saluta. Non saluta mai. Nel giro di poche ore, il video impazza, diventa virale e la vita di Marco cambia. Tutti ora vogliono fare selfie con lui, anche i ragazzi e le ragazze che lo prendevano in giro, che lo bullizzavano, e adesso fanno a gara per stargli vicino. Un successo irrefrenabile, ma Marco sa tenere i piedi per terra, sa che il gioco può finire così come è iniziato, che deve fare di tutto per costruirsi un futuro. E vuole far sapere a quanti si nascondono pensando di non essere all'altezza, che la vita è anche un'altra, e che chiunque può viverla, a pieno.

","The final installment in Lyndsay Faye’s Timothy Wilde series, which Lee Child called “solid-gold” and Gillian Flynn declared “spectacular.” No one in 1840s New York likes fires, copper star Timothy Wilde least of all. After a blaze killed his parents and another left him with a terrible scar, he has avoided flames of all kinds. So when a seamstress turned arsonist threatens Robert Symmes, a corrupt tycoon high in the Tammany Hall ranks, Timothy isn’t thrilled that Symmes consults him. His dismay escalates when his audacious and charismatic older brother, Valentine, himself deeply politically entrenched, decides to run against the incumbent, who they suspect is guilty of assault and far darker crimes. Immediately after his brother’s courageous declaration, Timothy finds himself surrounded by powerful enemies who threaten to harm those he cares about most. Meanwhile, the love of Timothy’s life, Mercy Underhill, unexpectedly appears on his doorstep and takes under her wing a starving Irish orphan who may be the key to stopping the combustions threatening the city—if only they can make sense of her cryptic accounts. The closer they come to deciphering her wild tales of witches and angels, however, the closer Timothy comes to the fiery and shocking conclusion that forces him to face everything he fears most. A boisterous and suspenseful book from a master of historical adventure, The Fatal Flame is a tale for the ages.",0399169482,9780399169489),Hardcover,,463 pages,"

She didn't expect to find a place for herself among the group of fighters—a life of usefulness—and she certainly didn't expect to fall in love. Now she heads to the imperial castle to resume a life she never wanted to save the boy she loves. Ōkami has been captured, and his execution is a certainty. Mariko will do what she must to ensure his survival—even marry the sovereign's brother, saying goodbye to a life with Ōkami forever.As Mariko settles into her days at court—making both friends and enemies—and attempting Ōkami's rescue at night, the secrets of the royal court begin to unravel as competing agendas collide. One arrow sets into motion a series of deadly events even the most powerful magic cannot contain.

","In her first novel in verse, Anne Carson bridges the gap between classicism and the modern, poetry and prose, with a volcanic journey into the soul of a winged red monster named Geryon.There is a strong mixture of whimsy and sadness in Geryon's story. He is tormented as a boy by his brother, escapes to a parallel world of photography, and falls in love with Herakles--a golden young man who leaves Geryon at the peak of infatuation. Geryon retreats ever further into the world created by his camera, until that glass house is suddenly and irrevocably shattered by Herakles' return. Running throughout is Geryon's fascination with his wings, the color red, and the fantastic accident of who he is.Autobiography of Red is a deceptively simple narrative layered with currents of meaning, emotion, and the truth about what it's like to be red. It is a powerful and unsettling story that moves, disturbs, and delights.",0375401334,9780375401336),Hardcover,,149 pages,"

DIVERGENT is a major motion picture in 2014. Divergent: Sixteen-year-old Tris has been forced to make a terrible choice. In a divided society where everyone must conform, Tris does not fit. So she ventures out, alone, determined to find out where she truly belongs. Tris can trust no one in this brutal new world, but she is drawn to a boy who seems to both threaten and protect her. Insurgent: Tris has survived a brutal attack on her home, but she has paid a terrible price. Wracked by grief and guilt, she becomes reckless as she struggles to accept her new future. If Tris wants to uncover the truth, she must be stronger than ever as more shocking choices and sacrifices lie ahead. Allegiant: The faction-based society that Tris once believed in is shattered - fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she's known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she will find a simple new life, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties and painful memories. But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice and love.

","Politics of Piety is a groundbreaking analysis of Islamist cultural politics through the ethnography of a thriving, grassroots women's piety movement in the mosques of Cairo, Egypt. Unlike those organized Islamist activities that seek to seize or transform the state, this is a moral reform movement whose orthodox practices are commonly viewed as inconsequential to Egypt's political landscape. Saba Mahmood's compelling exposition of these practices challenges this assumption by showing how the ethical and the political are indelibly linked within the context of such movements.Not only is this book a sensitive ethnography of a critical but largely ignored dimension of the Islamic revival, it is also an unflinching critique of the secular-liberal principles by which some people hold such movements to account. The book addresses three central questions: How do movements of moral reform help us rethink the normative liberal account of politics? How does the adherence of women to the patriarchal norms at the core of such movements parochialize key assumptions within feminist theory about freedom, agency, authority, and the human subject? How does a consideration of debates about embodied religious rituals among Islamists and their secular critics help us understand the conceptual relationship between bodily form and political imaginaries? Politics of Piety is essential reading for anyone interested in issues at the nexus of ethics and politics, embodiment and gender, and liberalism and postcolonialism.",0691086958,9780691086958),Paperback,,233 pages,"

","È il racconto di come gli animali di una fattoria si ribellino e, dopo aver cacciato il proprietario, tentino di crare un nuovo ordine fondato su un concetto utopistico di uguaglianza. Ma ben presto emerge tra loro una nuova classe di burocrati, i maiali, che con la loro astuzia, la loro cupidigia e il loro egoismo s'impongono in modo prepotente e tirannico sugli altri animali più docili e semplici d'animo. Gli elevati ideali di uguaglianza e fraternità proclamati al tempo della rivoluzione vittoriosa vengono traditi e, sotto l'oppressione di Napoleon, il grosso maiale che riesce ad accentrare in sé tutte le leve del potere e ad appropriarsi degli utili della fattoria, tutti gli altri animali finiscono per conoscere gli stessi maltrattamenti e le stesse privazioni di prima. L'acuta satira orwelliana verso un certo tipo di totalitarismo, che ha avuto in Stalin la sua esemplificazione più clamorosa, è unita in questo apologo a una felicità inventiva e a un'energia stilistica che pongono ""La fattoria degli animali"" sulla linea della grande tradizione libellistica inglese del '700.","Snowball,",Benjamin...less,,,159 pages,"

She never expects that her new client, software mogul Deacon Whitney, would see more in her than just a talented gardener. Deacon has paid top dollar to the crews he’s hired to renovate the desolate Whitney estate—he had to, because the bumps, thumps, and unexplained sightings of ghostly figures in nineteenth-century dress are driving workers away faster than he can say “Boo.”But Nina shows no signs of being scared away, even as she experiences some unnerving apparitions herself. And as the two of them work closely together to restore the mansion’s faded glory, Deacon realizes that he’s found someone who doesn’t seem to like his fortune more than himself—while Nina may have finally found the one man she can trust with her bruised and battered heart.But something on the island doesn’t believe in true love…and if Nina and Deacon can’t figure out how to put these angry spirits to rest, their own love doesn’t stand a ghost of a chance.",147670600X,9781476706009),Mass Market Paperback,,318 pages,"

Now, he's sure he'll be the first man to die there.It started with the dust storm that holed his suit and nearly killed him, and that forced his crew to leave him behind, sure he was already dead. Now he's stranded millions of miles from the nearest human being, with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive--and even if he could get word out, his food would be gone years before a rescue mission could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old ""human error"" are much more likely to get him first.But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills--and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit--he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next.

War correspondent, ambulance driver, and big-game hunter, he was married four times and his love life was inextricably bound up with his artistic endeavors. His first marriage to Hadley Richardson—with whom he lived in Paris in the early 1920s—has long fascinated readers. Their passionate, complicated, and ultimately “doomed” relationship coincided with Hemingway’s formative years as a member of the so-called Lost Generation, and the failed marriage had a lifelong impact on the man and his writing.  In The Paris Husband, author and Hemingway scholar Scott Donaldson deftly separates fact from fiction to present a spellbinding and clear-eyed account of this seminal period in Hemingway’s life. Brilliantly utilizing all essential primary and secondary sources—including the author’s notebooks and drafts—Donaldson breathes new life into this ageless story, providing revelatory insights into Hemingway’s character and exploring the nuances of a magical, yet troubled, love affair.  For anyone interested in Hemingway’s development as an artist and why, as an older man, he continued to revisit this transformative and painful episode in his life, The Paris Husband is a lucid, accessible, and compelling narrative that will engage both diehard Hemingway fans, as well as those just discovering this iconic writer.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Kindle Edition,,101 pages,"

It's symbolically based on the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, with a spiritual lesson to take away from it. Action packed thriller with a deep message.  A book report on this particular novel would give your kid genius credibility over night. It was written with a lot of room for analysis, and the book report format was kept in mind. It's book report friendly, if you will. Very easy to read conversational narration with comfortable dialog, making complex ideas sink in innately. It contains instructions on how to strengthen your compassion and humility within the story the way there are secrets in the torah. This is my masterpiece. Get a copy for your high schooler.

","Tracing runemagic as a Pyromancer is a lot like being burned alive. So why does it feel so amazing?  Jaxon is an elite Warrior who has lost the most precious thing in the world.  Dionna is an average Pyromancer — a fire-wielding sorceress — hoping only to pass her Academy Assessment.  But all of Dionna’s concerns become trivial when the Academy is attacked by the Silithik Hivemind: a race of monstrous insects that kill most of her fellow students in a savage sneak attack.  As one of the few survivors, Dionna is thrust into a Dragon Quintelaide, an elite fighting unit made up of each of the fighting professions. She knows she’s not ready for such a drastic promotion — and the men she’s with, led by the massive Warrior Jaxon, know it too.  Yet Jaxon feels strongly protective of Dionna. And he can't shake the feeling...  As the war against the Silithik is reignited, Dionna needs to convince her Quintmates to trust her… while first learning to trust herself. Can she prove her worth as a Pyromancer? Or will Jaxon and the others abandon her for their own selfish mission?  DRAGON ORIGINS is the new Reverse Harem Dragon Shifter Romance series from Ruby Ryan. The prequel series to the GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS series, it has heart-stopping medieval warfare, an exciting and unique magic system, and all the steamy romance you’ve come to expect from a Reverse Harem. With five dashing men to choose from — the mighty Warrior Jaxon, the thoughtful Frost Mage Arthur, the precise Ranger Harry, the easy-to-smile Tinker Maze, and the sly and cunning Shadow Ryon — who will win Dionna's heart?",English,English,Kindle Edition,,394 pages,"

","The summer sun beat heavily on the tiny inlet off the broad river. Large trees, untouched by civilization, surrounded the inlet on three sides. The fourth side was a narrow waterway leading back to the river. Wild birds abounded, and on land, small game lived without fear of being attacked and killed by larger animals. Nor did they fear the worst predator of all: man. It was too early for mosquitoes. Everything was quiet and peaceful.The little cabin cruiser sat silently in the middle of the inlet, at anchor. It had arrived the previous night and would be gone when daylight started fading. This was the last day of the Rheingold's honeymoon. They had rented the cabin cruiser for two days, and Herb Rheingold had found the inlet quite by accident.At the moment, Herb, his wife Emily, and Emily's daughter by a previous marriage, Wendy, were relaxing on deck. Emily, tall, slender, with jet-black hair, had an excellent figure, and didn't mind showing it off wearing the briefest of bikinis.Her bikini was as black as her ebony hair, hiding her dark bush of pubic curls, though the hairs did stick out around the sides of the crotch band. Her tan thighs were long, slender and firm, with no stretch marks. In fact, although the woman was thirty-four, she looked at least ten years younger. Her fingernails and toenails were painted blood red, and her short, midnight hair was in an up-sweep.Cornering Herb Rheingold had been quite a feat for the divorcee. True, the man wasn't rich, but he had a good job as a real estate broker, and considering her condition when he and she had first met, she was ten times better off.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,,"

","Tempe's work at the Jeffersonian Institute is put on hold when Special Agent Seeley Booth, stalled on a case deposing a Chicago mob family, calls her in to assist with a bizarre discovery: a plastic bag of skeletal remainsmdash;and a chilling note—left on the steps of a federal building. Tempe determines the bones are from different corpses, suggesting a serial killer's handiwork. A suspect is quickly taken into custody, but Tempe senses the case is far from closed. And as Booth's Mafia case heats up with violent twists and bloody discoveries, including ties to one of Chicago's most gruesome and notorious killers, Tempe must unravel the story of the bones, where the truth lies buried—in order to stay alive.",2265085243,2265085243,Mass Market Paperback,,,"

","In the early 1900s, teenaged Sunja, the adored daughter of a crippled fisherman, falls for a wealthy stranger at the seashore near her home in Korea. He promises her the world, but when she discovers she is pregnant--and that her lover is married--she refuses to be bought. Instead, she accepts an offer of marriage from a gentle, sickly minister passing through on his way to Japan. But her decision to abandon her home, and to reject her son's powerful father, sets off a dramatic saga that will echo down through the generations. Richly told and profoundly moving, Pachinko is a story of love, sacrifice, ambition, and loyalty. From bustling street markets to the halls of Japan's finest universities to the pachinko parlors of the criminal underworld, Lee's complex and passionate characters--strong, stubborn women, devoted sisters and sons, fathers shaken by moral crisis--survive and thrive against the indifferent arc of history.",1455563927,9781455563920),Paperback,,502 pages,"

","Considered by many to be one of Brecht's masterpieces, Galileo explores the question of a scientist's social and ethical responsibility, as the brilliant Galileo must choose between his life and his life's work when confronted with the demands of the Inquisition. Through the dramatic characterization of the famous physicist, Brecht examines the issues of scientific morality and the difficult relationship between the intellectual and authority. This version of the play is the famous one that was brought to completion by Brecht himself, working with Charles Laughton, who played Galileo in the first two American productions (Hollywood and New York, 1947). Since then the play has become a classic in the world repertoire. ""The play which most strongly stamped on my mind a sense of Brecht's great stature as an artist of the modern theatre was Galileo."" - Harold Clurman; ""Thoughtful and profoundly sensitive."" - Newsweek.",0802130593,9780802130594),Paperback,,155 pages,"

","Chega ao Brasil o bestseller Eragon, primeiro volume da tetralogia da Herança, do norte-americano Christopher Paolini. Com mais de quatro milhões de exemplares vendidos em 38 países, o livro atingiu o topo da lista dos mais vendidos do New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today e Publishers Weekly. No rastro do sucesso de outros títulos de fantasia, como Harry Potter e O senhor dos anéis, Eragon também chega às telas dos cinemas mundiais em 2006, pela Fox.Lançado inicialmente com a ajuda da família, quando Paolini ainda era aluno do ensino médio e tinha apenas 15 anos, o livro chegou rapidamente às mãos do editor Alfred A. Knopf e se transformou em sucesso mundial de vendas, comercializado pela gigante Random House. Nos Estados Unidos, o título manteve-se por 52 semanas no topo da lista dos mais vendidos. Em apenas seis meses, Eragon foi reeditado por três vezes na Turquia. Na Espanha, a edição de 80 mil exemplares esgotou-se em apenas um mês. Na Polônia, o título de Paolini só perde em vendas para o O Código Da Vinci e já vendeu 45 mil exemplares.Eragon é uma história repleta de ação, vilões e locais fantásticos, com dragões e elfos, cavaleiros, luta de espada, inesperadas revelações e uma linda donzela. Inspirado em J.R.R. Tolkien, que criou idiomas para os diálogos de seus personagens, Paolini utiliza o norueguês medieval para a linguagem dos elfos e inventa expressões específicas para os anões e os urgals, de modo a dar veracidade ao lendário reino de Alagaësia, onde a guerra está prestes a começar.O protagonista é um jovem de 15 anos que, ao encontrar na floresta uma pedra azul polida, se vê da noite para o dia no meio de uma disputa pelo poder do Império, na qual ele é a peça principal. A vida de Eragon muda radicalmente ao descobrir que a pedra azul é, na realidade, um ovo de dragão. Quando a pedra se rompe e dela nasce Saphira, Eragon é forçado a se converter em herói.Involuntariamente, o jovem é lançado para um arriscado mundo novo movido pelas tramas do destino, da magia e do poder. Empunhando apenas uma espada lendária e seguindo as sábias palavras de um velho contador de histórias, Eragon e o leal dragão terão de se aventurar por terras perigosas e enfrentar inimigos das trevas em um Império governado por um rei cuja maldade não conhece fronteiras.A Eragon foi dada a responsabilidade de alcançar a glória dos lendários heróis da Ordem dos Cavaleiros de Dragões. Será que conseguirá vencer os obstáculos que o destino lhe reservou? As escolhas de Eragon poderão salvar – ou destruir – o mundo em que vive.",8532518486,9788532518484),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","El titulo evoca al protagonista de la Odisea de Homero, cuyo hilo argumental es seguido por Joyce con un sentido irónico y burlesco. Esta nueva odisea esta protagonizada por un hombre de clase media, Leopold Bloom, que tiene que afrontar asuntos problemáticos relacionados con la familia, la Iglesia y el Estado a lo largo de 24 horas que dura el relato. Uno de los mayores logros de la novela es el monologo interior, tanto del personaje central (al estilo del examen de conciencia jesuitico) como de su esposa, Molly Bloom. Es una obra fundamental de la literatura universal, considerada obra maestra y genial, constantemente citada y admirada como obra de referencia por todos los escritores.

Someone she can talk to and share secrets with. But that's tough when your grandmother is a Yaga, a guardian who guides the dead into the afterlife. It's even harder when you live in a house that wanders all over the world . . . carrying you with it. Even worse, Marinka is being trained to be a Yaga. That means no school, no parties--and no playmates that stick around for more than a day. So when Marinka stumbles across the chance to make a real friend, she breaks all the rules . . . with devastating consequences. Her beloved grandmother mysteriously disappears, and it's up to Marinka to find her--even if it means making a dangerous journey to the afterlife.

After departing the SEAL Teams, they launched Echelon Front, a company that teaches these same leadership principles to businesses and organizations. From promising startups to Fortune 500 companies, Babin and Willink have helped scores of clients across a broad range of industries build their own high-performance teams and dominate their battlefields.Now, detailing the mind-set and principles that enable SEAL units to accomplish the most difficult missions in combat, Extreme Ownership shows how to apply them to any team, family or organization. Each chapter focuses on a specific topic such as Cover and Move, Decentralized Command, and Leading Up the Chain, explaining what they are, why they are important, and how to implement them in any leadership environment.A compelling narrative with powerful instruction and direct application, Extreme Ownership revolutionizes business management and challenges leaders everywhere to fulfill their ultimate purpose: lead and win.",1250067057,9781250067050),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan.

","Totalitarizmin kendini yeniden üretmesi, yalnızca baskıcı güçlerin zora dayalı yöntemleriyle değil, bireylerin de sınırlı bir özgürlüğe razı olmasıyla gerçekleşir. Yaratıcılığını zorlayarak özgürlüğünü zenginleştirme çabasına girmeyen birey, var olanla yaşamayı seçer. Bu noktada düzen, bireyin onayıyla ayakta kalıyordur artık. “Seçme özgürlüğü” düzenin sunduğu çeşitlilik oranında vardır: “Ya şu ya da bu”dur. Gündüz Vassaf ise böylesi bir “seçme özgürlüğü”nün tutsaklaştırıcı yanlarına dikkat çekerek “ya hep ya da hiç”i önerir... Ve totalitarizmi ayakta tutan kimi kavramların ne denli kof olduğunu gösterir: Gündüze karşı geceden, cennete karşı cehennemden, konuşmaya karşı sessizlikten, akla karşı delilikten, anlaşmaya karşı anlaşmazlıktan... yana olur. Kahramanlığa karşı çıkar, “hain”leri savunur...“En azından, ortaya konulan ‘metin’ anlamında özgür bir ‘kafa’ var karşımızda. ‘Kafasız bir dünya’ ya da ‘Dünyasız bir kafa’dan sıyrılıyor Vassaf. Yaratıcı bir ‘karışıklık’tan ve ‘düzensizlik’ten zerre kadar korkmuyor.”Tunca Arslan / 2000’e Doğru“Şeytanın avukatlığı konusunda son derece içten olan bir yazardan, zaman zaman neredeyse edebi tatlar da taşıyan çarpıcı denemeler. Bu kitabı çok sevebilirsiniz ya da sinir olabilirsiniz; ama kayıtsız kalmayın.”Murat Aykul / Aktüel“Gündüz Vassaf bizim bu duygularımızı kıpırdatmaya çalışıyor. Onu okurken hem heyecan duyuyor hem de yazdıklarına tepki duyuyoruz. Kıpırdayan duyularımız ile aklımız arasındaki mesafesel ilişki koparılıyor: Özgürcesine havalanıyor, bir boşlukta yere düşmeden evvel duyulan heyecanı, terleyerek taşıyoruz.”Ali Akay / Varlık“Belki de bu dönemle başedebilmemiz, kültür tarihinin birçok geçmiş başarısına birden başvurmamızla olanaklı olacak. Vassaf’ın kitabı da bu başvuru için el altında tutmamız gereken bir kitap.”Oruç Aruoba / Cumhuriyet Kitap“Epey cüretli bir deneme: Oralardan bir tek tanrı bakabilir çünkü; bir de şeytan tabii.

We must endeavor to embark upon this life-altering voyage of The Resurgence of African Awareness and African Consciousness and culture. Some of you are many moons into this journey. However, for some, this journey will be challenging, as taking a final exam, while standing on one leg and a barking dog in the background. For others, it will be like trying to walk on a broken leg without the assistance of a pair of crutches. In any event, successful completion is the only option. For those who are ready, willing to grow, heal, change and build perhaps this Book will challenge your minds to research and learn about yourselves and the resurgence of African Awareness and Culture. Black Culture has become this degenerative society where love, peace, joy & the pursuit of happiness is foreign and looks more like the dysfunction of a low-life animalistic society with horrible behaviors. A Majority of Teachers did not lecture students about real African history or culture. It would have enhanced your self-awareness, personal and spiritual growth. Learning who you are and where you originated is imperative for clarity, vitality, and freedom. This Book will challenge you to transform your mind. No more upside down, inside out and backward thinking of an enslaved mind. It's time to be Free. I challenge you to take this Journey.

THE MELODIOUS CHILD DEAD IN ME LONG BEFORE THE AX CHOPS OFF MY HEAD 
 Genet is related to that family of people who are nowadays referred to by the barbaric name of pass?istes. 1 An accident riveted him to a childhood memory, and this memory became sacred. In his early childhood, a liturgical drama was performed, a drama of which he was the officiant: he knew paradise and lost it, he was a child and was driven from his childhood. No doubt this ""break"" is not easy to localize. It shifts back and forth, at the dictate of his moods and myths, between the ages of ten and fifteen. But that is unimportant. What matters is that it exists and that he believes in it. His life is divided into two heterogeneous parts: before and after the sacred drama. Indeed, it is not unusual for the memory to condense into a single mythical moment the contingencies and perpetual rebeginnings of an individual history. What matters is that Genet lives and continues to relive this period of his life as if it had lasted only an instant. ____________________    1  Pass?iste: one who is not adapted to the present age, who is not a man of his time, who ""lives in the past.""--Translator's note.    ____________________  ? ? To say ""instant"" is to say fatal instant. The instant is the reciprocal and contradictory envelopment of the before by the after. One is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become. One lives one's death, one dies one's life. One feels oneself to be one's own self and another; the eternal is present in an atom of duration. In the midst of the fullest life, one has a foreboding that one will merely survive, one is afraid of the future. It is the time of anguish and of heroism, of pleasure and of destruction. An instant is sufficient to destroy, to enjoy, to kill, to be killed, to make one's fortune at the turn of a card. Genet carries in his heart a bygone instant which has lost none of its virulence, an infinitesimal and sacred void which concludes a death and begins a horrible metamorphosis. The argument of this liturgical drama is as follows: a child dies of shame; a hoodlum rises up in his place; the hoodlum will be haunted by the child. One would have to speak of resurrection, to evoke the old initiatory rites of shamanism and secret societies, were it not that Genet refuses categorically to be a man who has been resuscitated. 2 There was a death, that is all. And Genet is nothing other than a dead man. If he appears to be still alive, it is with the larval existence which certain peoples ascribe to their defunct in the grave. All his heroes have died at least once in their life.  ""After his first murder, Querelle experienced the feeling of being dead. . . . His human form--what is called the envelope of flesh-continued nevertheless to move about on the surface of the earth.""  His works are filled with meditations on death. The peculiarity of these spiritual exercises is that they almost never concern his future death, his being-to-die, but rather his being-dead, his death as past event.  This original crisis also appears to him as a metamorphosis. The well-behaved child is suddenly transformed into a hoodlum, as Gregor Samsa was changed into a bug. Genet's attitude toward this metamorphosis is ambivalent: he both loathes it and yearns for it. ",0394715837,9780394715834),Paperback,,625 pages,"

","Alternate Cover Edition can be found here. The eagerly awaited sequel to the #1 New York Times bestselling Words of Radiance, from epic fantasy author Brandon Sanderson at the top of his game.In Oathbringer, the third volume of the New York Times bestselling Stormlight Archive, humanity faces a new Desolation with the return of the Voidbringers, a foe with numbers as great as their thirst for vengeance.Dalinar Kholin's Alethi armies won a fleeting victory at a terrible cost: The enemy Parshendi summoned the violent Everstorm, which now sweeps the world with destruction, and in its passing awakens the once peaceful and subservient parshmen to the horror of their millennia-long enslavement by humans. While on a desperate flight to warn his family of the threat, Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with the fact that the newly kindled anger of the parshmen may be wholly justified.Nestled in the mountains high above the storms, in the tower city of Urithiru, Shallan Davar investigates the wonders of the ancient stronghold of the Knights Radiant and unearths dark secrets lurking in its depths. And Dalinar realizes that his holy mission to unite his homeland of Alethkar was too narrow in scope. Unless all the nations of Roshar can put aside Dalinar's blood-soaked past and stand together--and unless Dalinar himself can confront that past--even the restoration of the Knights Radiant will not prevent the end of civilization.",057509334X,9780575093348),Paperback,,1248 pages,"

","There is a fundamental opportunity for happiness right within our reach, yet we usually miss it—ironically while we are caught up in attempts to escape pain and suffering. Drawn from traditional Buddhist wisdom, Pema Chödrön's radical and compassionate advice for what to do when things fall apart in our lives goes against the grain of our usual habits and expectations. There is only one approach to suffering that is of lasting benefit, Pema teaches, and that approach involves moving toward painful situations with friendliness and curiosity, relaxing into the essential groundlessness of our entire situation. It is there, in the midst of chaos, that we can discover the truth and love that are indestructible. The Shambhala Library is a series of exquisitely designed and produced cloth editions of the world's spiritual and literary classics, both ancient and modern. Perfect for collecting or as gifts, each volume features a sewn binding, decorative endsheets, and a ribbon marker—in a delightful-to-hold 4¼ x 6¾ trim size.",1570629692,9781570629693),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","Our obsession with bigger and faster is spinning us out of control. We move through the week breathless and bustling, just trying to keep up while longing to slow down. But real life happens in the small moments, the kind we find on Tuesday, the most ordinary day of the week. Tuesday carries moments we want to hold onto--as well as ones we'd rather leave behind. It hold secrets we can't see in a hurry--secrets not just for our schedules but for our souls. It offers us a simple bench on which to sit, observe, and share our stories. For those being pulled under by the strong current of expectation, comparison, and hurry, relief is found more in our small moments than in our fast movements. In ""Simply Tuesday,"" Emily P. Freeman helps readers - stop dreading small beginnings and embrace today's work- find contentment in the now--even when the now is frustrating or discouraging- replace competition with compassion- learn to breathe in a breathless world Jesus lived small moments well, slow moments fully, and all moments free. He lives with us still, on all our ordinary days, creating and redeeming the world both in us and through us, one small moment at a time. It's time to take back Tuesday, to release our obsession with building a life, and believe in the life Christ is building in us--every day.",English,English,Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Albert Einstein is an icon of the twentieth century. Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, he is most famous for his theory of relativity. He also made enormous contributions to quantum mechanics and cosmology, and for his work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. A self-pronounced pacifist, humanist, and, late in his life, democratic socialist, Einstein was also deeply concerned with the social impact of his discoveries. Much of Einstein's life is shrouded in legend. From popular images and advertisements to various works of theater and fiction, he has come to signify so many things. In Einstein: A Biography, Jürgen Neffe presents a clear and probing portrait of the man behind the myth. Unearthing new documents, including a series of previously unknown letters from Einstein to his sons, which shed new light on his role as a father, Neffe paints a rich portrait of the tumultuous years in which Einstein lived and worked. And with a background in the sciences, he describes and contextualizes Einstein's enormous contributions to our scientific legacy. Einstein, a breakout bestseller in Germany, is sure to be a classic biography of the man and proverbial genius who has been called ""the brain of the [twentieth] century.""",0374146640,9780374146641),Hardcover,,480 pages,"

","“I find it so easy to forget / that I’m just a girl who is expected / to live / without thoughts.” Opposing slavery in Cuba in the nineteenth century was dangerous. The most daring abolitionists were poets who veiled their work in metaphor. Of these, the boldest was Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, nicknamed Tula. In passionate, accessible verses of her own, Engle evokes the voice of this book-loving feminist and abolitionist who bravely resisted an arranged marriage at the age of fourteen, and was ultimately courageous enough to fight against injustice.

","(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)Joan Didion’s incomparable and distinctive essays and journalism are admired for their acute, incisive observations and their spare, elegant style. Now the seven books of nonfiction that appeared between 1968 and 2003 have been brought together into one thrilling collection.Slouching Towards Bethlehem captures the counterculture of the sixties, its mood and lifestyle, as symbolized by California, Joan Baez, Haight-Ashbury. The White Album covers the revolutionary politics and the “contemporary wasteland” of the late sixties and early seventies, in pieces on the Manson family, the Black Panthers, and Hollywood. Salvador is a riveting look at the social and political landscape of civil war. Miami exposes the secret role this largely Latin city played in the Cold War, from the Bay of Pigs through Watergate. In After Henry Didion reports on the Reagans, Patty Hearst, and the Central Park jogger case. The eight essays in Political Fictions–on censorship in the media, Gingrich, Clinton, Starr, and “compassionate conservatism,” among others–show us how we got to the political scene of today. And in Where I Was From Didion shows that California was never the land of the golden dream.",0307264874,9780307264879),Hardcover,,1122 pages,"

","As far as Peg Shaw is concerned, midlife and menopause have brought enough sweat and excitement to last a lifetime. Unfortunately, there are others who disagree. One night while stumbling back to bed from her nightly visit to the bathroom, Peg is stopped in her tracks by two women standing in her bedroom. As her husband sleeps soundly, Peg abruptly realizes that ghosts have come calling: one is her dead grandmother and the other is her spirit guide.  After her grandmother asks her to partner with other spirits to help law enforcement solve crimes, Peg reluctantly agrees to help bring justice to the deceased but persistent ghosts of a local couple. After Peg discovers that cold cases are much more difficult to eliminate than her hot flashes, she travels into unfamiliar territory where her inexperience with murder becomes no match for her determination to rid herself of her uninvited, heartbeat-less guests. After enlisting help from old friends and unexpected allies, Peg uncovers a dark secret at the heart of her sleepy township with the potential to bring more trouble than she bargained for.  In this paranormal adventure tale, a middle-aged woman in the throes of menopause is thrust into solving local crimes, with help from her new friends from Deadsville.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Kindle Edition,,249 pages,"

","Moral and social philosophers often assume that humans beings are and ought to be autonomous. This tradition of individualism, or atomism, underlies many of our assumptions about ethics and law; it provides a legitimating framework for liberal democracy and free market capitalism. In this powerful book, David Weissman argues against atomistic ontologies, affirming instead that all of reality is social. Every particular is a system created by the reciprocal causal relations of its parts, he explains. Weissman formulates an original metaphysics of nature that remains true to what is known through the empirical sciences, and he applies his hypothesis to a range of topics in psychology, morals, sociology, and politics. The author contends that systems are sometimes mutually independent, but many systems, and human ones especially, are joined in higher order systems, such as families, friendships, businesses, and states, that are overlapping or nested. Weissman tests this schematic claim with empirical examples in chapters on persons, sociality, and value. He also considers how the scheme applies to particular issues related to deliberation, free speech, conflict, and ecology.",0300079036,9780300079036),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

Sylvie, the beautiful, brilliant, successful older daughter of the Lee family, flies to the Netherlands for one final visit with her dying grandmother—and then vanishes.Amy, the sheltered baby of the Lee family, is too young to remember a time when her parents were newly immigrated and too poor to keep Sylvie. Seven years older, Sylvie was raised by a distant relative in a faraway, foreign place, and didn’t rejoin her family in America until age nine. Timid and shy, Amy has always looked up to her sister, the fierce and fearless protector who showered her with unconditional love.But what happened to Sylvie? Amy and her parents are distraught and desperate for answers. Sylvie has always looked out for them. Now, it’s Amy’s turn to help. Terrified yet determined, Amy retraces her sister’s movements, flying to the last place Sylvie was seen. But instead of simple answers, she discovers something much more valuable: the truth.

Após a publicação de A Brincadeira (1967), que lhe conferiu uma notoriedade imediata, e de O Livro dos Amores Risíveis (1969 – Prémio da União Latina dos Escritores Checoslovacos), é vítima da repressão soviética a seguir ao esmagamento da Primavera de Praga. Os seus livros são interditos, é proibido de trabalhar e perde o direito de publicar. Em 1975, foge para Paris, onde vive desde então, tornando-se cidadão francês em 1981, após lhe ter sido retirada a nacionalidade checoslovaca, como consequência da publicação em França de O Livro do Riso e do Esquecimento. Toda a sua obra está traduzida em Portugal. Entre outros prémios, Milan Kundera recebeu, pelo conjunto da sua obra, o Commom Wealth Award (1981), o Prémio Jerusalém (1985) e o Prémio Nacional de Literatura da República Checa (2007).

","New York Times BestsellerIn this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be ""positive"" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. ""F**k positivity,"" Mark Manson says. ""Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—""not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault."" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.",0062641549,9780062641540),Paperback,,212 pages,"

","“I don’t entirely understand how anyone gets a boyfriend. Or a girlfriend. It just seems like the most impossible odds. You have to have a crush on the exact right person at the exact right moment. And they have to like you back.”What does a sixteen-year-old girl have to do to kiss a boy? Molly Peskin-Suso wishes she knew. She’s crushed on twenty-six guys…but has kissed exactly none. Her twin sister Cassie’s advice to “just go for it” and “take a risk” isn’t that helpful. It’s easy for her to say: she’s had flings with lots of girls. She’s fearless and effortlessly svelte, while Molly is introverted and what their grandma calls zaftig.Then Cassie meets Mina, and for the first time ever, Cassie is falling in love. While Molly is happy for her twin, she can’t help but feel lonelier than ever. But Cassie and Mina are determined to end Molly’s string of unrequited crushes once and for all. They decide to set her up with Mina’s friend Will, who is ridiculously good-looking, flirty, and seems to be into Molly. Perfect, right? But as Molly spends more time with Reid, her cute, nerdy co-worker, her feelings get all kinds of complicated. Now she has to decide whether to follow everyone’s advice…or follow her own heart.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,352 pages,"

","Known in his lifetime primarily to readers of science fiction, Philip K. Dick is now seen as a uniquely visionary figure, a writer who, in editor Jonathan Lethem’s words, “wielded a sardonic yet heartbroken acuity about the plight of being alive in the twentieth century, one that makes him a lonely hero to the readers who cherish him.”This Library of America volume brings together four of Dick’s most original novels. The Man in the High Castle (1962), which won the Hugo Award, describes an alternate world in which Japan and Germany have won World War II and America is divided into separate occupation zones. The dizzying The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) posits a future in which competing hallucinogens proffer different brands of virtual reality, and an interplanetary drug tycoon can transform himself into a godlike figure transcending even physical death.Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968), about a bounty hunter in search of escaped androids in a postapocalyptic society where status is measured by the possession of live animals and religious life is focused on a television personality, was the basis for the movie Blade Runner. Ubik (1969), with its future world of psychic espionage agents and cryonically frozen patients inhabiting an illusory “half-life,” pursues Dick’s theme of simulated realities and false perceptions to ever more disturbing conclusions, as time collapses on itself and characters stranded in past eras search desperately for the elusive, constantly shape-shifting panacea Ubik. As with most of Dick’s novels, no plot summary can suggest the mesmerizing and constantly surprising texture of these astonishing books.Posing the questions “What is human?” and “What is real?” in a multitude of fascinating ways, Dick produced works—fantastic and weird, yet developed with precise logic, marked by wild humor and soaring flights of religious speculation—that are startlingly prescient imaginative anticipations of 21st-century quandaries.",1598530097,9781598530094),Hardcover,,830 pages,"

Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge. With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.Cheng Xin, an aerospace engineer from the early twenty-first century, awakens from hibernation in this new age. She brings with her knowledge of a long-forgotten program dating from the beginning of the Trisolar Crisis, and her very presence may upset the delicate balance between two worlds.

Florist. Psychic. Addict.
 Laurence Riley coasts by on good looks and natural charm, but underneath lies a dark chasm that neither heroin nor lovers can fill. Sobriety is a pipe dream which his stalker ex-boyfriend is pushing him away from. Luckily, Laurence has powers most can only dream of. If only he could control them.  
Aristocrat. Psychic. Survivor.
 Quentin d'Arcy is the product of centuries of wealth, privilege, and breeding, and is on the run from all three. A chance encounter with an arresting young florist with a winning smile could make him stop. Laurence is kind, warm, and oddly intriguing but Quentin's wild telekinesis and his fear of sex make dating a dangerous game.  
When opposites attract, they collide.
 Desperate to fix his rotting life, Laurence prays for aid and accidentally summons a fertility god who prefers to be called Jack. Jack is willing to help out for a price, and it's one Laurence just can't pay: he must keep Jack fed with regular offerings of sex, and the florist has fallen for the one man in San Diego who doesn't want any.  If they're to survive Jack's wrath, Laurence and Quentin must master their blossoming feelings and gifts, but even then the cost of Laurence's mistake could well overwhelm them both. How exactly are mere mortals supposed to defeat a god?  Jack of Thorns is the first book in the award winning Inheritance series and contains mature themes and events which may be distressing to some readers.",B075SZ7ZPD,B075SZ7ZPD,Kindle Edition,2 edition,442 pages,"

","She awoke in an alley to the splash of rain. She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide. Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future. But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be...",0345395379,9780345395375),Paperback,,352 pages,"

I gasped, or tried to. My mouth opened, but I couldn’t draw breath. His lips, pearly wet, parted and he blew into my mouth. My lungs expanded beneath his weight. When I exhaled he sucked my breath in and his weight turned from cold marble into warm living flesh.
Since accepting a teaching position at remote Fairwick College in upstate New York, Callie McFay has experienced the same disturbingly sensual dream every night: A mist enters her bedroom, then takes the shape of a virile, seductive stranger who proceeds to ravish her in the most toe-curling, wholly satisfying ways possible. Perhaps these dreams are the result of her having written the bestselling book The Sex Lives of Demon Lovers. Callie’s lifelong passion is the intersection of lurid fairy tales and Gothic literature—which is why she’s found herself at Fairwick’s renowned folklore department, living in a once-stately Victorian house that, at first sight, seemed to call her name. But Callie soon realizes that her dreams are alarmingly real. She has a demon lover—an incubus—and he will seduce her, pleasure her, and eventually suck the very life from her. Then Callie makes another startling discovery: Her incubus is not the only mythical creature in Fairwick. As the tenured witches of the college and the resident fairies in the surrounding woods prepare to cast out the demon, Callie must accomplish something infinitely more difficult—banishing this supernatural lover from her heart.",0345510089,9780345510082),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","In the bitter winter of 1920, the first body is found in Delano, Georgia; the naked corpse of an unidentified teenager. There is no direct evidence of murder, but the body bears marks of what seems to be a ritual beating. The investigation falls to Will Henry Lee, a failed cotton farmer newly appointed as Delano's first chief of police. Lee's obsession with the crime begins a story that weaves through the decades, following the life of a small southern town and the role of three police chiefs in unraveling the crime. Chiefs is the best kind of thriller, where the investigation plays out against the drama beneath the surface of a seemingly placid community, seething with the pressures of race, love, hate, and; always; political power, extending from the town fathers all the way to Washington, DC. With a new foreword by the author, this volume will be a collector's treasure for all fans of Stuart Woods.",0393014614,9780393014617),Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","From Edward Rutherfurd, the grand master of the historical novel, comes a dazzling epic about the magnificent city of Paris. Moving back and forth in time, the story unfolds through intimate and thrilling tales of self-discovery, divided loyalty, and long-kept secrets. As various characters come of age, seek their fortunes, and fall in and out of love, the novel follows nobles who claim descent from the hero of the celebrated poem The Song of Roland; a humble family that embodies the ideals of the French Revolution; a pair of brothers from the slums behind Montmartre, one of whom works on the Eiffel Tower as the other joins the underworld near the Moulin Rouge; and merchants who lose everything during the reign of Louis XV, rise again in the age of Napoleon, and help establish Paris as the great center of art and culture that it is today. With Rutherfurd’s unrivaled blend of impeccable research and narrative verve, this bold novel brings the sights, scents, and tastes of the City of Light to brilliant life.",0345530764,9780345530769),Paperback,,809 pages,"

","An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here.The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. ""World War Z"" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.  Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.  Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""  Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war:  ""I found 'Patient Zero' behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was 'cursed.' I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse."" -- Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China""'Shock and Awe'? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can't be shocked and awed? Not just won't, but biologically can't That's what happened that day outside New York City, that's the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn't shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us They're not afraid No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid "" -- Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers""Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth."" -- General Travis D'Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe",0307346617,9780307346612),Paperback,,342 pages,"

But all that changed when his commander, as a part of a twisted scheme to force America's continued involvement in the Middle East, ordered an innocent Afghan family murdered.Refusing the order, Mason finds himself on the run, hunted by his former comrades and labeled a terrorist by the country he served faithfully. Relying only on his survival skills and the help of female Special Operations operative Renee Hart, Kane must embark on his gravest mission yet: unraveling the conspiracy that reaches all way to the president's inner circle and stopping the world's most dangerous soldiers from completing their treacherous plan.Set in the shadows of the war on terror, this realistic, action-packed adventure puts a twist on the traditional military thriller and starts a brand-new series that fans of Brad Thor and Brad Taylor will love.",1504633946,9781504633949),Audio CD,,,"

","Seul l'être capable d'indépendance spirituelle est digne des grandes entreprises. Tel Napoléon qui n'hésita pas à ouvrir le feu sur une foule désarmée, Raskolnikov, qui admire le grand homme, se place au-dessus du commun des mortels. Les considérations théoriques qui le poussent à tuer une vieille usurière cohabitent en s'opposant dans l'esprit du héros et constituent l'essence même du roman. Pour Raskolnikov, le crime qu'il va commettre n'est que justice envers les hommes en général et les pauvres qui se sont fait abusés en particulier. ""Nous acceptons d'être criminels pour que la terre se couvre enfin d'innocents"", écrira Albert Camus. Mais cet idéal d'humanité s'accorde mal avec la conscience de supériorité qui anime le héros, en qualité de ""surhomme"", il se situe au-delà du bien et du mal. Fomenté avec un sang-froid mêlé de mysticisme, le meurtre tourne pourtant à l'échec. Le maigre butin ne peut satisfaire son idéal de justice, tandis que le crime loin de l'élever de la masse, l'abaisse parmi les hommes. Raskolnikov finira par se rendre et accepter la condamnation, par-là même, il accèdera à la purification. Crime et Châtiment est le roman de la déchéance humaine, l'oeuvre essentielle du maître de la littérature russe.",French,French,Mass Market Paperback,,669 pages,"

","The illustrated story of a lonely alien sent to observe Earth, where he meets all sorts of creatures with all sorts of perspectives on life, love, and happiness, while learning to feel a little better about himself—based on the enormously popular Twitter account.Here is the unforgettable story of Jomny, an alien sent to study Earth. Always feeling apart, even among his species, Jomny feels at home for the first time among the earthlings he meets. There is a bear tired of other creatures running in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, a turtle hiding itself by learning camouflage, a puppy struggling to express its true feelings, and many more.The characters are unique and inventive—bees think long and hard about what love means, birds try to eat the sun, nothingness questions its own existence, a ghost comes to terms with dying, and an introverted hedgehog slowly lets Jomny see its artistic insecurities. At the same time, Jomny’s curious presence allows these characters to open up to him in ways they were never able to before, revealing the power of somebody who is just there to listen.Everyone’s a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too is also the story behind the widely-shared and typo-filled @jonnysun twitter account. Since the beginning, Sun intentionally tweeted from an outsider’s perspective, creating a truly distinct voice. Now, that outsider has taken shape in the character of Jomny, who observes Earth with the same intelligent, empathetic, and charmingly naïve voice that won over his fans on social media. New fans will find it organic, and old fans will delight at seeing the clever words that made them fans in the first place.Through this story of a lost, lonely and confused Alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the animals and plants of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all the earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we will all learn how sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are.",English,English,ebook,,256 pages,"

","Les premiers émigrants américains ont importé leurs croyances, créant ainsi des avatars des dieux du vieux continent. Aujourd'hui, les anciens Dieux saxons, figures directement issues du Wallala et passées à la postérité dans les comics, inspirant nombre de supers héros, perdent leur influence au fur et à mesure que prospèrent les nouveaux Dieux de la technologie et du consumérisme tels que les Dieux de la carte de crédit, de la télévision ou de l'automobile... Une guerre se joue entre les anciens et les nouveaux Dieux, ces derniers décidés à éliminer leurs prédécesseurs. Ombre vient de passer trois ans en prison. Libéré sur parole, il apprend que sa femme et son meilleur ami viennent de mourir dans un accident de voiture et qu'ils étaient amants. Il est contacté par un individu mystérieux, se faisant appeler Voyageur, qui l'entraîne dans une aventure mêlant mythologies et réalité, et qui se révèlera l'avatar d'Odin...Neil Gaiman explore l'âme de l'Amérique et ses représentations à travers un affrontement sans merci entre anciennes et nouvelles divinités dans un thriller épique best-seller aux USA.

He was everything – irresistibly handsome, ruthlessly elite, and seemingly untouchable - while I was nothing. Yet he protected me when I was at my lowest; more than that, he wanted me. He devoured me… and I did the same to him. Until it all fell apart and I ran as far away from Madox as I could. After all, the two of us were never meant to be together.  I never thought I’d see him again, years later. Let alone be under him in the way I’ve craved since we said goodbye.  The attraction between us still burns like fire, but time can’t change the past. And I don’t know if it’s possible for us to mend all of our broken pieces.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Kindle Edition,,156 pages,"

","For three months in the spring of 1994, the African nation of Rwanda descended into one of the most vicious and bloody genocides the world has ever seen. Immaculée Ilibagiza, a young university student, miraculously survived the savage killing spree that left most of her family, friends, and a million of her fellow citizens dead. Immaculée’s remarkable story of survival was documented in her first book, Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust.In Led By Faith, Immaculée takes us with her as her remarkable journey continues. Through her simple and eloquent voice, we experience her hardships and heartache as she struggles to survive and to find meaning and purpose in the aftermath of the holocaust. It is the story of a naïve and vulnerable young woman, orphaned and alone, navigating through a bleak and dangerously hostile world with only an abiding faith in God to guide and protect her. Immaculée fends off sinister new predators, seeks out and comforts scores of children orphaned by the genocide, and searches for love and companionship in a land where hatred still flourishes. Then, fearing again for her safety as Rwanda’s war-crime trials begin, Immaculée flees to America to begin a new chapter of her life as a refugee and immigrant—a stranger in a strange land.With the same courage and faith in God that led her through the darkness of genocide, Immaculée discovers a new life that was beyond her wildest dreams as a small girl in a tiny village in one of Africa’s poorest countries.It is in the United States, her adopted country, where Immaculée can finally look back at all that has happened to her and truly understand why God spared her life . . . so that she would be left to tell her story to the world.",1401918883,9781401918880),Paperback,,324 pages,"

But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run. The target: an unthinkably powerful artificial intelligence orbiting Earth in service of the sinister Tessier-Ashpool business clan. With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.The winner of the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K.

","The outlandish, untold story of the Irish American revolutionaries who tried to free Ireland by invading CanadaJust over a year after Robert E. Lee relinquished his sword, a band of Union and Confederate veterans dusted off their guns. But these former foes had no intention of reigniting the Civil War. Instead, they were bound by a common goal: to seize the British province of Canada and to hold it hostage until the independence of Ireland was secured.By the time that these invasions--known together as the Fenian Raids--began in 1866, Ireland had been Britain's unwilling colony for seven hundred years. Thousands of Civil War veterans considered themselves Irishmen before they were Americans. They were those who fled rather than perish in the wake of the Great Hunger, and now they took their cue from a previous generation of successful American revolutionaries. With the tacit support of the U.S. government, the Fenian Brotherhood established a state in exile, planned prison breaks, weathered infighting, stockpiled weapons, and assassinated enemies. Defiantly, this motley group, including a one-armed war hero, an English spy infiltrating rebel forces, and a radical who staged his own funeral, managed to seize a piece of Canada--if only for three days.When the Irish Invaded Canada is the untold tale of a band of fiercely patriotic Irish Americans and their chapter in Ireland's centuries-long fight for independence. Inspiring, lively, and often undeniably comic, this is a story of fighting for what's right in the face of impossible odds.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,365 pages,"

","Elie Wiesel's harrowing first-hand account of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, Night is translated by Marion Wiesel with a preface by Elie Wiesel in Penguin Modern Classics.Born into a Jewish ghetto in Hungary, as a child, Elie Wiesel was sent to the Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald. This is his account of that atrocity: the ever-increasing horrors he endured, the loss of his family and his struggle to survive in a world that stripped him of humanity, dignity and faith. Describing in simple terms the tragic murder of a people from a survivor's perspective, Night is among the most personal, intimate and poignant of all accounts of the Holocaust. A compelling consideration of the darkest side of human nature and the enduring power of hope, it remains one of the most important works of the twentieth century.Elie Wiesel (b. 1928) was fifteen years old when he and his family were deported by the Nazis to Auschwitz. After the war, Wiesel studied in Paris and later became a journalist. During an interview with the distinguished French writer, Francois Mauriac, he was persuaded to write about his experiences in the death camps. The result was his internationally acclaimed memoir, La Nuit or Night, which has since been translated into more than thirty languages.If you enjoyed Night, you might also like Primo Levi's The Periodic Table, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'A slim volume of terrifying power'The New York Times'To the best of my knowledge no one has left behind him so moving a record' Alfred Kazin'Wiesel has taken his own anguish and imaginatively metamorphosed it into art' Curt Leviant, Saturday Review",0140189890,9780140189896),Paperback,,120 pages,"

Set in 1820s Russia, Pushkin's novel in verse follows the fates of three men and three women. It was Pushkin's own favourite work, and this new translation conveys the literal sense and the poetic music of the original.Eugene Onegin is the master work of the poet whom Russians regard as the fountainhead of their literature. Set in 1820s imperial Russia, Pushkin's novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop, Lensky the minor elegiast, and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty, her sister Olga, and Pushkin's mercurial Muse. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the listener many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from a romantic poet into a realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem's spontaneity and wit.©1990, 1995 James E.

","From a rising new star of horror comes a killer read that will make you lose track of time and reality. The Crimson Labyrinth is a wicked satire on extremist reality TV in the tradition of The Running Man-if that indeed is what it is. Welcome to THE MARS LABYRINTH where things aren't what they seem. Welcome to the world of Kishi, where the plot is as gnarly as the humor is twisted.When an unemployed former math major wakes up one day, he wonders if he's somehow ended up on the red planet. The good-looking young woman with aid-she says her name is Ai and that she draws erotic comics for a living-seems to have no clue either as to their whereabouts. Their only leads are cryptic instructions beamed to a portable device. Has the game begun?There is no reset button, no saving and no continue-make the wrong move and it's really GAME OVER. In the cruel world of THE MARS LABYRINTH, mercy and compassion are only for the weak or the very, very strong. The stakes are nothing less than your life-and apparently a lot of money.If you're a fan of Lost or Battle Royale, don't miss this one.",193223411X,9781932234114),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Mickey Haller has spent all his professional life afraid that he wouldn’t recognize innocence if it stood right in front of him. But what he should have been on the watch for was evil.Haller is a Lincoln Lawyer, a criminal defense attorney who operates out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car, traveling between the far-flung courthouses of Los Angeles to defend clients of every kind. Bikers, con artists, drunk drivers, drug dealers — they’re all on Mickey Haller’s client list. For him, the law is rarely about guilt or innocence — it’s about negotiation and manipulation. Sometimes it’s even about justice.A Beverly Hills playboy arrested for attacking a woman he picked up in a bar chooses Haller to defend him, and Mickey has his first high-paying client in years. It is a defense attorney’s dream, what they call a franchise case. And as the evidence stacks up, Haller comes to believe this may be the easiest case of his career.Then someone close to him is murdered and Haller discovers that his search for innocence has brought him face-to-face with evil as pure as a flame. To escape without being burned, he must deploy every tactic, feint, and instinct in his arsenal — this time to save his own life.The Lincoln Lawyer was released as a feature film in March 2011. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller, Marisa Tomei as Maggie McPherson, and Ryan Phillippe as Louis Roulet.",B000FCKG1G,B000FCKG1G,Kindle Edition,,528 pages,"

","John Kelly, former Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran, is still getting over the accidental death of his wife six months before, when he befriends a young woman with a decidedly checkered past. When that past reaches out for her in a particularly horrifying fashion, he vows revenge and, assembling all of his old skills, sets out to track down the men responsible, before it can happen again.At the same time, the Pentagon is readying an operation to rescue a key group of prisoners in a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp. One man, they find, knows the terrain around the camp better than anyone else they have: a certain former Navy SEAL named John Kelly.Kelly has his own mission. The Pentagon wants him for theirs. Attempting to juggle the two, Kelly (now code-named Mr. Clark) finds himself confronted by a vast array of enemies, both at home and abroad - men so skillful that the slightest misstep means death. And the fate of dozens of people, including Kelly himself, rests on his making sure that misstep never happens.Men aren't born dangerous. They grow dangerous. And the most dangerous of all, Kelly learns, are the ones you least expect...As Clancy takes us through the twists and turns of Without Remorse, he blends the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, knife-edge suspense and a remarkable cast of characters.",0399138250,9780399138256),Hardcover,,639 pages,"

Or maybe not.Perpetually foiled romance heroine Island Chaptal and reformed cleaning expert March —or is it Mr. November?— are enjoying a pleasant break in South-Africa, after brushing death in the inhospitable and platypus-infested mountains of Liechtenstein... That is, until a commercial flight disintegrates over the Atlantic, killing hundreds, and Island's supervillain dad makes the news as the mastermind behind the attack. Old Lion Dries is now on the run, and he calls upon his last ally —and favorite disciple— March. From the streets of Venice to the turquoise waters of French Polynesia, March and Island embark on a deadly race against the clock to find out what secrets lie behind Dries’s downfall, and stop the mysterious “Crystal Whisperer” before it’s too late.

","Every heart longs to be seen and understood. Yet most of our lives is unwitnessed. We spend our days working, driving, parenting. We sometimes spend whole seasons feeling unnoticed and unappreciated. So how do we find contentment when we feel so hidden?In Unseen, Sara Hagerty suggests that this is exactly what God intended. He is the only One who truly knows us. He is the only One who understands the value of the unseen in our lives. When this truth seeps into our souls, we realize that only when we hide ourselves in God can we give ourselves to others in true freedom—and know the joy of a deeper relationship with the God who sees us.Our culture applauds what we can produce, what we can show, what we can upload to social media. Only when we give all of ourselves to God—unedited, abandoned, apparently wasteful in its lack of productivity—can we live out who God created us to be. As Hagerty writes, “Maybe my seemingly unproductive, looking-up-at-Him life produces awe among the angels.”Through an eloquent exploration of both personal and biblical story, Hagerty calls us to offer every unseen minute of our lives to God. God is in the secret places of our lives that no one else witnesses. But we’ve not been relegated to these places. We’ve been invited.We may be “wasting” ourselves in a hidden corner today: The cubicle on the fourth floor. The hospital bedside of an elderly parent. The laundry room. But these are the places God uses to meet us with a radical love. These are the places that produce the kind of unhinged love in us that gives everything at His feet, whether or not anyone else ever proclaims our name, whether or not anyone else ever sees.God’s invitation is not just for a season or a day. It is the question of our lives: “When no one else applauds you, when it makes no sense, when you see no results—will you waste your love on Me?”",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,240 pages,"

Don’t date your bodyguard.
It was the one rule he had to break.Maximoff Hale is a force of nature. A ship unwilling to be steered. Headstrong, resilient, and wholly responsible — the twenty-two-year-old alpha billionaire can handle his unconventional life. By noon, lunch can turn into a mob of screaming fans. By two, his face is all over the internet. Born into one of the most famous families in the country, his celebrity status began at birth. He is certified American royalty. When he’s assigned a new 24/7 bodyguard, he comes face-to-face with the worst case scenario: being attached to the tattooed, MMA-trained, Yale graduate who’s known for “going rogue” in the security team — and who fills 1/3 of Maximoff's sexual fantasies. Twenty-seven-year-old Farrow Keene has one job: protect Maximoff Hale. Flirting, dating, and hot sex falls far, far out of the boundary of his bodyguard duties and into “termination” territory. But when feelings surface, protecting the sexy-as-sin, stubborn celebrity becomes increasingly complicated. Together, boundaries blur, and being exposed could mean catastrophic consequences for both.The Like Us series is a true series, one continuous timeline, that follows a family of wealthy celebrities and the people that protect them. Damaged Like Us can be read and enjoyed without reading any of Krista & Becca's other novels.",9780997633627,9780997633627,ebook,,378 pages,"

","Winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.This riveting narrative history of the end of the arms race sheds new light on the frightening last chapters of the Cold War and the legacy of the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that remain a threat today. During the Cold War, world superpowers amassed nuclear arsenals containing the explosive power of one million Hiroshimas. The Soviet Union secretly plotted to create the “Dead Hand,” a system designed to launch an automatic retaliatory nuclear strike on the United States, and developed a fearsome biological warfare machine. President Ronald Reagan, hoping to awe the Soviets into submission, pushed hard for the creation of space-based missile defenses.In the first full account of how the arms race finally ended, The Dead Hand provides an unprecedented look at the inner motives and secret decisions of each side. Drawing on top-secret documents from deep inside the Kremlin, memoirs, and interviews in both Russia and the United States, David Hoffman introduces the scientists, soldiers, diplomats, and spies who saw the world sliding toward disaster and tells the gripping story of how Reagan, Gorbachev, and many others struggled to bring the madness to an end. When the Soviet Union dissolved, the danger continued, and the United States began a race against time to keep nuclear and biological weapons out of the hands of terrorists and and rogue states.",B002PXFYPQ,B002PXFYPQ,Kindle Edition,,595 pages,"

","Plus que le mortel ennui d'une vie répétitive, c'est une indifférence, une absence de résistance à la vie que Baricco suggère en ouvrant son roman par quelques phrases laconiques, purement énonciatives. Au début, Hervé Joncour fait penser à un spectateur repu qui se refuserait à intervenir dans la pièce qui se joue, et qui pourtant parle de lui. Voyageur en quête d'œufs de vers à soie, il se voit contraint, pour sauver les industriels de son village, d'effectuer une expédition ""jusqu'au bout du monde"". Or, en 1861, la fin du monde, c'est un Japon qui sort à peine de son isolationnisme, et, qui plus est, de mauvaise grâce. Et c'est au Japon que la vie du héros prend un tour nouveau en croisant celle d'une femme mystérieuse. À la fin du roman, plusieurs années se sont écoulées, qui ont paru un battement de cils raconté en douceur par une voix neutre qui a fait défiler sous nos yeux, tels des panneaux de papier de riz, les séquences successives de cette vie impalpable traversée par des personnages d'ombre subtile. --Sana Tang-Léopold Wauters",2070419657,9782070419654),Mass Market Paperback,Folio,142 pages,"

","The Thorn Birds is a robust, romantic saga of a singular family, the Clearys. It begins in the early part of this century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.(First Edition Jacket)",English,English,Kindle Edition,,675 pages,"

And he can’t even ask them why — not because of his Astonishing Stutter, but because asking questions is against the newly instated rules. (Rule Number Two: Don’t talk about serious things indoors, because Rule Number One: They will always be listening). As Noah—now ""Jonah Brown""—and his parents head behind the Iron Curtain into East Berlin, the rules and secrets begin to pile up so quickly that he can hardly keep track of the questions bubbling up inside him: Who, exactly, is listening — and why?

","During the last century, global domestic cat numbers rocketed past 200 million, along with a surge in cat diseases and numbers of feral cats and sick, injured and malnourished cats. Cat shelters are overflowing. Hundreds of thousands of cats are euthanised every year by despondent animal welfare workers. Misplaced sentimentality, sometimes promoted by corporate greed of cat food companies, has exacerbated this situation through promoting irresponsible feeding of strays.Ecologist and author John Read has travelled the world consulting cat experts and collating the most recent science. In Among the Pigeons he balances the allure of indoor cats with the animal welfare, human health, and conservation issues they create when allowed to roam. But he also presents solutions, from breeding ideal indoor pet cats to development of humane and targeted tools to control feral cats.In striking parallel to the repercussions of human-induced climate change, warnings about the damage wrought by free-ranging cats have been largely denied or overlooked. But we ignore these issues at our peril. For our own mental health and endangered wildlife worldwide, time is running out.Praise for Among the Pigeons'Meticulously researched, extraordinarily informative, and engagingly written.' - Dame Jane Goodall, DBE'Essential reading for all those on either side of the cat debate.' - James Valentine, ABC Sydney'Absorbing and compelling, Among the Pigeons is wonderfully written and a great read - indeed should be a required read. It will dramatically change public understanding of cats and how we should best relate to them.' - Professor Thomas E.

","Erin Blake has one of those names. A name that, like Natalee Holloway or Elizabeth Smart, is inextricably linked to a grisly crime. As a toddler, Erin survived for three days alongside the corpse of her murdered mother, and the case—which remains unsolved—fascinated a nation. Her father's identity unknown, Erin was taken in by her mother's best friend and has become a relatively normal teen in spite of the looming questions about her past.Fourteen years later, Erin is once again at the center of a brutal homicide when she finds the body of her biology teacher. When questioned by the police, Erin tells almost the whole truth, but never voices her suspicions that her mother's killer has struck again in order to protect the casework she's secretly doing on her own.Inspired by her uncle, an FBI agent, Erin has ramped up her forensic hobby into a full-blown cold-case investigation. This new murder makes her certain she's close to the truth, but when all the evidence starts to point the authorities straight to Erin, she turns to her longtime crush (and fellow suspect) Journey Michaels to help her crack the case before it's too late.",English,English,Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","On the Road AgainThere's no shortage of 20th-century literature about traveling across America in a car. Even William Least Heat-Moon, author of River Horse, wrote a nonfiction work about his search in a beat-up Ford for himself and America (Blue Highways). But not since the 19th-century adventures of Mark Twain, as told in Life on the Mississippi, have readers had the chance to vicariously take a journey across America by water rather than by road. River Horse, a voyage across America's waterways, is a return to a bygone literary tradition. Following in the footsteps of America's greatest explorers, from Henry Hudson to Lewis and Clark, Heat-Moon traveled around the waterways of America in a 22-foot cruiser boat called Nikawa (Osage for ""river horse""). Heat-Moon covers 5,000-plus miles in four months, departing from Astoria, New York, and completing his journey in Astoria, Oregon. River Horse completes Heat-Moon's trilogy of explorations of America and the American people, which he began with Blue Highways and Prairyerth.",0140298606,9780140298604),Paperback,,502 pages,"

","Spindrift usually refers to spray, particularly the spray blown from cresting waves during a gale. This spray, which ""drifts"" in the direction of the gale, is one of the characteristics of a wind speed of 8 Beaufort and higher at sea.Stories are like waves, slowly building and coming in toward the shore. In a book series, the waves build one upon the next, and for each wave there is the spindrift, the bits of story that build around those big books, but have no real place within them. These stories are the spindrift of the Exit Unicorns series.Spindrift- Caught in a fierce storm off the coast of Ireland, Brian Riordan is shipwrecked with a mysterious young man on a timeless island. Another Man's Country- Ireland of the 1920s, a time of rebellion and brother fighting against brother. Brendan Riordan, a leader in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, is at the center of the conflict and caught between the love of a woman and dedication to his country. Terence McGinty, 'the brother of his soul, if not his blood' is right there beside him, seeing the events of his war-torn country and counting the cost to them all.Grain by Grain- A glimpse of the two young Riordan boys-- a misbehaving Casey and a curious Patrick--seen through the eyes of their father, Brian.Athalia's Shoes- A pair of red shoes and a story that has been waiting to be told for three decades. This is the tale of the mysterious Russian Jew, Yevgena, and her life through a world war, through loss, love and tragedy, and the ultimate phoenix-like nature of the human soul.And as a special bonus- A sneak peek of the first chapter of book four of the Exit Unicorns series, In the Country of Shadows.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,142 pages,"

","On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold walked into Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Over the course of minutes, they would kill twelve students and a teacher and wound twenty-four others before taking their own lives.For the last sixteen years, Sue Klebold, Dylan's mother, has lived with the indescribable grief and shame of that day. How could her child, the promising young man she had loved and raised, be responsible for such horror? And how, as his mother, had she not known something was wrong? Were there subtle signs she had missed? What, if anything, could she have done differently?These are questions that Klebold has grappled with every day since the Columbine tragedy. In A Mother's Reckoning, she chronicles with unflinching honesty her journey as a mother trying to come to terms with the incomprehensible. In the hope that the insights and understanding she has gained may help other families recognize when a child is in distress, she tells her story in full, drawing upon her personal journals, the videos and writings that Dylan left behind, and on countless interviews with mental health experts.Filled with hard-won wisdom and compassion, A Mother's Reckoning is a powerful and haunting book that sheds light on one of the most pressing issues of our time. And with fresh wounds from the recent Newtown and Charleston shootings, never has the need for understanding been more urgent.
All author profits from the book will be donated to research and to charitable organizations focusing on mental health issues.

","Fangirl meets Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda in this funny and poignant coming-of-age novel from New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren about two boys who fall in love in a writing class—one from a progressive family and the other from a conservative religious community.Three years ago, Tanner Scott’s family relocated from California to Utah, a move that nudged the bisexual teen temporarily back into the closet. Now, with one semester of high school to go, and no obstacles between him and out-of-state college freedom, Tanner plans to coast through his remaining classes and clear out of Utah.But when his best friend Autumn dares him to take Provo High’s prestigious Seminar—where honor roll students diligently toil to draft a book in a semester—Tanner can’t resist going against his better judgment and having a go, if only to prove to Autumn how silly the whole thing is. Writing a book in four months sounds simple. Four months is an eternity.It turns out, Tanner is only partly right: four months is a long time. After all, it takes only one second for him to notice Sebastian Brother, the Mormon prodigy who sold his own Seminar novel the year before and who now mentors the class. And it takes less than a month for Tanner to fall completely in love with him.",1534420371,9781534420373),Paperback,,410 pages,"

","«Voyage au bout de la nuit» est un récit à la première personne dans lequel Bardamu raconte son expérience de la première guerre, du colonialisme en Afrique et de l’Amérique de l’entre-deux guerres. Bardamu a vu la Grande Guerre et l’ineptie meurtrière de ses supérieurs dans les tranchées. C’est la fin de son innocence. C’est le point de départ de sa descente sans retour. Ce long récit est une dénonciation des horreurs de la guerre mais aussi le point de départ du pessimisme qui traverse tout le récit. Bardamu part ensuite pour l’Afrique où le colonialisme est le purgatoire des Européens sans destinée. Pour Bardamu, c’est même l’Enfer et il s’enfuit vers l’Amérique de Ford, du dieu Dollar et des bordels. Bardamu n’aime pas les États-Unis, mais c’est peut-être le seul lieu où il fit la rencontre d’un être, Molly, qu’il aima jusqu’au bout de son voyage sans fond. Mais la vocation de Bardamu, ce n’est pas de travailler avec les machines des usines de Détroit, mais de côtoyer la misère humaine, quotidienne et éternelle. Il retourne donc en France pour terminer ses études en médecine et devenir médecin des pauvres. Il devient alors médecin dans la banlieue parisienne et côtoie la misère humaine tout comme en Afrique ou dans les tranchées de la Première Guerre mondiale.",None,Combine,Kindle Edition,,440 pages,"

It is important that you read each chapter intensely so you can be helped and blessed, especially the trigger points that changed my life. I was a little girl born out of wedlock to a mother who was a deaf-mute and who fell in love deserting me as her child.

","Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth -- musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies -- the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a way back into the lives of their estranged children.Now, for the first time, this astonishing novel is made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and newly added second and third appendices.The story remains unchanged, focusing on a young family that moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story -- of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.",0375410341,9780375410345),Hardcover,,736 pages,"

“A voice that was strong and cruel came from somewhere deep within me. When the voice split away and talked to me all by itself I started calling her Lo…She’d watched me at my lowest points and saved up a thousand slights, a million minor offenses. She forgave nothing, and now she wanted revenge.”

Leah is an alcoholic. She’s antisocial, self-destructive, and deeply damaged. She’s also battling a voice in her head she calls Lo, who wants to take over her body. Lo is everything Leah isn’t—beautiful, charming, confident, and ruthless in her desires.  She commandeers Leah’s will whenever Leah gets too drunk, and acts as her escort through the rainy Seattle underworld.As a misfit bibliophile, Leah’s conception of reality has never been rock solid, but as she spirals deeper into addiction the “real world” of bars, bikers, dealers, and addicts slowly dissolves into Lo’s dark vision. As Lo steadily tightens her hold, Leah prepares to make one last bid for survival, knowing her only chance is to transcend Lo’s terrifying drive toward death.An addiction memoir from Lauren Sapala, Between the Shadow and Lo is a new addition to the gritty and hilarious transgressive fiction tradition of Chuck Palahniuk, Charles Bukowski, and Joshua Mohr.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Kindle Edition,,316 pages,"

But the nameless protagonist's destiny takes an unthinkably horrifying turn when a trio of mysterious cloaked and hooded women kidnap him, chain him to the floor of a stark white room to keep as their sexual prisoner, and subjected him to eighteen days of humiliation, mutilation, and rape.

","Oliver Maria Schmitt hat mit seinen zarten vierzig schon Einiges auf dem Buckel. Titanic-Chefredakteur, Musicalschreiber, diverse Buchveröffentlichungen im Dunstkreis der Neuen Frankfurter Schule. Nachdem er „die Schnauze voll“ hatte, wie die Klappentext-Bio verkündet, besann Schmitt sich auf eine lang zurückliegende Episode seines Lebens, die wilden Jahre in seiner Heilbronner Punkband „Tiefschlag“. Da man, obgleich man inzwischen saturiert auf eine gänzlich unpunkige Erfolgsbilanz zurückblicken kann, im Herzen immer Punk geblieben ist, nennt OMS seine Spurensuche nach der fiktiven „Gruppe Senf“ und ihrer hübschen Sängerin Itty Lunatic einen „Punkroman für die besseren Kreise.“ Willkommen also im Club der wilden Dichter Jaud, Illies, Lottmann und Co. Peter Julius Hein (Schmitt himself) und Dr. Hollenbach, weder als Drummer Hollo noch als Arzt sonderlich respektabel, geraten auf eine Revival-Tour der seltsamen Art. Bodo, der Ex-Bassist, residiert inzwischen als bräsiger Immobilien-Mensch in einer Protzvilla mit Überwachungskameras in bester Stuttgarter Hanglage. Gleichermaßen verstörend wie süß, dieser menschliche Hai hätschelt und hegt in seinem Hochsicherheitstrakt Südwestdeutschlands drittgrößte Sammlung von Überraschungseiern! Immerhin weiß der Neureichen-Punk, dass Itty mit Rolfi, einem weiteren Ex-Senfkorn in der „Ostzone“ untergetaucht sei. Bad news für Peter Hein, dem die „Zone“ nach wie vor angstbesetztes Feindgebiet ist. Doch wo die Angst ist, ist der Weg! Im dauerironisierenden, zuweilen gestelzt herablassenden Tonfall geht nun ein wahres Gagfeuerwerk auf den Leser herab. Wie Ethnologen im unbekannten Dschungel treiben Hein und Hollo im thüringischen Fettnebelmeer von „Ilka’s Iss Was!?“-Wurstbude Verhaltensstudien. Kritisch vermerkt werden die „Störkraft“- und „Oithanasie“-Tattoes von Ilkas erlauchtem Kundenkreis, die jedem echten Punk bitter aufstoßen. Westliche Aufklärungsarbeit tut Not. In dem folgenden, kein Ost-Klischee auslassenden Roadmovie hagelt es Merkel-Beleidigungen, die jedem Anwalt Schweißausbrüche verursachen dürften, fliegende Rostbratwürste als Slapstick-Requisiten, sowie Rückblenden in die glorreichen Tage der „Gruppe Senf“ auf dem 7. Brackinger Backhausfeschtle, jenem magischen Ortstermin, bei dem Hein seiner Itty auf offener Bühne seine Liebe erklärte. In besinnlicheren Momenten ist Anarchoshnitzel (Senfs zeitweiliger Zweitname) ganz einfach ein sentimental journey in die Regionen früher Rebellion und verloren gegangener Träume. Ob „Gruppe Senf“ ihren zweiten Frühling erlebt, Hein Itty bekommt --, der Leser mag über die Bedeutung beider Ereignisse entscheiden. --Ravi Unger",3499243431,9783499243431),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","""I had been making the rounds of the Sacrifice Poles the day we heard my brother had escaped. I already knew something was going to happen; the Factory told me."" Those lines begin one of the most infamous of contemporary Scottish novels. The narrator, Frank Cauldhame, is a weird teenager who lives on a tiny island connected to mainland Scotland by a bridge. He maintains grisly Sacrifice Poles to serve as his early warning system & deterrent against anyone who might invade his territory. Few novelists have ever burst onto the literary scene with as much controversy as Iain Banks in 1984. The Wasp Factory was reviled by many reviewers on account of its violence & sadism, but applauded by others as a new & Scottish voice--that is, a departure from the English literary tradition. The controversy is a bit puzzling in retrospect, because there is little to object to in this novel, if you're familiar with genre horror. The Wasp Factory is distinguished by an authentically felt & deftly written first-person style, delicious dark humor, a sense of the surreal, & a serious examination of the psyche of a childhood psychopath. Most readers will find that they sympathize with & even like Frank, despite his three murders (each of which is hilarious in an Edward Gorey fashion). It's a classic of contemporary horror.--Fiona Webster",B002SPXRO6,B002SPXRO6,Audiobook,Unabridged,6 pages,"

","Bilbau, Espanha.Robert Langdon, professor de simbologia e iconologia religiosa da universidade de Harvard, chega ao ultramoderno Museu Guggenheim de Bilbau para assistir a um grandioso anúncio: a revelação da descoberta que «mudará para sempre o rosto da ciência.» O anfitrião dessa noite é Edmond Kirsch, bilionário e futurista de quarenta e dois anos cujas espantosas invenções de alta tecnologia e audazes previsões fizeram dele uma figura de renome a nível global. Kirsch, um dos primeiros alunos de Langdon em Harvard, duas décadas atrás, está prestes a revelar um incrível avanço científico… que irá responder a duas das perguntas mais fundamentais da existência humana. No início da noite, Langdon e várias centenas de outros convidados ficam fascinados com a apresentação tão original de Kirsch, e Langdon percebe que o anúncio do amigo será muito mais controverso do que ele imaginava. Mas aquela noite tão meticulosamente orquestrada não tardará a transformar-se num caos e a preciosa descoberta do futurista pode muito bem estar em vias de se perder para sempre.Em pleno turbilhão de emoções e em perigo iminente, Langdon tenta desesperadamente fugir de Bilbau. Tem ao seu lado Ambra Vidal, a elegante diretora do Guggenheim que trabalhou com Kirsch na organização daquele provocador evento. Juntos, fogem para Barcelona, com a perigosa missão de localizarem a palavra-passe que os ajudará a desvendar o segredo de Kirsch.Percorrendo os escuros corredores de história oculta e religião extremista, Langdon e Vidal têm de fugir de um inimigo atormentado que parece tudo saber e que parece até de alguma forma relacionado com o Palácio Real de Espanha… e que fará qualquer coisa para silenciar para sempre Edmond Kirsch.Numa viagem marcada pela arte moderna e por símbolos enigmáticos, Langdon e Vidal vão descobrindo as pistas que acabarão por conduzi-los à chocante descoberta de Kirsch… e a uma verdade que até então nos tem escapado e que nos deixará sem fôlego.",9722534203,9789722534208),Paperback,Large Print,552 pages,"

","A Glamour Most Anticipated Book of 2017Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Filled with emotional insight and written with Reid’s signature talent, this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",150113924X,9781501139246),ebook,,400 pages,"

","Laura Dean, the most popular girl in high school, was Frederica Riley's dream girl: charming, confident, and SO cute. There's just one problem: Laura Dean is maybe not the greatest girlfriend.Reeling from her latest break up, Freddy's best friend, Doodle, introduces her to the Seek-Her, a mysterious medium, who leaves Freddy some cryptic parting words: break up with her. But Laura Dean keeps coming back, and as their relationship spirals further out of her control, Freddy has to wonder if it's really Laura Dean that's the problem. Maybe it's Freddy, who is rapidly losing her friends, including Doodle, who needs her now more than ever. Fortunately for Freddy, there are new friends, and the insight of advice columnists like Anna Vice to help her through being a teenager in love.Mariko Tamaki and Rosemary Valero-O’Connell bring to life a sweet and spirited tale of young love that asks us to consider what happens when we ditch the toxic relationships we crave to embrace the healthy ones we need.",,9789802760015),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","From the bestselling author of The Woman on the Orient Express comes a haunting novel of two women—one determined to uncover the past and the other determined to escape it.At the close of World War II, London is in ruins and Rose Daniel isn’t at peace. Eight years ago, her brother disappeared while fighting alongside Gypsy partisans in Spain. From his letters, Rose has just two clues to his whereabouts—his descriptions of the spectacular south slopes of the Sierra Nevada and his love for a woman who was carrying his child.In Spain, it has been eight years since Lola Aragon’s family was massacred. Eight years since she rescued a newborn girl from the arms of her dying mother and ran for her life. She has always believed that nothing could make her return…until a plea for help comes from a desperate stranger.Now, Rose, Lola, and the child set out on a journey from the wild marshes of the Camargue to the dazzling peaks of Spain’s ancient mountain communities. As they come face-to-face with war’s darkest truths, their lives will be changed forever by memories, secrets, and friendships.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Audio CD,,,"

Jedna z najlepszych powieści o kontakcie z obcą cywilizacją w historii literatury fantastycznej.Uczeni przypadkiem odkrywają, że na Ziemię dociera z kosmosu sygnał, który może być komunikatem od rozumnych istot. Jednym z naukowców, którzy mają za zadanie rozkodowanie tajemniczego impulsu neutrinowego, jest sławny matematyk Piotr E. Hogarth.

","En Grèce, un petit café embué, peu avant la douceur vermeille de l'aube. Le narrateur, un jeune érudit, sirote une sauge, et attend que le passeur sonne le départ pour la Crète, où l'attend une vieille mine de lignites. Avec quelques ouvriers, il compte bien la remettre en route et surtout, selon les préceptes bouddhistes qu'il a appris, se laver de son embarrassant savoir. Soudain une bourrasque entre dans le café et dans la vie du jeune homme : c'est Alexis Zorba... qui lui offre ses services et ceux de son instrument, un santouri qui ne le quitte pas. Auprès de cet homme, il apprend plus que ce qu'il sait de ses livres. Et peu à peu, sous le soleil, il sent son être entier craquer et gonfler, mûrir comme un fruit et déverser un suc jusque-là inconnu de lui. L'oeuvre de Nikos Kazantzaki est avant tout celle d'un penseur. Il est l'auteur d'un manifeste (Ascèse, 1928), et d'une longue quête spirituelle traduite en vers dans l'Odyssée (1938). Ses romans, qui l'ont rendu célèbre, dont Alexis Zorba et Le Christ recrucifié, sont empreints de ses préoccupations métaphysiques. --Laure Anciel",2266128744,9782266128742),Mass Market Paperback,,347 pages,"

","Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts-one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow-the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks & a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate & Yeshua, & the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) & his retinue-including the vodka-drinking, black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; & a writer known only as The Master, & his passionate companion, Margarita-exist in a world that blends fantasy & chilling realism, an artful collage of grostesqueries, dark comedy & timeless ethical questions. Tho completed in 1940, The Master & Margarita wasn't published in Moscow until 1966, when the 1st part appeared in the magazine Moskva. It was an immediate & enduring success: Audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic & spiritual freedom.",English,English,Audible Audio,,,"

","Amos Decker's life changed forever--twice.The first time was on the gridiron. A big, towering athlete, he was the only person from his hometown of Burlington ever to go pro. But his career ended before it had a chance to begin. On his very first play, a violent helmet-to-helmet collision knocked him off the field for good, and left him with an improbable side effect--he can never forget anything.The second time was at home nearly two decades later. Now a police detective, Decker returned from a stakeout one evening and entered a nightmare--his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law had been murdered.His family destroyed, their killer's identity as mysterious as the motive behind the crime, and unable to forget a single detail from that horrible night, Decker finds his world collapsing around him. He leaves the police force, loses his home, and winds up on the street, taking piecemeal jobs as a private investigator when he can.But over a year later, a man turns himself in to the police and confesses to the murders. At the same time a horrific event nearly brings Burlington to its knees, and Decker is called back in to help with this investigation. Decker also seizes his chance to learn what really happened to his family that night. To uncover the stunning truth, he must use his remarkable gifts and confront the burdens that go along with them. He must endure the memories he would much rather forget. And he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice.Memory Man will stay with you long after the turn of the final page.",1455559822,9781455559824),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","In this powerful and provocative memoir, genre-bending essayist and novelist Kiese Laymon explores what the weight of a lifetime of secrets, lies, and deception does to a black body, a black family, and a nation teetering on the brink of moral collapse.Kiese Laymon is a fearless writer. In his essays, personal stories combine with piercing intellect to reflect both on the state of American society and on his experiences with abuse, which conjure conflicted feelings of shame, joy, confusion and humiliation. Laymon invites us to consider the consequences of growing up in a nation wholly obsessed with progress yet wholly disinterested in the messy work of reckoning with where we’ve been.In Heavy, Laymon writes eloquently and honestly about growing up a hard-headed black son to a complicated and brilliant black mother in Jackson, Mississippi. From his early experiences of sexual violence, to his suspension from college, to his trek to New York as a young college professor, Laymon charts his complex relationship with his mother, grandmother, anorexia, obesity, sex, writing, and ultimately gambling. By attempting to name secrets and lies he and his mother spent a lifetime avoiding, Laymon asks himself, his mother, his nation, and us to confront the terrifying possibility that few in this nation actually know how to responsibly love, and even fewer want to live under the weight of actually becoming free.A personal narrative that illuminates national failures, Heavy is defiant yet vulnerable, an insightful, often comical exploration of weight, identity, art, friendship, and family that begins with a confusing childhood—and continues through twenty-five years of haunting implosions and long reverberations.",1501125656,9781501125652),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","Nei Quattro grandi Regni del continente di Eryon impazza la guerra. Un conflitto sanguinoso, che non risparmia nemmeno i villaggi più sperduti, come Ivennon, dove Lenya Dalen vive con suo figlio Arthur e la piccola Ethel. Quando alcuni guerriglieri invadono la loro dimora, è Arthur, ancora piccolo ma con un sacro fuoco che gli arde dentro, a trarre in salvo sua madre e sua sorella grazie a una misteriosa spada lasciatagli dal defunto padre. Anni dopo, con la pace nel frattempo sopraggiunta, Arthur sarà impegnato a dover trovare il suo posto nel mondo, e le sue avventure si intrecceranno a quelle di maghi, divinatrici, banditi e spadaccine.L'eredità della spada è un romanzo articolato, scritto con una prosa che fa del dettaglio e della cura descrittiva la sua peculiarità più visibile. Una storia che narra di un mondo d'altri tempi ma raccontando sentimenti, emozioni e umanità che non hanno età. Al confine tra il fantasy e l'opera di ambientazione storica, è un libro per chi ha voglia di immergersi completamente in un'avventura davvero avvincente.Dunque, il rito prevedeva che uno dei due piatti si muovesse... il fatto che niente di tutto ciò fosse avvenuto era la dimostrazione che Arthur possedeva la libertà di decidere del proprio destino; ma, anche messo di fronte a possibilità infinite, il desiderio del giovane non era che uno.“Io voglio che le cose cambino.”",English,English,Kindle Edition,,650 pages,"

","ADVENTURE. DANGER. ROMANCE. A CAST OF CHARACTERS YOU WILL ROOT FOR.  Set includes all four books in the popular series that reached #1 in teen paranormal reads and Greek mythology.  Seventeen year old Kris Young is on the run from a throng of superhuman, golden-eyed freaks hell-bent on seeing her dead, and she doesn't know why. Good thing she has her guardian angel to protect her...sort of.  Kris is aided by Nathan, the mysterious man that ends up being anything but angelic when he rescues her for the fourth time in fourteen years. Even if the handsome hero illusion is shattered by his harsh treatment of her, he knows how to fight this strange enemy and is determined to keep her safe at all costs.  As the body count rises in their wake, Nathan introduces Kris to a world in which not everyone is human and the battle lines between good and evil are clearly drawn. Kris's piece in the puzzle is something neither is aware of and, as they uncover the truth, neither is prepared for what they find. Overcoming twists and revelations that shatter both of their lives, they discover that nothing is as it seems and nothing, least of all their hearts, are safe.  Experience The Ignited Series, and read an enthralling tale of first love, friendship, heartbreak, mystery and adventure that will introduce you to an exciting new world as Kris discovers how she fits in it.",None,Combine,Kindle Edition,,1229 pages,"

They stand out as one of the pinnacles in the critically neglected but perennially popular tradition of weird writing that includes E.T.A. Hoffmann and Charles Dickens as well as more recent masters like Jorge Luis Borges and Roald Dahl. With a cast of characters that ranges from man-eating flora to disgruntled devils and suburban salarymen (not that it's always easy to tell one from another), Collier's dazzling stories explore the implacable logic of lunacy, revealing a surreal landscape whose unstable surface is depth-charged with surprise.",1590170512,9781590170519),Paperback,,418 pages,"

","Mike DeCapite's Through the Windshield is a journey to the end of the night in a '74 LeSabre. What began in 1985 as a single page of notes for a book about a year in the life of a down-and-out cab driver became, five years later, this tour de force novel, full of characters, weather, talk, illuminations, laughter—full of life.

","Here, for the first time, is a volume that gathers the published verse of Allen Ginsberg in its entirety, a half century of brilliant work from one of America's great poets. The chief figure among the Beats, Ginsberg changed the course of American poetry, liberating it from closed academic forms with the creation of open, vocal, spontaneous, and energetic postmodern verse in the tradition of Walt Whitman, Guillaume Apollinaire, Hart Crane, Ezra Pound, and William Carlos Williams. Ginsberg's classics Howl, Reality Sandwiches, Kaddish, Planet News, and The Fall of America led American (and international) poetry toward uncensored vernacular, explicit candor, the ecstatic, the rhapsodic, and the sincere—all leavened by an attractive and pervasive streak of common sense. Ginsberg's raw tones and attitudes of spiritual liberation also helped catalyze a psychological revolution that has become a permanent part of our cultural heritage, profoundly influencing not only poetry and popular song and speech, but also our view of the world.The uninterrupted energy of Ginsberg's remarkable career is clearly revealed in this collection. Seen in order of composition, the poems reflect on one another; they are not only works but also a work. Included here are all the poems from the earlier volume Collected Poems 1947-1980, and from Ginsberg's subsequent and final three books of new poetry: White Shroud, Cosmopolitan Greetings, and Death & Fame. Enriching this book are illustrations by Ginsberg's artist friends; unusual and illuminating notes to the poems, inimitably prepared by the poet himself; extensive indexes; as well as prefaces and various other materials that accompanied the original publications.",0061139742,9780061139741),Hardcover,First Edition,1216 pages,"

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewIn the classical world, the muses -- all nine of them -- were daughters of Zeus who inspired poets, musicians, and other creative types to produce works of genius. Today, says Francine Prose, the word has been weakened and is used almost exclusively to refer to the chic women who help fashion designers inform their latest lines. But in her scholarly account, Prose (a National Book Award finalist for her novel 
Blue Angel
) presents nine real women who moved men to greatness and who were not mere catalysts but worthy of note on their own, in many cases deserving a share of the credit for the work they helped create.Each chapter is a mini-biography of a woman's life and the way a male artist figured into it. We see the muse as prompter and creator in her own regard, like memoirist Hester Thrale, whose letters to Samuel Johnson helped form his later works. In Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the muse is at her most passive, asserting her independence of the child-loving author only by failing to remain seven years old forever. And with Yoko Ono, there is the muse as artist in her own right, who claimed not to have heard of the Beatles before meeting John Lennon, and whose avant-garde tendencies some blamed for his musical downfall.To hit the mystical nine, Prose stretches a bit. For every Suzanne Farrell collaborating on ballets with George Balanchine, or every Gala Dal� cosigning canvases with spouse Salvador, there are personae only a graduate student would be likely to know. We learn of ""serial muse"" Lou Andreas-Salom�'s involvement with Friedrich Nietzsche, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Sigmund Freud, and of how Charis Weston had to vie with a toilet for the attentions of her photographer husband, Edward. But these lesser-knowns help make the book a complete analysis of notable women who motivated men of achievement -- usually at the expense of their own -- and lived with the consequences. iKatherine Hottinger/i",0060555254,9780060555252),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","In this heartrending and inspiring novel set against the gorgeous, vast landscape of South Africa under apartheid, award-winning playwright Pamela Gien tells the story of two families–one black, one white–separated by racism, connected by love. Even at the age of six, lively, inquisitive Elizabeth Grace senses she’s a child of privilege, “a lucky fish.” Soothing her worries by raiding the sugar box, she scampers up into the sheltering arms of the lilac-blooming syringa tree growing behind the family’ s suburban Johannesburg home.Lizzie’s closest ally and greatest love is her Xhosa nanny, Salamina. Deeper and more elemental than any traditional friendship, their fierce devotion to each other is charged and complicated by Lizzie’s mother, who suffers from creeping melancholy, by the stresses of her father’s medical practice, which is segregated by law, and by the violence, injustice, and intoxicating beauty of their country. In the social and racial upheavals of the 1960s, Lizzie’s eyes open to the terror and inhumanity that paralyze all the nation’s cultures–Xhosa, Zulu, Jew, English, Boer. Pass laws requiring blacks to carry permission papers for white areas and stringent curfews have briefly created an orderly state–but an anxious one. Yet Lizzie’s home harbors its own set of rules, with hushed midnight gatherings, clandestine transactions, and the girl’s special task of protecting Salamina’s newborn child–a secret that, because of the new rules, must never be mentioned outside the walls of the house.As the months pass, the contagious spirit of change sends those once underground into the streets to challenge the ruling authority. And when this unrest reaches a social and personal climax, the unthinkable will happen and forever change Lizzie’s view of the world. When The Syringa Tree opened off-Broadway in 2001, theater critics and audiences alike embraced the play, and it won many awards. Pamela Gien has superbly deepened the story in this new novel, giving a personal voice to the horrors and hopes of her homeland. Written with lyricism, passion, and life-affirming redemption, this compelling story shows the healing of the heart of a young woman and the soul of a sundered nation.",0375507558,9780375507557),Hardcover,,262 pages,"

","Mycelium Running is a manual for the mycological rescue of the planet. That’s right: growing more mushrooms may be the best thing we can do to save the environment, and in this groundbreaking text from mushroom expert Paul Stamets, you’ll find out how. The basic science goes like this: Microscopic cells called “mycelium”--the fruit of which are mushrooms--recycle carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements as they break down plant and animal debris in the creation of rich new soil. What Stamets has discovered is that we can capitalize on mycelium’s digestive power and target it to decompose toxic wastes and pollutants (mycoremediation), catch and reduce silt from streambeds and pathogens from agricultural watersheds (mycofiltration), control insect populations (mycopesticides), and generally enhance the health of our forests and gardens (mycoforestry and myco-gardening).  In this comprehensive guide, you’ll find chapters detailing each of these four exciting branches of what Stamets has coined “mycorestoration,” as well as chapters on the medicinal and nutritional properties of mushrooms, inoculation methods, log and stump culture, and species selection for various environmental purposes. Heavily referenced and beautifully illustrated, this book is destined to be a classic reference for bemushroomed generations to come.",1580085792,9781580085793),Paperback,,356 pages,"

A LONG-OUT-OF-PRINT CLASIC BY A MASTER OF UNDERGROUND COMICS
In the late 1980s, the idiosyncratic Chester Brown (author of the muchlauded Paying for It and Louis Riel) began writing the cult classic comic book series Yummy Fur. Within its pages, he serialized the groundbreaking Ed the Happy Clown, revealing a macabre universe of parallel dimensions. Thanks to its wholly original yet disturbing story lines, Ed set the stage for Brown to become a world-renowned cartoonist. Ed the Happy Clown is a hallucinatory tale that functions simultaneously as a dark roller-coaster ride of criminal activity and a scathing condemnation of religious and political charlatanism. As the world around him devolves into madness, the eponymous Ed escapes variously from a jealous boyfriend, sewer monsters, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a janitor with a Jesus complex. Brown leaves us wondering, with every twist of the plot, just how Ed will get out of this scrape. The intimate, tangled world of Ed the Happy Clown is definitively presented here, repackaged with a new foreword by the author and an extensive notes section, and is, like every Brown book, astonishingly perceptive about the zeitgeist of its time.

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Nelson DeMille comes a suspenseful new novel featuring Detective John Corey and an all-too-plausible conspiracy to detonate a nuclear bomb in two major American cities.
Welcome to the Custer Hill Club--an informal men's club set in a luxurious Adirondack hunting lodge whose members include some of America's most powerful business leaders, military men, and government officials. Ostensibly, the club is a place to gather with old friends, hunt, eat, drink, and talk off-the-record about war, life, death, sex and politics. But one Fall weekend, the Executive Board of the Custer Hill Club gathers to talk about the tragedy of 9/11 and what America must do to retaliate. Their plan is finalized and set into motion. That same weekend, a member of the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force is reported missing. His body is soon discovered in the woods near the Custer Hill Club's game reserve. The death appears to be a hunting accident, and that's how the local police first report it, but Detective John Corey has his doubts. As he digs deeper, he begins to unravel a plot involving the Custer Hill Club, a top-secret plan known only by its code name: Wild Fire. 
Racing against the clock, Detective Corey and his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, find they are the only people in a position to stop the button from being pushed and chaos from being unleashed.

The protagonist, a moody twenty-something wallowing in depression after a breakup with his long-time girlfriend, finds himself drawn into a paranoid's worst nightmare after his best friend is murdered and the blame is pinned on him. With the help of a single mother who spontaneously throws in her lot with him (not to mention her precocious daughter), he sets out to clear his name. Soon new relationships are forged, dark secrets from the past are revealed, and the real killer comes back into the picture... with a vengeance.",1560976551,9781560976554),Paperback,,48 pages,"

","When a war-ending blast incinerates Haley Cork's father half a world away, she becomes the only one who can get justice for the billions of dead, and must use the powers of the mysterious Blue Door to find and imprison those responsible. Most of the world's fighting men are gone and their widows left behind as prey to corrupt noblemen. The Blue Door called Haley to do more than avenge their deaths -- it selected her to become the latest member of a race of immortals called Keepers. Her dark red hair and amber eyes set her apart from her own community, but the Door intends to take away her humanity as it pursues its own hidden agenda. Every answer leads to more questions: Who detonated the bomb? What exactly is the Blue Door? Why must Haley combat an Enemy who devours entire worlds? Who are these mysterious Keepers? Most girls are ill equipped to investigate the mystery behind the terrible bombing. Not many girls are like Haley Cork, who changes on her path to destiny.",144047513X,9781440475139),Paperback,,314 pages,"

","DIVDIVDaniel barely remembers leading a normal life before the Nazis came to power in 1933. He can still picture once being happy and safe, but memories of those days are fading as he and his family face the dangers threatening Jews in Hitler's Germany in the late 1930's. No longer able to practice their religion, vote, own property, or even work, Daniel's family is forced from their home in Frankfurt and sent on a long and dangerous journey, first to the Lodz ghetto in Poland, and then to Auschwitz -, the Nazi death camp. Though many around him lose hope in the face of such terror, Daniel, supported by his courageous family, struggles for survival. He finds hope, life and even love in the midst of despair./DIV/DIV",0590465880,9780590465885),Paperback,,144 pages,"
