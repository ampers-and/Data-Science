","A guide to nourishing the body through bone marrow rejuvenation exercises • Presents exercises to “regrow” bone marrow, revive the internal organs, and prevent osteoporosis • Explains the use of bone breathing and bone compression, “hitting” to detoxify the body, and sexual energy massage and chi weight lifting to enhance the life force within Most Westerners believe that a daily physical exercise program helps slow the aging process. Yet those whose bodies appear most physically fit on the outside often enjoy only the same life span as the average nonathletic person. It is the internal organs and glands that nourish every function of the body, and it is the bone marrow that nourishes and rejuvenates the organs and glands through the production of blood. By focusing only on the muscles without cultivating the internal organs, bones, and blood, the Western fitness regimen can ultimately exhaust the internal system. In Bone Marrow Nei Kung Master Mantak Chia reveals the ancient mental and physical Taoist techniques used to “regrow” bone marrow, strengthen the bones, and rejuvenate the organs and glands. An advanced practice of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, Bone Marrow Nei Kung was developed as a way to attain the “steel body” coveted in the fields of Chinese medicine and martial arts. This method of absorbing energy into the bones revives the bone marrow and reverses the effects of aging through the techniques of bone breathing, bone compression, and sexual energy massage, which stimulates the hormonal production that helps prevent osteoporosis.

","Perhaps now best known as an acclaimed (and bestselling) author of fiction, Joe Klein has for nearly three decades been one of contemporary journalism's premiere reporters. In ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"", Klein's signature style of insightful narrative nonfiction brings to life a vivid chapter in the history of American culture.In 1998, the Woody Guthrie Foundation made public for the first time more than 10,000 of his papers, letters, song lyrics, and artworks, sparking renewed interest in the life of an American folk legend who influenced generations of musicians to come. The New York Times, reporting on the phenomenon, described Guthrie's appeal and legacy succinctly: ""(Woody Guthrie was) one of the most influential cultural figures of the century. Guthrie inspired Bob Dylan and virtually created the modern folk tradition and singer-songwriter genre, and his music remains as vital today as when he was performing"".Born in Oklahoma in 1912, Guthrie spent his early years among the farmers and migrant workers of the dust bowl. As a young man during the Great Depression, he traveled across the country by boxcar with his guitar, composing the indelible folk ballads that made him a leader of the politically vital folk movement of the pre-war era. Tragically, the onset of Huntington's disease, gradually diminished his mind, body, and work, and led to his untimely death at the age of 55. Still, Guthrie's life and music have inspired every important folk and folk rock artist since, from Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez to Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Ani DiFranco.",Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Chronicling some from the point of view of one of the twentieth century's most influential musicians, Woody Guthrie's Bound for Glory includes an introduction by Joe Klein, author of Primary Colors, in Penguin Modern Classics.'Now I been here an' I been there,Rambled aroun' most everywhere'Bound for Glory is the funny, cynical and earthy autobiography of Woody Guthrie, the father of modern American folk music. He tells of his childhood running wild in an Oklahoma oil-boom town, the tragedies that struck his family and of life on the open road during the Great Depression - hell-raising and brawling in boxcars, all while singing to raise a dime for his next meal. But above all, this is a song for the America that Woody saw from his lonesome highway, as he travelled from one end of the country to the other with guitar in hand and the songs that made him a legend drifting out over the Dust Bowl. Adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring David Carradine, Bound for Glory is the moving true story of America's greatest folksinger.Woody Guthrie (1912-67), the son of a cowboy, was born in rural Oklahoma. When the Depression arrived, Woody hit the road and travelled round America. He became a folksinger, guitarist, actor, artist and broadcaster, and is best remembered for songs including 'This Land is Your Land', 'Roll On, Columbia, Roll On' and 'Worried Man Blues'.If you enjoyed Bound for Glory, you might like Jack Kerouac's On the Road, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'Wild as a train whistle in the mountains, a scrumptious picture of fighting, carousing, singing, laughing migratory across America'The New York Times'One of the patron saints of American rebelliousness'Joe Klein'Even readers who never heard Woody or his songs will understand the current esteem in which he's held after reading just a few pages . . . always shockingly immediate and real, as if Woody was telling it out loud . . .

","Songwriter, poet, writer, political activist . . . and, perhaps most fundamental to his work but least known about Woody Guthrie, artist. ""Contrary to popular mythology, it was with paint brushes in hand, not a guitar, that Guthrie hit the road for California. He had hocked his guitar . . . and it was his artistic skills that he brokered for room and board."" So begins Nora's fascinating revelations about her father's vast body of artwork. Other than the drawings for his autobiography, Bound for Glory, few have seen Guthrie's art. This is because much of it is inextricably bound into diaries and work books into which he poured his images, and which are presented here for the first time. Guthrie worked as a commercial artist, illustrating album covers, books, and newspaper columns, and kept a daily record of his life, and of American life, in thousands of pictures. Some complement song-writing in such a fluid way that they often appear interwoven with handwritten lyrics. The stinging honesty, humor, and wit found in his music are also to be found in his art, layering our understanding of his social, political, and spiritual life. In more than 300 examples, his visual creativity is apparent, from political cartoons to bawdy and comical gouaches to children's art to abstract emotional outpourings. Drawing extensively on Guthrie's words, Brower unveils an enhanced portrait of one of America's greatest creative forces.",Hardcover,,344 pages,"

","Woody Guthrie spent his life putting into words and music what the rest of America was thinking. He roamed from coast to coast and captured the despair of those displaced by the Great Depression and the dust bowl, eulogized workers, and celebrated the great natural beauty of America. This is an introductory biography presented as a picture book with a brief lyrical text and powerful, hand-tinted, woodcut-like illustrations. It includes the complete lyrics to “This Land Is Your Land” and excerpts from his other songs. A book for all ages, it makes this talented and tragic man accessible to young children and will please his older folksinging fans with its stunning art.",Hardcover,,32 pages,"

","""Noe says, -I must build a boat.-A boat, she says.-A ship, more like. I'll need the boys to help, he adds as an afterthought.-We're leagues from the sea, she says, or any river big enough to warrant a boat.This conversation is making Noe impatient. -I've no need to explain myself to you.-And when you're done, she says carefully, we'll be taking this ship to the sea somehow?As usual, Noe's impatience fades quickly. -We'll not be going to the sea. The sea will be coming to us.""In this brilliant debut novel, Noah's family (or Noe as he's called here)-his wife, sons, and daughters-in-law-tell what it's like to live with a man touched by God, while struggling against events that cannot be controlled or explained. When Noe orders his sons to build an ark, he can't tell them where the wood will come from. When he sends his daughters-in-law out to gather animals, he can offer no directions, money, or protection. And once the rain starts, they all realize that the true test of their faith is just beginning. Because the family is trapped on the ark with thousands of animals-with no experience feeding or caring for them, and no idea of when the waters will recede. What emerges is a family caught in the midst of an extraordinary Biblical event, with all the tension, humanity-even humor-that implies.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The extraordinarily talented Frank Applegate died prematurely at his Santa Fe home in 1931. Well-known in his day as an artist, collector, craft revivalist, and author, he is now largely forgotten. This splendid, readable biography should help make his name familiar once more. I give it an enthusiastic recommendation. The contemporary Hispanic artists of New Mexico -- especially the modern-day santeros -- owe a great deal to the visionary artist Frank Applegate. He helped to set the stage for the modern world to appreciate, collect, and love the religious art of my people. Carefully researched and elegantly written, this volume provides a well-rounded portrait of Frank Applegate, an artist who made significant contributions to the culture of Santa Fe in the 1920s. In telling Applegate's story, the authors provide a fascinating view of life in Santa Fe during that time. This book is lavishly illustrated with old photographs and pictures of Applegate's art work.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

","How management can effectively rid themselves of 'monkeys' -- other people's responsibilities that cling to them and prevent them managing efficiently. This book explains in simple-minded if abstract terms how to achieve a balance between supervision and delegation for reduced tension and improved productivity in the work-place. There is a high correlation between self-reliance and morale, stress the authors. With humor and logic they describe the delicate business of assigning monkeys to the right masters and keeping them healthy, i. e. , fed and cared for: . . . if monkeys are managed properly, you don't have to manage people so much.

","""Perfect for all of us who can never get enough time with good books. It not only urges us to indulge deeply and often, it shows us how.""-Myra Hart, professor, Harvard Business School ""Readers and want-to-be readers will be encouraged by the advice to read more, more widely and more systematically.""-Michael Keller, university librarian, Stanford University ""An ideal gift for both sporadic and relentless readers.""-James Mustich Jr., publisher of A Common Reader ""A worthy addition to even the most well-stocked personal library.""-Ross King, author of Michelangelo & The Pope's Ceiling 
Do not set out to live a well-read life but rather your well-read life. No one can be well-read using someone else's reading list. Unless a book is good for you, you won't connect with it and gain from it. Just as no one can tell you how to lead your life, no one can tell you what to read for your life.
 How do readers find more time to read? In The Little Guide to Your Well-Read Life, Steve Leveen offers both inspiration and practical advice for bibliophiles on how to get more books in their life and more life from their books. His recommendations are disarmingly refreshing, as when he advises when not to read a book and why not to feel guilty if you missed reading all those classics in school. He helps readers reorganize their bookshelves into a Library of Candidates that they actively build and a Living Library of books read with enthusiasm, and he emphasizes the value of creating a Bookography, or annotated list of your reading life. Separate chapters are devoted to the power of audio books and the merits of reading groups. The author himself admits he came ""late to the bookshelf,"" making this charming little guide all the more convincing.",Hardcover,,132 pages,"

","This is an introduction to the teaching of English. Its emphasis is on practical issues and it is appropriate for self-study and for use with classes of trainee teachers. The early chapters address such issues as How can we be good teachers?, What makes a good learner? and how can teachers make classes better?. The book suggests a way of looking at a variety of teaching methods according to a single model of teaching and goes on to offer a concise theoretical guide to the description of language. Subsequent chapters look at specific teaching methods, particularly in relation to the four skills, as well as offering ideas on textbook use, lesson planning and coping with the unexpected. For each chapter a range of tasks is provided to stimulate debate and further thought.",Paperback,,198 pages,"

","In Consciousness Explained, Daniel C. Dennett reveals the secrets of one of the last remaining mysteries of the universe: the human brain.Daniel C. Dennett's now-classic book blends philosophy, psychology and neuroscience - with the aid of numerous examples and thought-experiments - to explore how consciousness has evolved, and how a modern understanding of the human mind is radically different from conventional explanations of consciousness.What people think of as the stream of consciousness is not a single, unified sequence, the author argues, but 'multiple drafts' of reality composed by a computer-like 'virtual machine'.Dennett explains how science has exploded the classic mysteries of consciousness: the nature of introspection, the self or ego and its relation to thoughts and sensations, the problems posed by qualia, and the level of consciousness of non-human creatures.'Brilliant ... a torrent of stimulating thought'  Richard Dawkins'Revolutionary ... one of the most mentally agile, intellectually resourceful books you are likely to read'   Guardian'A masterful tapestry of deep insights ...

","Daniel C. Dennett's Freedom Evolves tackles the most important question of human existence - is there really such a thing as free will?How can humans make genuinely independent choices if we are just a cluster of cells and genes in a world determined by scientific laws?Here, Daniel Dennett provides an impassioned defense of free will. But rather than freedom being an eternal, unchanging condition of our existence, in reality, he reveals, it has evolved: just like life on the planet and the air we breathe. Evolution is the key to resolving this greatest of philosophical questions - and to understanding our place in the world as uniquely free agents.Dennett shows that far from there being an incompatibility between contemporary science and the traditional vision of freedom and morality, it is only recently that science has advanced to the point where we can see how we came to have our unique kind of freedom.'A serious book with a brilliant message'  Matt Ridley, author of The Red Queen'Powerful and ingenious ...

","In Neuroscience and Philosophy three prominent philosophers and a leading neuroscientist clash over the conceptual presuppositions of cognitive neuroscience. The book begins with an excerpt from Maxwell Bennett and Peter Hacker's Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience (Blackwell, 2003), which questions the conceptual commitments of cognitive neuroscientists. Their position is then criticized by Daniel Dennett and John Searle, two philosophers who have written extensively on the subject, and Bennett and Hacker in turn respond.Their impassioned debate encompasses a wide range of central themes: the nature of consciousness, the bearer and location of psychological attributes, the intelligibility of so-called brain maps and representations, the notion of qualia, the coherence of the notion of an intentional stance, and the relationships between mind, brain, and body. Clearly argued and thoroughly engaging, the authors present fundamentally different conceptions of philosophical method, cognitive-neuroscientific explanation, and human nature, and their exchange will appeal to anyone interested in the relation of mind to brain, of psychology to neuroscience, of causal to rational explanation, and of consciousness to self-consciousness.In his conclusion Daniel Robinson (member of the philosophy faculty at Oxford University and Distinguished Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University) explains why this confrontation is so crucial to the understanding of neuroscientific research. The project of cognitive neuroscience, he asserts, depends on the incorporation of human nature into the framework of science itself. In Robinson's estimation, Dennett and Searle fail to support this undertaking; Bennett and Hacker suggest that the project itself might be based on a conceptual mistake. Exciting and challenging, Neuroscience and Philosophy is an exceptional introduction to the philosophical problems raised by cognitive neuroscience.",Hardcover,,215 pages,"

One of the foremost workers in this multidisciplinary field is Daniel Dennett. This book brings together his essays on the philosphy of mind, artificial intelligence, and cognitive ethology that appeared in inaccessible journals from 1984 to 1996. Highlights include ""Can Machines Think?, "" ""The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, "" ""Artificial Life as Philosophy, "" and ""Animal Consciousness: What Matters and Why.""

","From the author of Blessings and Still Life with Bread Crumbs, Anna Quindlen’s classic reflection on a meaningful life is the perfect gift for graduation, or any occasion.“Life is made of moments, small pieces of silver amidst long stretches of tedium. It would be wonderful if they came to us unsummoned, but particularly in lives as busy as the ones most of us lead now, that won’t happen. We have to teach ourselves now to live, really live . . . to love the journey, not the destination.” In this treasure of a book, Anna Quindlen, the bestselling novelist and columnist, reflects on what it takes to “get a life”—to live deeply every day and from your own unique self, rather than merely to exist through your days. “Knowledge of our own mortality is the greatest gift God ever gives us,” Quindlen writes, “because unless you know the clock is ticking, it is so easy to waste our days, our lives.” Her mother died when Quindlen was nineteen: “It was the dividing line between seeing the world in black and white, and in Technicolor. The lights came on for the darkest possible reason. . . . I learned something enduring, in a very short period of time, about life. And that was that it was glorious, and that you had no business taking it for granted.” But how to live from that perspective, to fully engage in our days? In A Short Guide to a Happy Life, Quindlen guides us with an understanding that comes from knowing how to see the view, the richness in living.",Hardcover,,50 pages,"

","""All you can usually say about a poem or a picture is, 'Look at it, listen to it.' Whether you listen to a piece of music or a poem, or look at a picture or a jug or a piece of sculpture, what matters about it is not what it has in common with others of its kind, but what is singularly its own.""—Basil BuntingA close poetic ally of Ezra Pound and Louis Zukofsky, the British poet Basil Bunting is best known for his use of specific musical form in poetry. Several of his works, including his long poem Briggflatts, are in the form of the sonata. Although his language is plain, unvarnished English, his influences and models extend to Classical, Persian, and Japanese verse.Basil Bunting on Poetry collects two series of lectures that Bunting delivered in 1968 and 1974. Tracing the development of an English poetry governed by families of stress-groups from Beowulf down to Wyatt, Wordsworth, Whitman, Pound, and Zukofsky, the lectures focus on writing and hearing poetry rather than on literary-historical concerns. Throughout, editor Peter Makin expands upon and annotates the lectures with additional comments drawn from Bunting's writings.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","After a consideration of the best lyric poetry of the Second World War the writer examines those poems which responded more fully to the challenge of the war. These are the long poems of Eliot, Pound, Bunting and MacDiarmid. Through a close reading of the poems the writer demonstrates that what these radically different poets have in common in their war poems is their use of modernist techniques to transcend the particulars of the war and to assert the resilience of the human spirit and civilisation when confronted with such an unprecedented threat.",Hardcover,,135 pages,"

","On Side 1 is a rare interview, recorded in 1964, with J. R. R. Tolkien and Denis Gueroult about his imaginary world of ""Middle Earth"" and the languages he created for his characters in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Inventing languages was one of his childhood pastimes, while in his academic life at Oxford he was Professor of Anglo-Saxon and later of English Language and Literature. Tolkien's personality and his views on man, society and politics come across clearly in this illuminating conversation. Side 2 of the cassette contains an interview with Basil Bunting and Eric Mottram, in which Bunting recalls his early days, particularly his association with Ezra Pound and Louis Zokofsky. Bunting describes his role in the revival of public poetry readings, and how he persuaded Pound to change his method of delivery, and he discusses the work of several poets and assesses the state of British poetry.",Audio Cassette,,0 pages,"

","About Steamboat Slough There was something under the ice at Steamboat Slough, something lost, buried in the frozen wreckage where the children feared to play. For Daniel Edwards, returning to the old mission site near the Yukon where he taught school a decade past, the wreck of an old steamboat becomes more than a tale told by the village elders. In a mystery weaving the shifting imagery of a dream with modern psychology and ancient myth, Daniel struggles to solve the riddle of the old wreck and free himself from the haunting embrace of a nightmare older than history itself. Based on a real story, time, and place where the author once served as a volunteer teacher in an Eskimo village, Steamboat Slough has a universal almost archetypal quality about it, a strange alchemy of science, soul and mythology.",Paperback,,316 pages,"

","Marianne North was a Victorian figure of some consequence. An amateur botanist and painter, she journeyed to the world's farthest reaches, to its ancient and new civilizations. She also wrote one of the major travel accounts of the Victorian period. Written after she retired from travel because of ill health, Recollections of a Happy Life incorporates journals and letters from throughout her travelling years. The huge manuscript left at her death was reduced and edited by her sister and published in 1892 in three volumes. Volume 1 is reprinted here. In a new Introduction, Susan Morgan raises issues of gender, imperialism, and the Victorian approach to science.",Paperback,,374 pages,"

","On May 2, 1973, Black Panther Assata Shakur (aka JoAnne Chesimard) lay in a hospital, close to death, handcuffed to her bed, while local, state, and federal police attempted to question her about the shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike that had claimed the life of a white state trooper. Long a target of J. Edgar Hoover's campaign to defame, infiltrate, and criminalize Black nationalist organizations and their leaders, Shakur was incarcerated for four years prior to her conviction on flimsy evidence in 1977 as an accomplice to murder.This intensely personal and political autobiography belies the fearsome image of JoAnne Chesimard long projected by the media and the state. With wit and candor, Assata Shakur recounts the experiences that led her to a life of activism and portrays the strengths, weaknesses, and eventual demise of Black and White revolutionary groups at the hand of government officials. The result is a signal contribution to the literature about growing up Black in America that has already taken its place alongside The Autobiography of Malcolm X and the works of Maya Angelou.Two years after her conviction, Assata Shakur escaped from prison. She was given political asylum by Cuba, where she now resides.",Paperback,,274 pages,"

","An essential document of the Black Panther Party written by three leading thinkers and party activists who were jailed following the FBI'S 1969 mandate to destroy the organization ""by any means possible.""Still Black, Still Strong is partly based upon the 1989 videotape Framing The Panthers by producers Chris Bratton and Annie Goldson. It recounts the stories of Dhoruba Bin Wahad, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur, all of whom were arrested and jailed during the COINTELPRO probe of the Black Panther Party.Dhoruba Bin Wahad, who organized chapters of the Black Panther Party in New York and along the Estern Seaboard and worked with tenants in Harlem and on drug rehabilitation in the Bronx, was accused of murdering two officers while still in his teens and imprisoned for 19 years. He always maintained his innocence and won his freedom by forcing the FBI to release thousands of classified documents proving that he had been framed. The justice department eventually rescinded Bin Wahad's conviction and he was released in 1990, seven months after the documentary premiered.Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who headed the Black Panther free breakfast program for inner-city school children in Philadelphia, was also accused of the murder of an officer and sent on death-row, where he still is today.Assata Shakur was a college educated social worker in her twenties when she was accused of shooting a cop, then arrested and tortured and denied medical treatment. Her interview was conducted in Cuba where she has been exiled since her escape from a New Jersey women's prison in 1975.Bin Wahad, Shakur and Abu-Jamal offer a little-known history and an incisive analysis of the Black Panthers' original goals, which the U.S. Government has tried to distort and suppress. As one confidential, 1969, memo to J. Edgar Hoover put it, ""The Negro youth and moderates must be made to understand that if they succumb to revolutionary teaching, they will be dead revolutionaries.""",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","In The Well of Stars, Hugo award-nominated author Robert Reed has written a stunning sequel to his acclaimed novel Marrow. The Great Ship, so vast that it contains within its depths a planet that lay undiscovered for generations, has cruised through the universe for untold billions of years. After a disastrous exploration of the planet, Marrow, the Ship's captains face an increasingly restive population aboard their mammoth vessel.  And now, compounding the captains' troubles, the Ship is heading on an irreversible course straight for the Ink Well, a dark, opaque nebula. Washen and Pamir, the captains who saved Marrow from utter destruction, send Mere, whose uncanny ability to adapt to and understand other cultures makes her the only one for the job, to investigate the nebula before they plunge blindly in.  While Mere is away, Pamir discovers in the Ink Well the presence of a god-like entity with powers so potentially destructive that it might destroy the ship and its millions. Faced with an entity that might prevent the Ship from ever leaving the Ink Well, the Ship's only hope now rests in the ingenuity of the vast crew . . . and with Mere, who has not contacted them since she left the Ship… With the excitement of epic science fiction adventure set against a universe full of wonders, the odyssey of the Ship and its captains will capture the hearts of science fiction readers.",Paperback,,448 pages,"

Among the dozen thought-provoking tales is the never-before-published ""Abducted Souls,"" about a college student who becomes increasingly unsure of himself and his self-worth when the alien abduction he experienced as a child is questioned. Also included is the Asimov's Science Fiction Reader's Choice Awardwinning ""Savior,"" about a military commander who is held accountable for tortuous acts that may have saved the human race. The hot topic of cloning is discussed in futuristic terms in the title tale, ""The Cuckoo's Boys,"" which tells of a lonely genius who clones himself, not once, but millions of times, and of a teacher who tests and challenges three of these clones. Two ageless aliens become friends with Ash, an immortal human, as he strives to help them recover lost memories in ""Night of Time,"" a selection taken from the popular Marrow book.

","(Book). Lou Reed has been art-rocker, iconoclast, contrary noise merchant, and junkie, yet he's always been fascinating. Only David Bowie, arguably, has re-invented himself as many times as Reed, while ensuring that each image was potent, edgy and dangerous. It's a tribute to Reed's standing that even punk rockers, with their scorched earth policy towards all pre-punk music, had a healthy respect and regard for him. Velvet Underground is one of the all-time greats; but in many people's eyes, Reed has produced his best work solo, after the demise of that band. This groundbreaking book analyzes and celebrates the willful intellect, fierce intelligence, and literary merits of Lou Reed's post-Velvet Underground music. Chris Roberts has written about music for fifteen years for The Guardian, Melody Maker, Sounds, and Uncut . He was also the editor of Idol Worship (Harper Collins), a collection of writings by pop stars (Bono, Thurston Moore, etc.) that has been hailed in some quarters as ""The best book about rock 'n' roll ever.""",Paperback,,142 pages,"

","The rise and growth of Washington, D. C., in the nineteenth century closely paralleled the invention and development of photography — a felicitous circumstance that made possible this valuable photographic record of the early years of the nation's capital. Culled from the archives of the Library of Congress, Smithsonian, Columbia Historical Society, and other sources, these 224 rare prints (including works by such Victorian-era cameramen as Brady, Bishop, Plumbe, Hiller, Peale, et al.) constitute a vivid and enduring record of a city in progress — from sparsely settled provincial southern town to majestic seat of national power and influence.In spite of their vintage (over half are pre-1900; the earliest a striking 1846 daguerreotype of the Capitol under construction), these priceless views retain an undiminished precision and clarity of detail that brings old Washington into sharp focus — timeless reminders of how a city and its people looked as a metropolis of pomp and power grew up about them. From the slums of Purdy Court to the turreted mansions of Dupont Circle, from the massive marble monuments of ""Federal"" Washington, to the humble shops and saloons of 7th Street, these rare pictures recall places and events steeped in meaning for a nation and its citizens: Lincoln's first inauguration (1861); Ford̍'s Theater draped in mourning (1865); Grand Review of the Union Army (1865); Old Willard Hotel (housed Nathaniel Hawthorne, Lincoln, Grant, Tyler, Pierce); portrait of Frederick Douglass and family (1885); homes of Dolley Madison and Francis Scott Key; Women’s Suffrage Parade (1913); and many other historic, social, and geographic landmarks.This rich gallery of contemporary views also reveals nineteenth-century Washington as a showplace of architectural styles (Gothic Revival, Romanesque, Classical, Italian Renaissance, Victorian, etc.) employed to stunning effect by the master builders of the age: James Renwick (Smithsonian, Corcoran Gallery of Art); Benjamin Latrobe and Charles Bulfinch (Capitol); Robert Mills (Old Post Office, Patent Office, Treasury Building); Andrew Jackson Downing (Francis Dodge House); Henry Hobson Richardson (Henry Adams House), and many others.Side by side with its architectural splendor, the mundane life of the city is recaptured in remarkable images of an era when beer was a nickel a bottle and cows still grazed within sight of the Capitol. Here are turn-of-the-century schoolchildren admiring the newly opened Library of Congress; summer crowds mingling on the White House lawn in the administration of Chester Arthur; an Easter Monday egg-roll in 1898; Marine Band concerts; idyllic outings at Rock Creek Park; bone-shaking rides on a velocipede; parades, celebrations, inaugurations, and many other vignettes of people, neighborhoods, and daily life.The photos are arranged in an east-to-west geographic sequence (Capitol Hill to Georgetown) that roughly parallels the historic development of the city. Robert Reed has provided an informative introduction and captions, enhancing the unique and irreplaceable value of this collection. Historians, photographers, architects, visitors — anyone interested in the process by which a muddy village on the banks of the Potomac became one of the great capitals of the world — will want to have this book.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","Two of the most fertile types of myth and legend are the Celtic and the Arthurian. For the first time these are brought together in an authoritative guide to the people, places, events and traditions associated with Arthur and Ireland, Wales and the Celtic fringe. Based on wide research and reflecting the latest scholarship, A Companion to Arthurian and Celtic Myths and Legends provides us with a unique reference tool to some of the most colourful stories and traditions in history. From Gidolin to Lancelot, Tir na n-og to Morgan-le-Fay, and Aed Ruadh to Zel, we discover a wealth of material. Lancelot and Guinevere's love story has been retold many times; that Gidolin was a dwarf who was said to keep flasks of hag's blood warm on the 'hearth of hell' is less well-known. Aed Ruadh was a tyrannical king whose own champion invoked the powers of the sea, sun, wind and firmament against him; Zel is a mythical king who is said to have been buried on horseback within Silbury Hill. Romance, magic, betrayal, humour and horror are mixed together within the pages of Mike Dixon-Kennedy's intriguing book. It encompasses the Celtic Golden Age, the invasion of the Romanz when Celtic society began to collapse, and the later Celtic revival in the Gaelic countries of Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and in England. This richly illustrated A-Z guide is a must-have for all those enthralled by Arthurian history and the Celts, mythology and legends",Hardcover,,438 pages,"

","This book focuses on how and why various cultures have appropriated the story of King Arthur. It is about re-vision, how cultures alter inherited texts and are, in turn, changed by them, and it deals with the ways in which various cultures have empowered the Arthurian legend so that power might be derived from it. The authors suggest that the vitality of the Arthurian legend resides in its ability to be transformed and to transform, in its potential for appropriation and use.Culture and the King deals with issues of literature, history, art, politics, economics, gender study, and popular culture. It crosses the boundaries traditionally erected around these disciplines and addresses emerging critical methodologies concerned with the ""poetics of culture.""",Paperback,,324 pages,"

","Life in a Medieval City evokes every aspect of city life in the Middle Ages by depicting in detail what it was like to live in a prosperous city of Northwest Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The time is A.D. 1250 and the city is Troyes, capital of the county of Champagne and site of two of the cycle Champagne Fairs—the “Hot Fair” in August and the “Cold Fair” in December. European civilization has emerged from the Dark Ages and is in the midst of a commercial revolution. Merchants and money men from all over Europe gather at Troyes to buy, sell, borrow, and lend, creating a bustling market center typical of the feudal era. As the Gieses take us through the day-to-day life of burghers, we learn the customs and habits of lords and serfs, how financial transactions were conducted, how medieval cities were governed, and what life was really like for a wide range of people.For serious students of the medieval era and anyone wishing to learn more about this fascinating period, Life in a Medieval City remains a timeless work of popular medieval scholarship.",Paperback,1st Harper colophon Edition,274 pages,"

By asking the simple question, What if magic were a finite resource?, Niven brought to life a mesmerizing world of wonder and loss, of hope and despair. The success of his first story collection, The Magic Goes Away, birthed two sequel anthologies, The Magic May Return and More Magic. All three volumes are collected here for the first time, with stories by Niven himself, as well as contributions by such luminaries of fantasy as Roger Zelazny, Fred Saberhagen, Steven Barnes, and Poul Anderson.  Featuring a brand-new introduction by Larry Niven, The Magic Goes Away Collection gives readers insight into the breathtaking world of Niven and Jerry Pournelle's The Burning City and Burning Tower and stands on its own as a landmark in fantasy fiction",Paperback,,368 pages,"

","In this book, which accompanies and expands on his Channel 4 television series, leading archaeologist Francis Pryor retells the story of King Arthur, legendary king of the Britons, tracing it back to its Bronze Age origins The legend of King Arthur and Camelot is one of the most enduring in Britain's history, spanning centuries and surviving invasions by Angles, Vikings and Normans. In his latest book Francis Pryor -- one of Britain's most celebrated archaeologists and author of the acclaimed Britain B.C. and Seahenge -- traces the story of Arthur back to its ancient origins. Putting forth the compelling idea that most of the key elements of the Arthurian legends are deeply rooted in Bronze and Iron Ages (the sword Excalibur, the Lady of the Lake, the Sword in the Stone and so on), Pryor argues that the legends' survival mirrors a flourishing, indigenous culture that endured through the Roman occupation of Britain, and the subsequent invasions of the so-called Dark Ages. As in Britain B.C., Pryor roots his story in the very landscape, from Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, to South Cadbury Castle in Somerset and Tintagel in Cornwall. He traces the story back to the 5th-century King Arthur and beyond, all the time testing his ideas with archaeological evidence, and showing how the story was manipulated through the ages for various historical and literary purposes, by Geoffrey of Monmouth and Malory among others. Delving into history, literary sources -- ancient, medieval and romantic -- and archaeological research, Francis Pryor creates an original, lively and illuminating account of this most British of legends.",Hardcover,,268 pages,"

","King Arthur of the Britons - the Celtic hero supreme. But was he a king? Where did he come from? Wales? England? In this book Stuart McHardy re-investigates the 19th century idea that Arthur originated in Scotland. Combining interpretation of the earliest written sources with a new approach to the content of orally transmitted traditional tales he has come up with a picture of Arthur unlike any before. Stripping away the later romanticised notions of a feudal king surrounded by fair maidens and jousting knights McHardy takes us back to a 6th century Britain where battle was endemic amongst the tribes and no warrior would follow a man he did not honour. Into this ancient society a new force came that changed things forever. The Romans had long been gone but behind them they left a ticking time bomb that exploded into tribal society changing it forever. That time-bomb was the new religion of Christianity and at the front of the battle against the ancient traditional pagan religion was the war band leader we know as Arthur. Modelling himself on a hero in traditional belief he led the Christian Britons against the pagan alliance of Angles, Picts and Scots - Germanic and Celtic speakers united in arms - who together had regularly attacked the might of Rome for centuries. Much of the fighting took place around the Gap of Stirling, Scotland's battleground from prehistoric times through to the 18th century. Here where the different societies met and mingled Arthur led a crusade that not only led to a change in religion of the native peoples but laid the basis for the development of the later kingdoms of north Britain, and eventually Scotland itself. There was no invasion for Arthur to fight, the Angles and Saxons came slowly, over centuries, but he was leading a crusade - for the new religion against the old. As the language of the Britons drew back into Wales, most of the great tales of the hero went with them, leaving a few handfuls of scattered traditions and placenames around Scotland. Now in the light of recent scholarship, and with new insights into the old pagan religion, McHardy has gathered these scraps together and combined them with the Welsh memories of the Men of the North to paint a picture of Arthur closer to reality than has been possible before now.",Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","In this original look at the world of Arthur, the authors show how the people of medieval England engaged with the Arthurian legend. Individual chapters cover Winchester as the site of Camelot, the crown of Arthur presented by Edward I, and the various items associated with Dover, Glastonbury Abbey, and other sites. Far from being credulous and gullible, it is clear that people actively debated Arthurian history. The book concludes with a discussion of the 16th-century antiquarian John Leland and those who followed in his footsteps, continuing to search for the physical remains of Arthur and his court.",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","In August 1930, on a voyage from Madras to London, a young Indian looked up at the stars and contemplated their fate. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar--Chandra, as he was called--calculated that certain stars would suffer a strange and violent death, collapsing to virtually nothing. This extraordinary claim, the first mathematical description of black holes, brought Chandra into direct conflict with Sir Arthur Eddington, one of the greatest astrophysicists of the day. Eddington ridiculed the young man's idea at a meeting of the Royal Astronomy Society in 1935, sending Chandra into an intellectual and emotional tailspin--and hindering the progress of astrophysics for nearly forty years. Empire of the Stars is the dramatic story of this intellectual debate and its implications for twentieth-century science. Arthur I. Miller traces the idea of black holes from early notions of ""dark stars"" to the modern concepts of wormholes, quantum foam, and baby universes. In the process, he follows the rise of two great theories--relativity and quantum mechanics--that meet head on in black holes. Empire of the Stars provides a unique window into the remarkable quest to understand how stars are born, how they live, and, most portentously (for their fate is ultimately our own), how they die. It is also the moving tale of one man's struggle against the establishment--an episode that sheds light on what science is, how it works, and where it can go wrong. Miller exposes the deep-seated prejudices that plague even the most rational minds. Indeed, it took the nuclear arms race to persuade scientists to revisit Chandra's work from the 1930s, for the core of a hydrogen bomb resembles nothing so much as an exploding star. Only then did physicists realize the relevance, truth, and importance of Chandra's work, which was finally awarded a Nobel Prize in 1983. Set against the waning days of the British Empire and taking us right up to the present, this sweeping history examines the quest to understand one of the most forbidding phenomena in the universe, as well as the passions that fueled that quest over the course of a century.",Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","Many engage in the quest, but no biographer yet has captured the enigmatic Doyle. Conan Doyle deliberately obscured his life, and his heirs remain keen to guard his papers. Yet the contributors—Conan Doyle scholars and collectors, English literature professors, research librarians, editors, and critics—concur that better biographical material is needed and that now—100 years after the birth of Sherlock Holmes—is an appropriate time to examine the biographical problems. They concentrate on the ways Conan Doyle himself and his biographers have handled these problems—or failed to handle them. In the process of evaluating and criticizing earlier biographical efforts, the contributors present an effective portrait of Conan Doyle. All agree, however, that much more remains to be done, and they suggest fruitful areas for further research.",Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","In this brilliant and startling collection, Tom La Farge revises and rethinks many traditional plots and characteristics of the fable, concentrating on the French fabliaux, whose medieval practitioners were, in their turn, inspired by the tales of ancient times. Lovers of literature will discover in La Farge's remarkable work a host of radical, occasionally shocking, yet unfailingly poetic renderings of familiar favorites such as ""The Fox and the Crow,"" ""The Wolf and the Lamb,"" and ""The Matron of Ephesus,"" among others. Stories such as ""The Image Breaker"" and ""Marion and Alison"" recast classic sexual themes with appropriately erotic language for 1990s readers. Longer pieces, notably ""The Innocents,"" and ""The Dead Come Back to Life"" are soaring flights of complex imagery. La Farge's woundrously creative powers are well known to his many readers of the two-part fantasy novel, The Crimson Bears (The Crimson Bears and A Hundred Doors), both published by Sun & Moon Press. But even his warmest admirers will respond with awe to the heightened dimensions of the literary gifts displayed in this landmark collection.",Paperback,,116 pages,"

","Dragons, unicorns, griffins, and sea monsters are only some of the many fantastic animals that continue to enthrall people, even though such creatures exist only in our imaginations. As such, they have animated human folklore for thousands of years, serving as metaphors for our fears, hopes, dreams, and struggles. Here is a modern collection of lore that reflects many different cultures as it focuses on a panoply of fantastic animals. From ancient Greece came the griffin, a combination eagle and lion who guarded a treasure of gold, and whose feathers gave sight to the blind. From Egypt came the mysterious Sphinx, half human and half lion, and from Persia came Karkadan, a large, ferocious, one-horned monster who could be captured and subdued only by a young maiden. Not all mythical beasts are fierce. Lung and other Chinese dragons are cheerful and benevolent, and Drakon was reputed to be a loyal guard of the Greeks' sacred springs and treasures. This profusely illustrated book tells stories of winged birds, scaled serpents, and legendary sea creatures. It also features a unique family tree of legendary bestial correspondences that traces dragon relationships from one culture's folklore to another. The more than 130 fantastic and vivid illustrations are all in color.",Hardcover,,128 pages,"

","In the mist-shrouded haze of the past, the world of Azeroth teemed with wondrous creatures of every kind. Mysterious Elves and hardy Dwarves walked among tribes of man in relative peace and harmony -- until the arrival of the demonic army known as Burning Legion shattered the world's tranquility forever. Now Orcs, Dragons, Goblins, and Trolls all vie for supremacy over the scattered, warring kingdoms -- part of a grand, malevolent scheme that will determine the fate of the world of WarCraft  A terrifying upheaval among the highest ranks of the world's Wizards sends the maverick Mage, Rhonin, on a perilous journey into the Orc-controlled lands of Khaz Modan. What Rhonin uncovers is a vast, far-reaching conspiracy, darker than anything he ever imagined -- a threat that will force him into a dangerous alliance with ancient creatures of air and re if the world of Azeroth is to see another dawn.",Paperback,,378 pages,"

","Imaginary beasts have figured prominently in literary works ever since the ancient world, when these myths were first formulated. But the nineteenth century witnessed the rise of science, the discovery of geological findings that challenged the biblical myth of creation, and the birth of Darwin's theory of evolution. Since then, monsters have evolved from supernatural creatures to natural ones endowed with exceptional size, strength, or intelligence. This book explores both literary and cinematic texts that are especially explicit in their Darwinian portrayal of monstrous beasts, though these creatures retain an archaic mythological quality. The myth of Leviathan and Behemoth, for instance, is as central to Jaws as it is to Moby-Dick; indeed, Jaws inherits the myth directly from Moby-Dick,  as does King Kong. These and other monster tales, such as The Creature from the Black Lagoon and Grendel,  keep the ancient myth alive and relevant by recasting it in the context of biological and cultural evolution.There is a pattern of alternating bestialization and anthropomorphism in many monster tales, suggesting that these images are being displayed in repeated attempts to define who we are in relation to animals. Thus the more beastly the monster, the more insistently we erect the old paradigm of the Ladder of Being, placing ourselves on a higher and separate rung; but the more human-like the creature, the more readily we shift to the paradigm of the Tree of Life, in which all creatures are more closely related. Since the matter of distinctions between species also involves questions of race, the monster myth is often conscripted to serve racist agendas. But more often than not, the myth has an anti-racist subtext that undercuts the hierarchy. The closing chapters of the volume consider the notion of artificial evolution in works such as The Island of Dr. Moreau,  and human-machine interaction in Gravity's Rainbow. As fables of identity, monster tales dramatize our anxieties and fears about our own animal nature and provide a means of coming to terms with our evolution.",Hardcover,,200 pages,"

","Dinosaur memories are hard to forget! Most who revel in the current renaissance in dinosaur science, art, fiction and movies, or who enjoy the other appealing prehistoric animals so well popularized by the media have fond recollections of what it was like “growing up dinosaur.” Together with wife Diane and his father Allen G. Debus, Allen A. Debus unveils treasured dinosaur memories and stories about prehistoric animals and paleo-people, spanning from the cold-blooded dinosaur ‘era,’ to the modern wave dinosaur renaissance. Beginning with fondly recalled roadtrips to prehistoric places where T. rex still reigns, Dinosaur Memories ventures into the realm of thunder beasts and explores the rich ‘pop-cultural’ appeal of prehistoric animals. If you’ve ever collected dinosaurs, enjoyed fossil hunting or visits to see the old bones in museums, Dinosaur Memories is a book you’ll still recall years from now! Thirty-five chapters are grouped into seven sections titled, “Roads Into Prehistory,” “Thunder Beasts,” “Dinosaur Worlds,” “Fantasy Dinosaurs,” “Fossil Trickery,” “Paleo-people,” and “Rustlin’ up Dinos.”",Paperback,,640 pages,"

","Easy-to-follow instructions for drawing a variety of creatures, from an Eastern dragon to a hairy trollThe ever-increasing popularity of mythological and fantasy creatures in film, graphic novels, and television creates high demand for instruction books on drawing these fantastic beasts. In this newest addition to our Collector's series, aspiring artists will find 144 pages of clear, step-by-step instructions for drawing everything from fire-breathing dragons to seven-headed monsters and magical fairies. Information on the origin and history of mythological creatures gives this book an extra-special appeal. The author's helpful tips on shading and drawing techniques show readers everything they need to know to create their own impressive beasts.Although there are fantasy-themed drawing books on the market, this book is unique because it features a wide range of fantasy subjects rather than focusing on only one type of creature (such as dragons or fairies). It also sets itself apart from similar books with its helpful information on combining graphite pencil with other media, such as charcoal and black watercolor paint or ink. In addition, this extraordinary book features dragons and other mythological creatures from around the world, including those originating in Egyptian, Irish, Norse, and Greek mythology-whereas most other fantasy books include generic, non-regional subjects.",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","In Nancy Springer’s enthralling fourth volume of the Book of Isle, two young princes set out to destroy their own father and the pervasive evil that poisons the kingdom An epic saga set in an ageless island stronghold of magic and mystery, Nancy Springer’s Book of Isle series is considered by many to be among the most accomplished offerings in all of fantasy literature, as lyrical and inventive as the classic works of J. R. R. Tolkien. In this unforgettable novel, a violent rift in a royal house threatens to tear an entire kingdom asunder.   The next in line to rule the troubled realm of Melior, Prince Tirell gave his heart to the gentle and beautiful peasant girl Mylitta. But she died at the cruel whim of Tirell’s father, the king, who insists on a more politically expedient match for his rebellious son. Since the murder of his love, Tirell’s heart has hardened, and now, with the aid of his younger brother, Frain, the healer, he seeks an army that will help him defeat the evil, unrepentant monarch. All hope for victory in the war to come awaits the brothers somewhere deep in the mysteries of the Vale, where a beautiful goddess also dwells. But a sinister presence is spreading its malevolence throughout the land—and Melior can never again be truly whole until the kingdom is rid of the terrible scourge of the Black Beast.",Paperback,,192 pages,"

","The dragon, phoenix, griffin, unicorn, and a host of other strange and magical animals of the imagination appear in widely diverse writings scattered throughout literature across millennia. The Book of Fabulous Beasts is the first comprehensive collection of such Western writings, from ancient epics of creation to modern fantasy. Comprising hundreds of entries arranged chronologically by author, this unique anthology is both a source book on fantastic beasts and a composite history of these enduring creatures. In works from Herodotus and Pliny the Elder to medieval bestiaries and travelers' tales, and from Renaissance heraldry, literature, and natural histories to the fantasy fiction of Tolkien, resilient imaginary beings long believed to be real have evolved through time, surviving even the Age of Reason that deemed them ""fabulous."" Excerpts from these and other primary sources, including the Bible, Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, and Goethe, reflect the development not only of unnatural animals but of the Western imagination itself.",Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","A dictionary? No, this is really an astonishing ark filled with beasts from a fabulous zoo far more varied and entertaining than anything from ordinary natural history. From Abaia and Abath to Ziz and Zu, from the microscopic Gigelorum that nests in a mite's ear to the giant serpent Jormungandor who encircles the whole globe, there are beasts from every corner of man's imagination: the light-hearted Fearsome Critters of lumberjack tales find a place alongside the Sirrush of Babylon and the Winged Bulls of Assyria. Some of the fabulous beasts turn out to be real creatures in disguise - a Cameleopard is a kind of glamourised giraffe -while others are almost, but not quite, human. Among the six hundred entries are some which are full-scale essays in their own right, as on Phoenix or Giants; and just in case it seems as though the authors dreamt up the entire book, there is a detailed list of books for the would-be hunter in this mythical jungle.",Paperback,,168 pages,"

","This collection of fifty-two poems from the author of Angel Fire and Anonymous Sins explores the annihilation of the time-bound ego, a liberating, sometimes terrifying experience for all who live within the ""fabulous beast"" of history and nature. The poems explore the shifting, elusive point at which the inwardness of individual experience touches upon the larger consciousness of a species or an era, forming a connection with a ""self"" that goes beyond subjectivity. The poems are grouped into four parts: ""Broken Connections,"" ""Forbidden Testimonies,"" ""The Child-Martyr"" and ""A Posthumous Sketch,"" are prose poems which, though technically different from the others, are concerned with the same theme-the relationship between the individual and a larger, all-inclusive whole. Neither fatalistic nor rebellious, the poems convey the idea that as long as we live in time we must struggle, and that is this struggle that determines our humanity.",Paperback,,86 pages,"

","Sphinxes, hydras, chimeras, dragons, unicorns, griffins, sirens, and centaurs--fantastic animals can be found in works from Greek vases to paintings by Bosch, Goya, and Picasso, from folk art to comic strips, advertising, and Hollywood movies. Here Be Dragons is a lavishly illustrated compendium of the marvelous menagerie of imaginary animals that humans have conjured up over the ages. Ariane and Christian Delacampagne take us on a visually and intellectually riveting journey through five thousand years of art, examining the symbolic meanings of such creatures and what they say about the unconscious life of the human mind. In the Middle Ages, ""bestiary"" referred to an edifying poem, in Latin or French verse, in which the moral characteristics of real or imaginary animals were highlighted. With the passing of time, this once-flourishing genre disappeared. We have ceased to equate animals that can be observed with those we only dream of, but neither science nor mass culture has managed to chase away imaginary beasts. Such creatures continue to haunt us, just as they haunted our ancestors. In the first book to explore this subject with such cross-cultural and chronological range, the Delacampagnes identify five basic structures (unicorn, human-headed animal, animal-headed human, winged quadruped, and dragon) whose stories they relate from prehistory to the present day. They also provide fascinating sociological and psychoanalytical insight into the processes through which artists have created these astonishing animals and how they have been transmitted from culture to culture. Contrary to what people once believed, the fantastic exists only in the mind. And yet, as Here Be Dragons shows us, it is one of the mind's most sophisticated, mysterious, and inspiring creations.",Hardcover,,200 pages,"

It has long been a business article of faith that great companies, by definition, constantly focus on maximizing their revenues year after year. Yet quietly, under the radar, a growing number of undeniably great compabnies have rejected the pressure of endless growth to focus on more satisfying business goals. Veteran journalist Bo Burlingham takes us deep inside fourteen of these remarkable comapnies that have chosen to march to their own drummer. He shows the leaders of these small giants recognized the full range of choices they had about the type of company they could create and made the choice to pursue greateness by placing other goals ahead of getting as big as possible as fast as possible. And he shows how we can all benefit by questioning the conventional definitions of business success.""",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Creativity is crucial to business success. But too often, even the most innovative organization quickly becomes a ""giant hairball""--a tangled, impenetrable mass of rules, traditions, and systems, all based on what worked in the past--that exercises an inexorable pull into mediocrity. Gordon McKenzie worked at Hallmark Cards for thirty years, many of which he spent inspiring his colleagues to slip the bonds of Corporate Normalcy and rise to orbit--to a mode of dreaming, daring and doing above and beyond the rubber-stamp confines of the administrative mind-set. In his deeply funny book, exuberantly illustrated in full color, he shares the story of his own professional evolution, together with lessons on awakening and fostering creative genius.Originally self-published and already a business ""cult classic"", this personally empowering and entertaining look at the intersection between human creativity and the bottom line is now widely available to bookstores. It will be a must-read for any manager looking for new ways to invigorate employees, and any professional who wants to achieve his or her best, most self-expressive, most creative and fulfilling work.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

She has come all the way from Vancouver Island, Canada, to take care of the children while their parents are away, and right from the start Aunt Sally enchants them with tales of her childhood with their father. Odd characters figure largely in the stories, like Maud, a hunter rumored to have killed eighty cougars; Great-uncle Louis, a health nut who insists everyone should gnaw on sticks for extra fiber; and Fat Little Mean Girl, the star of a cautionary tale involving witchcraft and candy. All of Aunt Sally's reminiscences lead up to a crucial story about trolls, sinister creatures who supposedly lurked along the shore at night. The trolls had the power to change Aunt Sally's life forever, and their legacy may change the lives of the three present-day children as well.",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","In this spectacular follow-up to their beloved Book of Norse Myths, the husband-and-wife team of Ingri and Edgar Parin d'Aulaire explore the uncanny reaches of Norse mythology, an enchanted night-world populated by trolls of all kinds--mountain trolls, forest trolls, trolls who live underwater and trolls who live under bridges, uncouth, unkempt, unbreakable, unforgettable, and invariably unbelievably ugly trolls--who work their wiles and carry on in the most bizarre and entertaining fashions.With their matchless talent as storytellers and illustrators, the d'Aulaires bring to life the weird and wonderful world of Norse mythology.",Hardcover,,76 pages,"

","Everyone has their rough nights, but things have clearly taken a turn for the surreal when Angel, a young photographer, finds a group of drunken teenagers in the courtyard of his apartment building, taunting a young troll. Trolls are known in Scandinavian mythology as wild beasts like the werewolf, but this troll is just a small, wounded creature. Angel decides to offer it a safe haven for the night. In the morning Angel thinks he dreamed it all. But he finds the troll alive, well, and drinking from his toilet. What does one do with a troll in the city?Angel begins researching frantically. Angel searches the Internet, folklore, nature journals, and newspaper clippings, but his research doesn't tell him that trolls exude pheromones that have a profound aphrodisiac effect on all those around him. As Angel's life changes beyond recognition, it becomes clear that the troll is familiar with the man's most forbidden feelings, and that it may take him across lines he never thought he'd cross. A novel of sparkling originality, Troll is a wry, peculiar, and beguiling story of nature and man's relationship to wild things, and of the dark power of the wildness in ourselves.",Paperback,,278 pages,"

","For more than two decades, Ray Troll has been luring, hooking, and landing fans around the world with his zany, irreverent, and often surreal art. Featured in museums, galleries, and books, as well as on immensely popular T-shirts, his work—part natural history adventure and part underground comic—depicts beautiful and accurately drawn fish of all kinds, Northwest Coast totems, Freud and Darwin, fossils, resurrections of extinct animals, and much more. Rapture of the Deep collects some of Troll's best-known art along with many images never before published. The book makes powerful connections between biological diversity, the evolution of life on earth, and the careless habits of people. Rapture of the Deep celebrates Troll's vision with legendary works including ""Spawn Till You Die,"" ""Life's a Fish and Then You Fry,"" and ""Bassackwards,"" in which fish use money, liquor, and literature as bait to lure humans. Troll's running commentary reveals the thought and inspiration behind his art. Writer Brad Matsen, Troll's longtime coconspirator, adds a lively introduction to the art and life of his ""sole"" brother.",Hardcover,,148 pages,"

","A wicked adventure—or deadly…trollble.For sixteen-year-old harpist prodigy Moira, the annual Dairy Princess event in Vanderby is just another lame publicity ""op."" Moira a dairy princess? Get real. Twelve girls have been selected to have their likeness carved in butter and displayed on the Trollholm Bridge. It's a Vanderby State Fair tradition that has been going on for, like, ever.As far as Moira is concerned, the sooner it's over with the butter—er—better.About the same time and not far away, three brothers—members of the sensationally popular teen boy band The Griffsons—are in the middle of a much needed road trip to relax from the pressures of their latest tour.In a flash, however, the kids are suddenly transported to a strange and mystical wilderness where they find themselves in the middle of a deadly tug-of-war struggle between a magical fox named Fossegrim and the monstrous troll Aenmarr of Austraegir. At the heart of the feud is a battle for possession of a mysterious magical fiddle—and an ancient compact between Trollholm and the outer world.Whatever. All Moira cares about is that eleven of her fellow princesses have been enchanted into a slumber and Moira needs to figure out a way to awaken them…and get home.Unfortunately for Moira and the Griffsons, nothing in Trollholm is as it seems. Finding a way out of Trollholm may be a lot more difficult than they think.",Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","As tall as trees and as ancient and rugged as the Norwegian landscape from which they come, trolls are some of lore's most fascinating and varied creatures. Some live under bridges, others deep inside caves. They can carry their heads under their arms or hide their hearts inside wells. They can walk across oceans and fly over mountains. Trees and shrubs may grow from their heads, and their noses can be long enough to stir soup. There are troll hags, troll daughters, and elderly, shrunken trolls. Old or young, they are quarrelsome, ugly, and boastful, and they love to trick princesses and children. To defeat them, children must rely on the strengths of their humanity-persistence, kindness, pluck, and willingness to heed good advice",Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Gnomes is the product of Rien Poortvliet and Wil Huygen's observation of the local gnome population in Holland. Until Gnomes was first published in Dutch in 1976, these friendly nocturnal creatures were only represented in folk lore; descriptions were often incomplete or simply inaccurate. Poortvliet and Huygen, having studied and interviewed gnomes for two decades, set out to fill this gap with their own encyclopedic tome. Gnomes covers all areas of gnome culture, including architecture, education, courtship, medicine, industry, and relationships with other mythical creatures. Huygen's sober descriptions are balanced by Poortvliet's light-hearted portrayals of gnomes at work and at play. Thirty years later, this beautifully illustrated volume continues to engage and enchant readers of all ages.",Hardcover,30th Anniversary Edition,232 pages,"

","Lord Vishnu's Love Handles is the story of a man who is teetering on the edge of financial ruin and insanity until a couple of secret agents teach him what it really means to lose his mind. Travis Anderson has a psychic gift. Or so he thinks. So far he's milked his premonitions only to acquire an upper-middle-class lifestyle — pretty wife, big house, and a shiny Range Rover — without having to make any real effort. But recent visions threaten his yuppie contentment. Haunted by omens of impending cancers, stillborn babies, and personal train wrecks, he is compelled to make a series of inaccurate and horrifying prophecies that humiliate him in front of his fellow country club members. The IRS gets Travis's number, too, demanding an audit of his sloppy bookkeeping. Drowning in mounting financial problems and apparent mental illness, Travis tries booze, pills, even golf to stay afloat, but nothing works. His wife and friends are forced to stage an intervention. Travis is in danger of losing his family, his career, and ultimately, his sanity. That is, until he meets a Hindu holy man in rehab who claims to be the final incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Suddenly, the tragically shallow Travis is saddled with the responsibility of bettering mankind and saving the world.",Audio CD,,0 pages,"

Developed in partnership with the GNOME Foundation, this book is for programmers working with the GNOME 2 desktop environment.

","Invasive nonindigenous species - plants and animals that have been introduced to an ecosystem from someplace else - are wreaking havoc around the globe. Because they did not coevolve with species already in the ecosystem, they can profoundly disturb species interactions and ecosystem function. The state of Florida has one of the most severe exotic species problems in the country; many taxa in Florida are as much as one-quarter non-native, and millions of acres of land and water are dominated by nonindigenous species. Strangers in Paradise provides an in-depth examination of the Florida experience and of the ongoing efforts to eradicate or manage introduced species. Strangers in Paradise is the first comprehensive volume to address a large, diverse region and the full range of nonindigenous species, the problems they cause, and the methods and impediments to dealing with them. Throughout, contributors emphasize solutions and relate the situation in Florida to problems faced by other states, making the book an important guide for anyone involved with control and management of invasive species.",Paperback,,479 pages,"

Now 2005 can be named the Year of Lady Cottington with the 10th anniversary of the publication that first exposed the world to the science of fairy exploration.This volume records in authentic facsimile the latest incarnation of this notorious book along with eight additional pages and enhanced artwork throughout, virtually overflowing with freshly flattened fairies. Former Monty Python member Terry Jones and artist Brian Froud provide a new introduction to place the book in its proper perspective, offering insight into the book's often maligned historic relevance. As a bonus, included is an incriminating DVD showing rare film footage of the elderly Lady Cottington in her garden demonstrating her fairy-squashing technique, as well as a photo gallery, desktop wallpaper, and screensavers.",Hardcover,,72 pages,"

","Carefully combing his ears and tail and wearing his finest red felt boots, a furry young faery named Sneezle prepares for the Midwinter festival in Old Oak Wood -- the oldest faery court in the British Isles. All the denizens of the wood have gathered for this grand winter holiday...but this year something is strangely wrong. By now the forest should be blanketed with snow, but the air remains warm, the leaves have not fallen, and branches remain laden with autumn's fruit. Somehow, the cycle of nature has been halted, and even the faery king, Oberon, cannot fathom why winter has not arrived. From this mystery will come a great adventure, one in which young Sneezle and his best friend, Twig, will confront menacing goblins and an evil sorcerer. By turns charming, menacing, and hilarious, ""The Winter Child"" follows Sneezle and Twig as they bravely ferret out the terrible truth behind Winter's absence and witness a dramatic duel of sorcerers in which the future of the faery kingdom hangs in the balance. In this marvelous collaboration between renowned doll maker Wendy Froud and award-winning writer Terri Windling, the entrancing story twists and turns its way through the magical beauty and ominous shadows of the faeries' world. Art-directed by Brian Froud, beloved creator of such classics as ""Good Faeries/Bad Faeries,"" the book's spectacular photographs capture Sneezle, Twig, King Oberon and Queen Titania, the sorcerer Malagan, the Royal Council of Sorcerers, and the faeries of Old Oak Wood, all in such vivid detail that they seem to come alive...as indeed, perhaps, they are.Following the success of Wendy Froud and Terri Windling's first Sneezle adventure, ""A Midsummer Night'sFaery Tale,"" this new volume opens the magical window of enchantment once more with an extraordinary combination of story and art. A mythic tale of nature humbled by whim and ambition -- and of good and simple souls triumphant -- ""The Winter Child"" will be a classic among lovers of fairy tales, fantasy literature, and all things Froudian.",Hardcover,,59 pages,"

","This perennial bestseller never loses its charm. It really happened-a hoax perpetrated by two girls who claimed to have photographed actual ""fairies""; among the people caught up in the popular hysteria were Arthur Conan Doyle (who fell for it) and Harry Houdini (who did not). This remarkable parody, written by a former member of the Monty Python troupe, takes a riotously witty, visually extraordinary, and wildly original look at what went on. In every respect, this ""handwritten diary"" captures the look of the age-though the fairies, it is true, do sometimes have a more malevolent aspect than one might expect...

","Speciation is the process by which co-existing daughter species evolve from one ancestral species - e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas arising from a common ancestor around 5,000,000 years ago. However, many questions about speciation remain controversial. The Birds of Northern Melanesia provides by far the most comprehensive study yet available of a rich fauna, composed of the 195 breeding land and fresh-water bird species of the Bismarck and Solomon Archipelagoes east of New Guinea. This avifauna offers decisive advantages for understanding speciation, and includes famous examples of geographic variation discussed in textbooks of evolutionary biology. The book results from 30 years of collaboration between the evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr and the ecologist Jared Diamond. It shows how Northern Melanesian bird distributions provide snapshots of all stages in speciation, from the earliest (widely distributed species without geographic variation) to the last (closely related, reproductively isolated species occurring sympatrically and segregating ecologically). The presentation emphasizes the wide diversity of speciation outcomes, steering a middle course between one-model-fits-all simplification and ungeneralizable species accounts. Questions illuminated include why some species are much more prone to speciate than others, why some water barriers are much more effective at promoting speciation than others, and whether hypothesized taxon cycles, faunal dominance, and legacies of Pleistocene land bridges are real. These years of study have resulted in a huge database, complete with distributions of all 195 species on 76 islands, together with their taxonomy, colonization routes, ecological attributes, abundance, and overwater dispersal. Color plates depict 88 species and allospecies, many of which have never been seen before. For students of speciation, Northern Melanesian birds now constitute a model system against which other biotas can be compared. For population biologists interested in other problems besides speciation, this rich database can now be mined for insights.",Hardcover,,548 pages,"

","Galileo, Copernicus, Newton, Niels Bohr, Einstein. Their insights shook our perception of who we are and where we stand in the world, and in their wake have left an uneasy coexistence: science vs. religion, faith vs. empirical inquiry. Which is the keeper of truth? Which is the true path to understanding reality?After forty years of study with some of the greatest scientific minds, as well as a lifetime of meditative, spiritual, and philosophic study, the Dalai Lama presents a brilliant analysis of why all avenues of inquiry—scientific as well as spiritual—must be pursued in order to arrive at a complete picture of the truth. Through an examination of Darwinism and karma, quantum mechanics and philosophical insight into the nature of reality, neurobiology and the study of consciousness, the Dalai Lama draws significant parallels between contemplative and scientific examinations of reality.This breathtakingly personal examination is a tribute to the Dalai Lama’s teachers—both of science and spirituality. The legacy of this book is a vision of the world in which our different approaches to understanding ourselves, our universe, and one another can be brought together in the service of humanity.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

Now, responding to requests for more as well as to a number of recent exciting discoveries in physics and astronomy, Krauss takes a provocative look at how the laws of physics relate to notions from our popular culture -- not only Star Trek, but other films, shows, and popular lore -- from Independence Day to Star Wars to The X-Files.What's the difference between a flying saucer and a flying pretzel?Why didn't the aliens in Independence Day have to bother invading Earth to destroy it?What's new with warp drives?What's the most likely scenario for doomsday?Are ESP and telekinesis impossible?What do clairvoyance and time travel have in common?How might quantum mechanics ultimately affect the fate of life in the universe?",Paperback,,208 pages,"

Are time loops really possible, and can I kill my grandmother before I was born? Until now, fans of ""Star Trek"" were hard pressed to find answers to vital questions such as these. Now Lawrence M. Krauss, an internationally known theoretical physicist and educator, has written the quintessential physics book for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.Anyone who has ever wondered, ""Could this really happen?"" will gain useful insights into the ""Star Trek"" universe (and, incidentally, the real universe) in this charming and accessible volume. Krauss boldly goes where ""Star Trek"" has gone -- and beyond. He uses the ""Star Trek"" future as a launching pad to discuss the forefront of modern physics. From Newton to Hawking, from Einstein to Feynman, from Kirk to Janeway, Krauss leads the reader on a voyage to the world of physics as we now know it and as it might one day be.Featuring the Top 10 biggest physics bloopers in ""Star Trek,"" as selected by Nobel Prize-winning physicists and other dedicated Trekkers!""This book is fun, and Mr. Krauss has a nice touch with a tough subject...Readers drawn by frivolity will be treated to substance.""

","Will the universe continue to expand forever, reverse its expansion and begin to contract, or reach a delicately poised state where it simply persists forever? The answer depends on the amount and properties of matter in the universe, and that has given rise to one of the great paradoxes of modern cosmology: there is too little visible matter to account for the behavior we can see. Over ninety percent of the universe consists of ”missing mass” or ”dark matter” - what Lawrence Krauss, in his classic book, termed ”the fifth essence.”In this new edition of The Fifth Essence, retitled Quintessence after the now widely accepted term for dark matter, Krauss shows how the dark matter problem is now connected with two of the hottest areas in recent cosmology: the fate of the universe and the ”cosmological constant.” With a new introduction, epilogue, and chapter updates, Krauss updates his classic for 1999 and shares one of the most stunning discoveries of recent years: an anti-gravity force that explains recent observations of a permanently expanding universe.",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","[TEXT]A highly original work that deals a shattering blow to all our preconceived notions about our past and human origins. Worldwide legends refer to giant flying lizards and dragons that came to this planet and founded the ancient civilizations of Mesopo-tamia, Egypt, India and China. Who were these reptilian creatures? This book provides the answers to many of the riddles of history such as: What was the real reason for man's creation? Why did Adam lose his chance at immortality in the Garden of Eden? Who were the Nefilim who descended from heaven and mated with human women? Why did the serpent take such a bum rap in history? Why didn't Adam and Eve wear clothes in Eden? What were the ""crystals"" or ""stones"" that the ancient gods fought over? Why did the ancient Sumerians call their major gods USHUMGAL, which means literally ""great fiery, flying serpent?"" What was the role of the gigantic stone platform at Baalbek? What were the ""boats of heaven"" in ancient Egypt and the ""sky chariots"" of the Bible?",Paperback,,276 pages,"

","Here, Taoist practitioner Eva Wong offers a colorful treatment of the history and evolution of Taoism, told through traditional teaching tales. These tales, which Wong first heard as a child growing up in Hong Kong, are gleaned from the local storytellers and the uncensored chronicles known as yeshi—the wild history of China, not monitored by the official imperial scholars and historians. The stories are by turns mysterious and intriguing, passionate and violent, and they are peppered with colorful characters, including hermits, politicians, social activists, revolutionaries, scholars, scientists, and mystics.Arranged chronologically from prehistory through the early twentieth century, these stories introduce the schools in the Taoist lineages, and capture the defeats and victories of Taoism, its periods of decadence and decay, and its renewal, maturation, and spiritual triumph. Wong puts these stories into context, and shows that Taoism is a dynamic spiritual tradition, constantly changing—and being influenced by—history.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","The Shere Hite Reader presents wide-ranging analysis on the individual and society from a renowned thinker on psychosexual development. The book includes new science in addition to previously published material, reflecting Hite's three decades of work probing the roots of human identity through questionnaires and theory.For the first time Hite formalizes her thinking on male adolescence, that boys feel tortured by the new social role they are forced to assume at puberty requiring a show of superiority toward females. In new detail Hite advances her understanding that sex is political, linking the expectation on women to achieve orgasm through coitus with broader patterns of oppression. Hite discusses new research on female adolescence, challenging the ""virgin"" hymen concept, and documenting that sexual awakening often precedes puberty. Hite also argues that pornography misrepresents male sexuality (not to mention female sexuality), depicting it as singular and silly instead of ""full of intriguing, nuanced behavior involving the entire body, not just the penis.""The authoritative collection of her work, The Shere Hite Reader challenges the reader to a new way of seeing.",Paperback,,560 pages,"

","In 1942, the U.S. began to form a handpicked army to fight in Europe. What made it different is that its troops were composed of artists, actors, meteorologists, and sound technicians, and their true mission was not to fight, but to deceive the German army.Information about the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops was classified top secret until 1996. Following the declassification, Jack Kneece interviewed many of the key personnel involved in this elaborate ruse, including fashion designer Bill Blass.Until the bombing of Pearl Harbor, many Americans were opposed to becoming involved in the war in Europe, and the military was ill-prepared to fight, with only 130,000 enlisted troops and equipment left over from World War I. One solution was to create a special force that gave the illusion of 30,000 heavily armed men. In fact, there were only 1,000.German soldiers referred to them as the ""Phantom Army,"" because one moment they were in one place, and the next, they were attacking their flanks or from the rear. This small army duped the Germans successfully in 21 separate operations during World War II, many of which took place within a few hundred yards of the front lines.",Hardcover,,280 pages,"

","Book Description: ""A fairy (also fey or fae or faerie; collectively, wee folk, good folk, people of peace, and other euphemisms) is the name given to an alleged metaphysical spirit or supernatural being.The fairy is based on the fae of medieval Western European (Old French) folklore and romance. Fairies are often identified with related beings of other mythologies (see list of beings referred to as fairies). Even in folklore that uses the term ""fairy,"" there are many definitions of what constitutes a fairy. Sometimes the term is used to describe any magical creature, including goblins or gnomes: at other times, the term only describes a specific type of more ethereal creature.Fairies are generally described as human in appearance and as having magical powers. Their origins are less clear in the folklore, being variously the dead, or some form of angel, or a species completely independent of humans or angels. Folklorists have suggested that their actual origin lies in a conquered race living in hiding, or in religious beliefs that lost currency with the advent of Christianity. These explanations are not always mutually incompatible, and they may be traceable to multiple sources.Much of the folklore about fairies revolves about protection from their malice, by such means as cold iron (fairies don't like iron and will not go near it) or charms of rowan and herbs, or avoiding offense by shunning locations known to be theirs. In particular, folklore describes how to prevent the fairies from stealing babies and substituting changelings, and abducting older people as well. Many folktales are told of fairies, and they appear as characters in stories from medieval tales of chivalry, to Victorian fairy tales, and up to the present day in modern literature.""

These seventeen related elements afford a panoply of subtle variations deriving from the systematic development of their electronic configurations, allowing a test of theory with excellent resolution. In contrast they find widespread use in even the most mundane processes such as steel making, for polishing materials and gasoline cracking catalysts. In between are exotic uses such as TV screen phosphors, lasers, high strength permanent magnets and chemical probes. This multi-volume handbook covers the entire rare earth field in an integrated manner. Each chapter is a comprehensive up-to-date, critical review of a particular segment of the field. The work offers the researcher and graduate student alike, a complete and thorough coverage of this fascinating field. . Authoritative. Comprehensive. Up-to-date. Critical.

","Alternate-cover edition can be found here Stephen Baxter's highly acclaimed first novel and the beginning of his stunning Xeelee Sequence. A spaceship from Earth accidentally crossed through a hole in space-time to a universe where the force of gravity is one billion times as strong as the gravity we know. Somehow the crew survived, aided by the fact that they emerged into a cloud of gas surrounding a black hole, which provided a breathable atmosphere. Five hundred years later, their descendants still struggle for existence, divided into two main groups. The Miners live on the Belt, a ramshackle ring of dwellings orbiting the core of a dead star, which they excavate for raw materials. These can be traded for food from the Raft, a structure built from the wreckage of the ship, on which a small group of scientists preserve the ancient knowledge which makes survival possible. Rees is a Miner whose curiosity about his world makes him stow away on a flying tree—just one of the many strange local lifeforms—carrying trade between the Belt and the Raft.",Paperback,,251 pages,"

","The Japanese are in space, the US has turned inward - flights into space have become dreams of old men and women, dreams of an age of sublimated warfare which have left behind only images of charmingly antique rocket craft. Malenfant in this universe is not the reckless adventurer of TIME. He has stayed on Earth to invest in research into what he regards as long-term thinking: SETI, using gravitational lensing to hunt for planets and Eetie signals, exploring the venerable Fermi paradox, 'If they existed, they would be here'. When Nemoto, a Japanese researcher on the Moon, discovers evidence of the activity of extraterrestrial intelligences in the solar system, she is unable to reconcile her observations with the accepted paradigm. Instead of publishing her findings, she seeks Malenfant's opinion: he travels to the Moon, ostensibly to lecture on SETI, in fact to answer Nemoto's question: WHY NOW? Nemoto and Malenfant share the certainty that the resources of all nations on Earth are needed to respond to this, and this was her reason for summoning Malenfant. But deeper layers of Fermi's paradox unravel against a backdrop of violently mixed reactions to the revelation that alien beings, dubbed the Gaijin, also inhabit the solar system. It's like the Gaijin are e-mailing themselves from star to star, and are not really there at all - though others might be. In this confusion Malenfant disappears in space and Nemoto becomes a recluse in a Lunar cave - both are hatching plans to confront a threat only they can bring themselves to fully believe in...",Paperback,,455 pages,"

","Hailed by Arthur C. Clarke as ""a major new talent,"" Stephen Baxter is one of the most gifted writers to appear in the last decade. His stunning novels combine state-of-the-art scientific speculation with nonstop adventure on a cosmic scale, continuing the grand tradition of science fiction pioneered by such giants as Isaac Asimov and Robert E. Heinlein.Now the multi-award-winning author gives us his most ambitious and accomplished novel yet. Audaciously conceived, brilliantly executed, it is nothing less than a masterpiece--an unforgettable race through and against time itself, with the fate of the universe and all mankind hanging in the balance.The year is 2010. More than a century of ecological damage, industrial and technological expansion, and unchecked population growth has left the Earth on the brink of devastation. But as the world's governments turn inward, one man dares to gamble on a bolder, brighter future. That man--Reid Malenfant--has a very different solution to the problems plaguing the planet: the exploration and colonization of space.Battling national sabotage and international outcry, Malenfant's bootstrap company builds a spacecraft, plots its course, and trains the genetically enhanced Sheena 5 for her one-way journey. As apocalyptic riots sweep the globe, Malenfant launches the rocket. But Sheena has plans of her own. And even as she sets them in motion, the situation on Earth grows more desperate and violent.Now Malenfant--together with a brilliant but disturbed mathematician, a child prodigy, and his ex-wife--must gamble the very existence of time and space on a single desperate throw of the dice.

","Phase Space is a collection of 25 SF stories by Stephen Baxter, many thematically linked to his ""Manifold"" trilogy (Time, Space and Origin) and other novels of cosmic scope.  ""The phase space of a system is the set of all conceivable states of that system,"" says the first page. As with ""Manifold"" these stories explore possible (and significantly linked) states of Earth and the universe, alternate timelines offering different solutions to Baxter's favourite cosmological question--the Fermi Paradox.  It's a simple idea. According to our best scientific theories there's nothing special about Earth or the Solar System. Intelligent life has evolved here--ourselves. It's likely to evolve elsewhere. The skies should be full of other intelligences. Where are they?  Perhaps our theories are wrong and we're in a galactic quarantine. Perhaps what we see through our telescopes is a clever fake--but supposing we overload the capabilities of the fakers? Maybe intelligence always destroys itself before crossing interstellar space, or something kindly takes emerging life away to a safer place. Perhaps there's teeming intelligence out there, but we're not listening on the right wavelength. Perhaps they're hiding...?  Another Baxter theme revisited again in this mind-stretching collection is the high-tech romance of the space programme and walking on the Moon. Alternate histories of space exploration are deftly conjured up, some of them wonderfully paranoid. Yet another theme is deep time--the unthinkable gulf from Big Bang to the final extinction of the universe and possibilities of life at both extremes.  Baxter at his best has a bleakly lyrical view of the remote future, reminiscent of Arthur C Clarke. There are homages to other classics, including Asimov's ""Nightfall"" and even Dante's Divine Comedy whose final vision of paradise takes on a highly unexpected SF meaning. --David LangfordContents:Moon-Calf (1998)Open Loops (2000)Glass Earth, Inc.

In every era, fans have found heroes to cheer, and in part our attachment to the game has been fueled by hotly contested efforts to measure the superstars of the present against the titans of yesteryear. ""Greats of the Game"" fondly contributes to the nostalgic appeal of the national pastime by celebrating, in a subjective, engagingly outspoken text and dazzling, rarely seen photographs, the game's greatest players, teams, managers, games, and colorful personalities. Here are a century's worth of stars and highlights: Babe Ruth and Nolan Ryan, Jackie Robinson and Barry Bonds, Don Larsen's perfect game, Willie Mays's catch of Vic Wertz's 450-foot drive in the 1954 World Series. Ray Robinson, author of the definitive biography of Lou Gehrig, shares more than 70 years of memories, while fellow baseball maven Christopher Jennison describes the stunning photos he has selected, in a lavish, opinionated treasury that is certain to inspire passionate debate.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","To most Americans, baseball is just a sport; but to those who own baseball teams--and those who play on them--our national pastime is much more than a game. In this book, Robert Burk traces the turbulent labor history of American baseball since 1921. His comprehensive, readable account details the many battles between owners and players that irrevocably altered the business of baseball. During what Burk calls baseball's ""paternalistic era,"" from 1921 to the early 1960s, the sport's management rigidly maintained a system of racial segregation, established a network of southern-based farm teams that served as a captive source of cheap replacement labor, and crushed any attempts by players to create collective bargaining institutions. In the 1960s, however, the paternal order crumbled, eroded in part by the civil rights movement and the competition of television. As a consequence, in the ""inflationary era"" that followed, both players and umpires established effective unions that successfully pressed for higher pay, pensions, and greater occupational mobility--and then fought increasingly bitter struggles to hold on to these hard-won gains.",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","After receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor for action in Iraq, Commander Daniel V. Lenson is given new orders: ""Take over as skipper of USS Thomas W. Horn."" His mission: Prepare the Tomahawk-equipped strike destroyer and her crew for the Red Sea, where she'll join an international task force searching for weapons of mass destruction. But this will be no routine deployment. Horn will be the first US Navy warship to deploy with an integrated male and female crew--a controversial and politically explosive experiment that will raise questions about morale, behavior, training, sexual attraction, and ultimately, performance under fire. Facing sandstorms, smugglers, and ambushes, Horn's increasingly polarized crew will conduct demanding, diplomatically sensitive search-and-seizure operations against foreign vessels attempting to smuggle arms to Iraq. But the real nightmare is brewing in Bahrain. There the most dangerous bomb expert in Al-Qaeda has targeted Horn for attack--as the first step in a plan to redraw the map of the whole Middle East. With gripping action scenes and an explosive climax, The Command continues Dan Lenson's star-crossed career in a series that explores both global and deeply personal implications of honor, duty, power, and war.",Paperback,,448 pages,"

From the bestselling author of The Circle, The Med, The Gulf, The Passage, Tomahawk, China Sea, Black Storm, and The Command . . .  a heartstopping thriller of danger and conspiracy at the highest levels of command and government.
Medal of Honor winner Commander Dan Lenson wonders who proposed that he be assigned to the White House military staff. It's a dubious honor---serving a president the Joint Chiefs hate more than any other in modern history.Lenson reports to the West Wing to direct a multiservice team working to interdict the flow of drugs from Latin America.  Never one to just warm a chair, he sets out to help destroy the Cartel---and uncovers a troubling thread of clues that link cunning and ruthless drug lord Don Juan Nuñez to an assault on a nuclear power plant in Mexico, an obscure Islamic relief agency in Los Angeles, and an air cargo company's imminent flight plan across the United States.Lenson has to battle civilian aides and his own distaste for politics to derail a terrorist strike over the Mexican border. His punishment for breaking the rules to do so is to be sent to the East Wing . . .  as the military aide carrying the nuclear ""football,"" the locked briefcase with the secret codes for a nuclear strike, for a president he suspects is having an affair with his wife.And something else is going on beneath the day-to-day turmoil and backstabbing. As his marriage deteriorates and his frustration with Washington builds, Lenson becomes an unwitting accomplice in a dangerous and subversive conspiracy. The U.S. military is responsible for its Commander in Chief's transportation and security. If someone felt strongly enough about it . . . it would be easy for the president to die.",Hardcover,,305 pages,"

","In the third volume of David Poyer's monumental Civil War at Sea cycle, North meets South in the momentous first battle between ironclads.  In Fire on the Waters America split in two and the characters in David Poyer's Civil War at Sea series had to choose sides. Then, in A Country of Our Own, Ker Claiborne took the war north, aboard the Confederacy's most formidable commerce raider.  Now, in That Anvil of Our Souls, David Poyer takes us into the turrets and casemates of the most historic sea engagement of the Civil War. In New York, Theo Hubbard is the engineer for a revolutionary new ""fighting machine,"" the Monitor, and is eager to become a man of means . . . even if it compromises his integrity. In Norfolk, Catherine Claiborne faces her husband's impending hanging for piracy, their baby daughter's death, and the realities of occupation.  In Richmond, Lieutenant Lomax Minter must find a spy who threatens the South's ultimate weapon: a tremendous ironclad, rebuilt from a sunken wreck; aging Dr. Steele witnesses the horrors that are the aftermath of glory; and gun captain Hanks, escaped slave, struggles with the twin snakes of ""freedom.""",Paperback,,432 pages,"

","We first met Lt. Ker Custis Claiborne, formerly of the United States Navy, in Fire on the Waters. Claiborne is no admirer of slavery. But he's a Virginian, joining the fledgling Confederate States Navy in 1861. After fighting along the Potomac with the Army of Virginia, Ker and his mentor, Captain Parker Trezevant, burn, sink, and destroy across the Caribbean to undermine the Union and force a truce favorable to the Confederacy.  But when their first cruiser proves too slow and small, Ker joins Commander James Bullock in London to buy or build a ship of war that can sweep Yankee commerce from the seas. A daring coup puts Ker in command of the most dangerous raider ever to range from Brazil to Boston, but the bloodiest battle is yet to come -- a confrontation between the ex-opium clipper C.S.S. Maryland and the Union cruiser that has trailed her across a quarter of the world.

He does it as much to avoid an arranged marriage to his cousin, Araminta Van Velsor, as to defend the flag.  Eli meets Lieutenant Ker Claiborne aboard the sloop of war U.S.S. Owanee. An Annapolis graduate who's seen action in the West Indies and the Africa Station, Claiborne is cool and competent in storm and battle, but he now faces an agonizing choice between the Navy he loves and his native Virginia. Whichever road he takes, he'll be called a traitor.  With authentic nautical and historical detail, master sea-yarner David Poyer follows Eli, Araminta, Ker, and their loved ones and shipmates into a maelstrom of divided loyalties, bitter partings, stormy seas, governmental panic, political blundering, and, finally, the test of battle as the bloodiest and most divisive war in American history begins.

","Children instinctively love poetry, with its appealing mixture of rhythm and rhyme. And Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, with his suspenseful narrative verse, deceptively simple structure, and powerful images of 19th-century United States, makes an especially suitable subject for the critically acclaimed Poetry for Young People series. Brilliant, specially commissioned artwork brings to life all the atmosphere, drama, and emotion of his writing: the vital energy of ""The Village Blacksmith,"" the urgency of ""Paul Revere's Ride,"" and the sorrow of ""The Wreck of the Hesperus."" An opening essay tells of Longfellow's life: his childhood in Maine, his family history (the Longfellows played a major role in New England politics), his success as a professor of foreign languages, and his often-tragic personal life. More than just a biography, it reveals the inspiration for many of Longfellow's most popular works. Nearly 30 poems appear, most in their entirety, including ""The Arrow and the Song,"" ""The Rainy Day,"" ""Woods in Winter,"" ""The Forest Primeval"" (from ""Evangeline""), ""Hiawatha's Childhood"" (from ""Song of Hiawatha""), ""A Psalm of Life,"" and the abolitionist ""The Witnesses."" As always in this series, supplementary word definitions give children the knowledge they need to fully understand the poems. 48 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 10. ",Hardcover,,48 pages,"

The five have made incredible discoveries about themselves. Amelia is apparently a fourth-dimensional being; Victor is a synthetic man who can control the molecular arrangement of matter; Vanity can find secret passageways through solid walls; Colin is a psychic; Quentin is a warlock. Each power comes from a different paradigm or view of the universe. They have learned to control their strange abilities and have escaped into our world: now their true battle for survival begins.        The Chronicles of Chaos is situated in the literary territory of J.

","Why did big-brained Homo sapiens suddenly emerge some 150,000 years ago? The key, according to Leonard Shlain, is female sexuality. Drawing on an awesome breadth of research, he shows how, long ago, the narrowness of the newly bipedal human female's pelvis and the increasing size of infants' heads precipitated a crisis for the species. Natural selection allowed for the adaptation of the human female to this environmental stress by reconfiguring her hormonal cycles, entraining them with the periodicity of the moon. The results, however, did much more than ensure our existence; they imbued women with the concept of time, and gave them control over sex--a power that males sought to reclaim. And the possibility of achieving immortality through heirs drove men to construct patriarchal cultures that went on to dominate so much of human history.From the nature of courtship to the evolution of language, Shlain's brilliant and wide-ranging exploration stimulates new ways of thinking about very old matters.""A masterpiece of ideas and a unique contribution to our understanding of gender and history, sexuality and evolution."" -- Jean Houston[Note: includes Reader's Guide]",Paperback,1st Penguin Books edition,464 pages,"

","Mi vida, del presidente Clinton, es un impresionante y sorprendentemente honesto retrato de un l’der global que decidi— cuando era joven que dedicar’a sus dotes intelectuales y pol’ticas, y su extraordinaria capacidad para el trabajo duro, al servicio de los ciudadanos.Nos muestra el avance de un americano notable que, gracias a sus enormes energ’as y su esfuerzo, logr— realizar el improbable viaje desde Hope, Arkansas, hasta la Casa Blanca — un trayecto alimentado por su apasionado inter?s en el proceso pol’tico que se manifest— en cada etapa de su vida: en la universidad, trabajando como becario para el senador William Fulbright; en Oxford, cuando form— parte del movimiento de protesta contra la guerra de Vietma; en la facultad de Derecho de Yale, haciendo campa–a a nivel de base para los candidatos dem—cratas; y de nuevo en Arkansas, cuando se present— candidato al Congreso, a fiscal general y al cargo de gobernador.A lo largo de esta obra, somos testigos de c—mo su carrera pol’tica se forj— a partir de su decidida voluntad de mejorar la vida de sus conciudadanos, un compromiso firme con el avance de los derechos civiles, y una excepcional capacidad de comprender los detalles pr‡cticos de la vida pol’tica.Tambi?n llegamos a comprender las presiones emocionales a las que se vio sometido en su juventud, desde su nacimiento tras la temprana muerte de su padre, hasta la d’ficil situaci—n que vivi—, atrapado en una relaci—n disfuncional entre su en?rgica madre que tanto se preocup— de ?l, y un padrastro maltratador al que jam‡s dej— de querer, y cuyo nombre adopt—. Asistimos a la atracci—n que sinti— por la brillante e irresistible Hillary Rodham, con la cual decidi— casarse, y a la apasionada devoci—n, desde su infancia, a su hija Chelsea, as’ como a toda la experiencia de la paternidad. Y tambi?n, c—mo lenta y dolorosamente, empieza a comprender que su temprana negaci—n del dolor en ocasiones le arrastr— a pautas de conducta da–inas.El libro del presidente Clinton es tambi?n la narraci—n m‡s completa, matizada y con m‡s detalles concretos de una presidencia que se ha escrito jam‡s, abarcando no s—lo los momentos m‡s destacados de las crisis sino tambi?n la manera en que la presidencia funciona realmente: el bombardeo cotidiano de problemas, personalidades, conflictos, reveses y ?xitos.Es un testamento acerca del impacto positivo que su labor y sus ideales tuvieron en Estados Unidos y en todo el mundo.Es el emocionante relato de un presidente sometido a un asalto implacable y concertado, orquestado por sus enemigos de la extrema derecha, as’ como la historia de c—mo sobrevivi— y termin— por prevalecer sobre todo ello.Estamos ante un tesoro de momentos capturados en toda su vivacidad, entre ellos:• El ni–o de diez a–os contemplando las convenciones pol’ticas nacionales en el nuevo (y primer) aparato de televisi—n familiar.• El joven candidato en busca de votos por las colinas de Arkansas, y el prof?tico habitante de un pueblo, que le dijo, ÇCualquiera que est? haciendo campa–a en un tugurio en Joiner a medianoche de un s‡bado se merece llevarse la urnaÉ Ganar‡s aqu’. Pero ser‡ el œnico maldito sitio en el que ganes de todo el condadoÈ. (Ten’a raz—n en ambas cosas).• La monta–a rusa que fue la campa–a de 1992.• Las conversaciones extraordinariamente francas con Newt Gingrich y Bob Dole.• La delicada manipulaci—n necesaria para convencer a Rabin y Arafat de que se dieran la mano frente a las c‡maras, a la vez que deb’a evitarse que Arafat besara a Rabin.• El coste, tanto pœblico como privado, del esc‡ndalo que amenaz— a la presidencia.Nos hallamos frente a la vida de una destacada figura nacional e internacional, que nos es revelada con todos sus talentos y contradicciones, contada abiertamente, con su voz personal y reconocible. Un libro excepcional de un americano excepcional.",Paperback,,1152 pages,"

","In this new, updated edition of a book heralded as a clarion call to the nation's conscience, William Bennett asks why we see so little public outrage in the fade of the evidence of deep corruption within Bill Clinton's administration. The Death of Outrage examines the Monica Lewinsky scandal as it unfolded, from Clinton's denials that he had had sex with a young White House intern, to his testimony before the grand jury, to the nation's decision not to remove Clinton from office. Brick by brick, Bennett dismantles the wall of defenses offered by Clinton and his apologists, and casts the clear light of moral reason and common sense on a shameful chapter in American history.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","While white Americans were evenly divided about Bill Clinton’s impeachment ninety percent of African-Americans opposed it. Now from a founding member of the National Association of Black Journalists comes a groundbreaking new book that explores the deep and unique connection between the former president and the black community–in the words of journalists, celebrities, academics, and other thoughtful Americans.Going well beyond mere TV punditry, luminaries such as Dr. Mary Frances Berry, Bill Gray, Kweisi Mfume, and Alice Randall, as well as ordinary citizens, offer insight into why African-Americans for the first time saw themselves in the soul of a president–Whether it was the large African-American presence in his administration, his perceived legal persecutions, his personal style, or his lasting yet tumultuous marriage–and why that kinship has sweeping cultural implications. Bill Clinton’s actions, associations, and essence are all analyzed in light of their effect on and appeal to this crucial constituency.Much-awaited and long overdue, Bill Clinton and Black America features fascinating, provocative interpretations of the special relationship between the black people and this extraordinary man who, when his presidency ended, moved his office from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue–White America’s most famous address–to Harlem’s 125th Street–the heart of Black America.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","As America’s first truly postmodern president, Bill Clinton experienced both great highs and stunning lows in office that will shape the future course of American politics. Clinton will forever be remembered as the first elected president to be impeached, but will his tarnished legacy have lasting effects on America’s political system?Including the conflict in Kosovo, the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, and new developments in the 2000 presidential campaign, The Postmodern Presidency is the most comprehensive and current assessment of Bill Clinton’s presidency available in print.The book examines Clinton’s role in redefining the institution of the presidency, and his affect on future presidents’ economic and foreign policies. The contributors highlight the president’s unprecedented courtship of public opinion; how polls affected policy; how the president gained “celebrity” status; how Clinton’s “postmodern” style of public presidency helped him survive the 1994 elections and impeachment; and how all of this might impact future presidents.This new text also demonstrates how the Clinton presidency changed party politics in the public and in Congress, with long-term implications and costs to both Republicans and his own Democratic party, while analyzing Clinton’s effect on the 1990s “culture wars,” the politics and importance of gender, and the politics and policy of race.",Paperback,,312 pages,"

","The Jews are known for their intuitive genius in getting out of a pickle. With their long history of persecution, they've developed a knack for escaping seemingly hopeless predicaments: when your back is against the wall, you learn to think fast. Centuries of reasoning and interpreting the Holy Scriptures have also contributed to the Jews' skill in solving the most puzzling problems. This astute way of thinking is known in Yiddish as yiddishe kop , literally ""Jewish head."" Through Jewish humor, folklore, and tales of the great rabbis, Rabbi Nilton Bonder presents the basic principles of this creative approach to thinking, which sees beyond appearances to the hidden truth of any problem. Once these are mastered, they may in turn be applied to many ""impossible"" situations that arise in business and in life. The book focuses on four levels of solving a problem:    1.  On the level of Information, we approach problems literally, in response to the obvious and the concrete.    2.  On the level of Understanding, we obtain concealed information through techniques such as questioning, reframing, and emptying the mind.    3.  On the level of Wisdom, we access the world of intuition, where a ""fool"" can achieve the impossible by relying on feelings, premonitions, dreams, and coincidences.    4.  On the level of Reverence, we discover the hidden Reality behind appearances. This is the realm of those who dare to take risks, make commitments, and learn from mistakes, who act out of their living experience without relying solely on reason and conceptual thinking.",Paperback,,112 pages,"

","Rabbi Bonder turns a few conventional religious ideas on their heads as he examines the Bible and other Jewish teachings to identify the forces at play in individual, social, and spiritual transformation. Religious conformists believe that obeying the established moral order will lead to the salvation of our souls. On the contrary, says Bonder, the human spirit is nourished by what society labels immoral. Even the Bible legitimizes the notion that we have a God-given urge to rebel against the status quo in order to evolve, grow, and ascend. It is this ""immoral"" soul of ours that impels us to do battle with God--and out of this clash, Bonder predicts, a new humanity will emerge. In the course of discussion, the author examines a variety of intriguing issues touching on religion, science, and culture, including the teachings of evolutionary psychology; the relation of body and soul; infidelity in marriage; anti-Semitism and the Jew as traitor; transgression, sacrifice, and redemption in Judaism and Christianity; and the Messiah as archetypal transgressor.",Hardcover,,128 pages,"

","Nar�yana's best-seller gives its reader much more than ""Friendly Advice."" In one handy collection--closely related to the world-famous Pa�catantra or Five Discourses on Worldly Wisdom --numerous animal fables are interwoven with human stories, all designed to instruct wayward princes. Tales of canny procuresses compete with those of cunning crows and tigers. An intrusive ass is simply thrashed by his master, but the meddlesome monkey ends up with his testicles crushed. One prince manages to enjoy himself with a merchant's wife with her husband's consent, while another is kicked out of paradise by a painted image. This volume also contains the compact version of King Víkrama's Adventures, thirty-two popular tales about a generous emperor, told by thirty-two statuettes adorning his lion-throne.Co-published by New York University Press and the JJC FoundationFor more on this title and other titles in the Clay Sanskrit series, please visit http: //www.claysanskritlibrary.org",Hardcover,,737 pages,"

","Nyle's life with her grandmother on their Vermont sheep farm advances rhythmically through the seasons until the night of the accident at the Cookshire nuclear power plant. Without warning, Nyle's modest world fills with protective masks, evacuations, contaminated food, disruptions, and mistrust.Nyle adjusts to the changes. As long as the fallout continues blowing to the East, Nyle, Gran, and the farm can go on. But into this uncertain haven stumble Ezra Trent and his mother, ""refugees"" from the heart of the accident, who take temporary shelter in the back bedroom of Nyle's house.The back bedroom is the dying room: It took her mother when Nyle was six; it stole away her grandfather just two years ago. Now Ezra is back there and Nyle doesn't want to open her heart to him. Too many times she's let people in, only to have them desert her.Karen Hesse's voice and vision are grounded in truth; she takes on a nearly unharnessable subject, contains it, and makes it resonate with honesty. Part love story, part coming of age, this is a tour de force by a gifted writer.",Paperback,,192 pages,"

","In When Hollywood Had a King, the distinguished journalist Connie Bruck tells the sweeping story of MCA and its brilliant leader, a man who transformed the entertainment industry— businessman, politician, tactician, and visionary Lew Wasserman. The Music Corporation of America was founded in Chicago in 1924 by Dr. Jules Stein, an ophthalmologist with a gift for booking bands. Twelve years later, Stein moved his operations west to Beverly Hills and hired Lew Wasserman. From his meager beginnings as a movie-theater usher in Cleveland, Wasserman ultimately ascended to the post of president of MCA, and the company became the most powerful force in Hollywood, regarded with a mixture of fear and awe. In his signature black suit and black knit tie, Was-serman took Hollywood by storm. He shifted the balance of power from the studios—which had seven-year contractual strangleholds on the stars—to the talent, who became profit partners. When an antitrust suit forced MCA’s evolution from talent agency to film- and television-production company, it was Wasserman who parlayed the control of a wide variety of entertainment and media products into a new type of Hollywood power base. There was only Washington left to conquer, and conquer it Wasserman did, quietly brokering alliances with Democratic and Republican administrations alike. That Wasserman’s reach extended from the underworld to the White House only added to his mystique. Among his friends were Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, mob lawyer Sidney Korshak, and gangster Moe Dalitz—along with Presidents Johnson, Clinton, and especially Reagan, who enjoyed a particularly close and mutually beneficial relationship with Wasserman. He was equally intimate with Hollywood royalty, from Bette Davis and Jimmy Stewart to Steven Spielberg, who began his career at MCA and once described Wasserman’s eyeglasses as looking like two giant movie screens.The history of MCA is really the history of a revolution. Lew Wasserman ushered in the Hollywood we know today. He is the link between the old-school moguls with their ironclad studio contracts and the new industry defined by multimedia conglomerates, power agents, multimillionaire actors, and profit sharing. In the hands of Connie Bruck, the story of Lew Wasserman’s rise to power takes on an almost Shakespearean scope. When Hollywood Had a King reveals the industry’s greatest untold story: how a stealthy, enterprising power broker became, for a time, Tinseltown’s absolute monarch.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,528 pages,"

","During the 1980s, Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham Lambert was the Billionaire Junk Bond King. He invented such things as ""the highly confident letter"" (I'm highly confident that I can raise the money you need to buy company X) and ""the blind pool"" (Here's a billion dollars: let us help you buy a company), and he financed the biggest corporate raiders--men like Carl Icahn and Ronald Perelman.And then, on September 7, 1988, things changed. The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert with insider trading and stock fraud. Waiting in the wings was the US District Attorney, who wanted to file criminal and racketeering charges. What motivated Milken in his drive for power and money? Did Drexel Burnham Lambert condone the breaking of laws? The Predators' Ball dramatically captures American business history in the making, uncovering the philosophy of greed that has dominated Wall Street in the 1980s.",Paperback,,400 pages,"

","As Lippard points out, Hesse's use of obsessive repetition in her works served to increase and exaggerate the absurdity she saw in her life. In many ways, her works were ”psychic models,” as Robert Smithson has said, of ”a very interior person.” In pioneering the use of ”soft” materials, her sculptures betrayed her awareness of the manner in which her experience as a woman altered her art and career. Although she died before feminism affected the art world to any great extent, her major works have since become talismans for succeeding generations of women artists. Eva Hesse was designed by Hesse's friends and colleagues Sol LeWitt and Pat Stier; her sculptures, drawings, and paintings are reproduced and discussed; and the text includes numerous quotations from her diaries. First published in 1976 but long out-of-print, this classic text is both an insightful critical analysis and a tribute to an artist whose genius has become increasingly apparent with the passage of time.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","On May 2, 1919, Hesse wrote to Romain Rolland: ""I have had to bear a very heavy burden in my personal life in recent years. Now I am about to go to Ticino once again, to live for a while as a hermit in nature and in my work."" In 1920, after settling in the Ticino mountain village of Montagnola, he published Wandering, a love letter to this magic-garden world that can be read as a meditation on his attempt to begin a new life. His pure prose, his heartfelt lyricism, and his love for the old earth, for its blessings that renew themselves, all sing in this serene book. The first German edition of Wandering included facsimiles of fourteen watercolor landscapes. Hesse's painting had blossomed in the southern countryside and he even toyed with the idea ""that I might still succeed in escaping literature entirely and making a living at the more appealing trade of painter."" Unfortunately, his original pictures for Wandering have disappeared; this edition reproduces in black-and-white the full-color reproductions of the 1920 edition.",Hardcover,,119 pages,"

","'Narciso y Goldmundo' (originalmente, en alemán, 'Narziß und Goldmund') es una novela del premio nobel alemán Hermann Hesse, escrita en 1930.Se trata de una novela de ""conciliación"" de antagonismos. Los dos personajes protagónicos de la misma, Narciso y Goldmundo, siguen, cada uno, sus propios caminos, atraviesan —el uno y el otro— innumerables desventuras y descubrimientos. Sus puntos de vista respectivos sobre el mundo, sus cosmovisiones, bosquejan en el inicio trayectorias marcadamente divergentes, para reencontrarse, después en lo esencial, hacia el final de la obra.La reconciliación es propuesta, hacia el desenlace, por el novelista. Lo que se ve de hecho es que ambos personajes no han dejado de pensar emocionadamente, el uno en el otro, a lo largo de toda la vida. A pesar de las diferencias de enfoque, de objetivos, de menesteres que los han atareado. Hesse buscará conjugar a su manera sin quebrantarlo, un dualismo manifiesto entre espíritu y materia, entre espiritualidad y animalidad, o entre la vocación y la mirada de las ciencias y la de las artes.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++First published in 1930, Narcissus and Goldmund is the story of two diametrically opposite men: one, an ascetic monk firm in his religious commitment, and the other, a romantic youth hungry for worldly experience.Hesse was a great writer in precisely the modern sense: complex, subtle, allusive: alive to the importance of play. Narcissus and Goldmund is his very best. What makes this short book so limitlessly vast is the body-and-soul-shaking debate that runs through it, which it has the honesty and courage not to resolve: between the flesh and spirit, art and scientific or religious speculation, action and contemplation.",Paperback,,287 pages,"

","Acclaimed not only for its ""grace, skill and erudition,"" (The Washington Post) but also for its warm, engaging narrative, Thomas Cahill's Hinges of History series humanized the history of both the Jewish and the Irish people. In Pope John XXIII, he combines his remarkable insight and knowledge to portray this legendary and beloved pontiff.  Pope John XXIII opens with a concise but sweeping history of the Catholic Church and the papacy, culminating in the brief but unforgettable reign of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli as Pope John XXIII, in the mid-twentieth century. At seventy-six years of age, neither an intellectual nor a highly trained theologian, he was at first regarded as a transitional pope. During his reign, however, he awed the world with the seminal and unprecedented change he brought about in his concern for the fundamental plight of humankind.  In rich, impassioned prose, Cahill follows Roncalli's life from his peasant roots to his landmark Second Vatican Council, with its emphasis on worldwide social justice, which marked the beginning of a true shift in the Catholic Church and its relationship to the modern world. In a biography that will captivate Catholics and non-Catholics alike, Cahill's signature blend of interpretive insight and scholarship mirrors Pope John's own intuition, spontaneity, and all-embracing vision.",Hardcover,,176 pages,"

But it is also a poetry that insists on angry intelligence over world-weary head-shaking"". -- Publishers Weekly. For a poet to be collected like this, at the age of fifty in mid-career, is unusual, but not for Reading -- prolific, distinctive and controversial.

","""This is easily the finest collection of essays in the philosophy of language assembled for students, for undergaduate or graduate students. There is not even a close second competitor."" -- Ernie Lepore, Associate Director, Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS), Rutgers University ""This is easily the best anthology in the philosophy of language; it is certain to become the standard textbook for years to come"" -- Stephen Neale, Professor of Philosophy, Birkbeck College, University of London, and the University of California, Berkeley. Throughout the history of ideas, various branches of philosophy have spun off into the natural sciences, including physics, biology, and perhaps most recently, cognitive psychology. A central theme of this collection is that the philosophy of language, at least a core portion of it, has matured to the point where it is now being spun off into linguistic theory. Each section of the book contains historical (twentieth-century) readings and, where available, recent attempts to apply the resources of contemporary linguistic theory to the problems under discussion. This approach helps to root the naturalization project in the leading questions of analytic philosophy. Although the older readings predate the current naturalization project, they help to lay its conceptual foundations. The main sections of the book, each of which is preceded by an introduction, are Language and Meaning, Logical Form and Grammatical Form, Descriptions, Names, Demonstratives, and Attitude Reports.The collection is not intended as a final report on a mature line of philosophical inquiry. Rather, its purpose is to show students whatdoing real philosophy is all about and to let them share in the excitement as philosophers enter a period in which how philosophy of language is conducted could change in fundamental ways.",Paperback,,1091 pages,"

","Peter Reading is one of Britain's most prolific, versatile, startlingly contemporary, and strikingly original poets. Employing increasingly ingenious metrical skills, Reading maps out an inconsolably sad and, at times, hilariously funny picture of England -- and the world -- in decline. Tackling issues such as violence, illness, madness, homelessness, and environmental catastrophe, his eschatological vision chastises a world gone morally, ecologically, and politically insane. Both bleak and deeply humane, his harrowing art aspires to, nothing less than, a distilled elegiac epic of our time. The destruction also strikes at Reading's art itself -- the last six books are one long valedictory, culminating in his own death statement, Ob.Reading Peter Reading illuminates the poet's thematic and formal concerns, paradoxes, and development, as well as underlining his major status in contemporary literature. Its updated, detailed, textual analysis will help the readers' understanding of the poetry and provide a thorough and substantial basis for any future critical discussion of Reading's work.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

This approach is presented in the text by these underlying concepts: (1) print is two-way communication; (2) reading is the flip side of writing; and (3) good readers can train themselves to follow the writerAEs path when they read.""",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Fourth-graders around the country face new, high-stakes standardized tests, drawing increased attention to the need for effective literacy instruction in the upper-elementary grades. This essential book goes beyond political catch-phrases to examine what actually works in the fourth-grade classroom. After reviewing current research on upper-elementary reading instruction, the book takes readers directly into the classrooms of six highly successful teachers. Like the previously published Learning to Read, which focused on the first grade, Reading to Learn offers a rare view of the techniques and strategies good teachers use to engage students, help them develop as thoughtful readers and writers, and bolster self-directed learning and literate conversation. Bringing to life the complexities of day-to-day work with diverse students, the book provides inspiration and practical ideas for any teacher in the upper-elementary grades.",Paperback,,254 pages,"

","Ways with Words presents interpretive essays by scholars from different disciplines on seven core, premodern classical Chinese texts. The remarkable diversity of these works--drawn from literature, philosophy, religion, and art history--challenges the presumption of a monolithic Chinese tradition that has been promoted by scholars and popular culture alike, both in China and the West. The texts themselves include a poem from the Classic of Poetry compiled in the sixth century b.c.e.; passages from Mencius and Zhuangzi; the Heart Sutra; a poem by Du Fu and the Biography of Yingying by Yuan Zhen, both written during the Tang dynasty; and Notes on the Method for the Brush, a tenth-century text attributed to Jing Hao. Both the original Chinese versions and the translations are provided for each primary text. There are at least two essays--when possible from scholars in different fields--on each work. The volume as a whole demonstrates the various ways in which the modern Western reader can confront the impressive variety of texts from the classical Chinese tradition.",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","The films of Hitchcock, Welles and Godard; the aesthetics of photography and the technology of cinema; art and revolution in Russia and in Mexico; the avant-gardes in film and in painting—these are among the many topics of Peter Wollen’s essays. Interwoven with fictional treatments of such themes as memory, dream, sexuality and writing, they compose a remarkable, perhaps unique, volume.These “readings and writings” are informed by Marxism, semiotics, psychoanalysis, and the history of art itself. Their concern is with signification: with the ways in which meanings are produced in dominant art forms and with the counter-strategies by which these meanings may be questioned or dislodged, in the practice of politically and aesthetically radical alternatives. A concluding retrospect reviews the political, intellectual and aesthetic avant-garde currents of the fifteen years over which these texts were written, outlining some perspectives for oppositional art today.",Paperback,,228 pages,"

For twenty-five years Peter Reading has been one of Britain's most original and controversial poets: angry, uncompromising, gruesomely ironic, hilarious and heart-breaking -- as funny as he is disconcerting. He is probably the most skillful and technically inventive poet writing today, mixing the matter and speech of the gutter with highly sophisticated metrical and syllabic patterns to produce scathing and grotesque accounts of lives blighted by greed, meanness, ignorance, political ineptness, and cultural impoverishment.",Paperback,,318 pages,"

","Boston real estate agent William Collins knows that his habits are slipping out of control. Due to obsessive-compulsive daily cleaning binges and a penchant for nightly online cruising for hookups, he finds his sales figures slipping despite a booming market. There's also his ongoing struggle to collect the rent from his passive-aggressive tenant and his worries about his best friend, Edward, whom he's certainly not in love with. Just as he decides to do something about his life, he meets Charlotte and Samuel, wealthy suburbanites looking for the perfect city apartment. ""Happy couple,"" he writes in his notes. ""Maybe I can learn something from them."" What he ultimately discovers challenges his own assumptions about real estate, love, and desire; and what they learn from him might unravel a budding friendship, not to mention a very promising sale.  Full of crackling dialogue delivered by a stellar ensemble of players, Alternatives to Sex is a smart, hilarious chronicle of life in post-traumatic, morally ambiguous America -- where the desire to do good is constantly being tripped up by the need to feel good.

","Lust brings out the liar in everyone. Every erection has Pinocchio written up and down its length—yes, everybody wants to be REAL, a real boy, an honest woman, unafraid and upright—but then desire, the ultimate honesty, does us in. Desire doesn't give a whit about shame. Our secrets, our exaggerations and distractions, it's all just a lot of twisting in the wind as far as sex is concerned—what we want WILL come out. ""Is our sexuality a basic, good, and precious thing that somehow became terribly misunderstood? Or is there something really evil out there in Sex Land that attaches itself to our libidos and is only held back by vigilance and caution?"" asks Susie Bright in her bestselling book The Sexual State of the Union. Bright pushes the borders of propriety until they blur and become irrelevant in the face of our inherent need to touch and be touched. With candor and passion, Susie Bright proves that sexual knowledge can indeed be salvation and inspiration.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Susie Bright has gained a reputation as one of the world's leading writers on sex and sexual politics. Bright's stories in magazines like Salon, Playboy, and Bust have drawn cultish followings, and her books are national bestsellers. Mommy's Little Girl contains selected writing since the birth of Bright's now twelve-year-old daughter, Aretha. Challenging the idea that a woman cannot be a mother and sex goddess at the same time, this book positions Bright as a beacon of hope for women who feel that their days of openness about their sexuality must come to an end after they have a child. Bright describes how her daughter and her classmates have made her aware of how sexually charged children are these days, yet dangerously lack a proper education about their own bodies. From reminiscing on her role as ""lesbian consultant"" to the directors of The Matrix to her hilarious instruction for both men and women on how to ruin their sex lives in twelve easy steps, Bright's always provocative, often hilarious prose is sure to appeal to anyone with a heartbeat, and tops it off with the perfect end to perfect sex — a recipe for lustful cherry pie!",Paperback,,172 pages,"

Susie Bright Presents: Three the Hard Way
 Erotic Novellas by William Harrison, Greg Boyd, and Tsaurah Litzky   Pull down the shades and settle in for pleasure with this trio of erotic novellas -- handpicked by Susie Bright -- showcasing stories that are hot and masterful.  Susie Bright, hailed by The New York Times as ""the avatar of American erotica,"" is the undisputed grandmaster of the genre. Now she has handpicked three rising stars -- new masters -- whose stories will delight, arouse, and captivate you.  Connected by a central theme -- the idea that one sexual moment can change a person forever -- each story is wildly different from anything you have read before.  In ""Shadow of a Man,"" Emmy Award-winning writer William Harrison takes us to South Africa, where a photographer who thinks he's seen -- and done -- it all begins an intense affair with the daughter of a famous general. ""The Motion of the Ocean"" is Tsaurah Litzky's undaunted story about a woman's coming-of-age from her adolescence in the 1960s to the over-the-top sexuality of the 1990s. Greg Boyd's ""The Widow"" is about the consequences that transpire when a husband reads an erotic novel that his wife has been writing in secret. In it, she has fantasized the outrageous sexual experiences of a widow.  Sensual, provocative, funny, and profound, Three the Hard Way is a pleasure trove of great finds discovered by America's most trusted name in erotica.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The preeminent political essayist writes about the perversion of America's democratic legacy under George W. Bush—and makes a compelling case for impeachment.Lewis Lapham stands virtually alone among mainstream American journalists in having consistently seen through the fog of lies and narcissism surrounding the Bush administration from its earliest days in Washington. Pretensions to Empire brings together Lapham's trenchant political commentaries from his award-winning ""Notebook"" column in Harper's, giving us a complete picture of a presidency whose brazen abuses of power—and incompetence—have led the United States down a precipitous path, culminating in Lapham's eloquent case for impeachment.From a perspective deeply informed by history, Lapham's essays measure the current political moment against a backdrop of past events. Whether discussing the failure of the Bush administration's imperial project in Iraq, its shameless servitude to the country's corporate and religious minority and equally shameful ineptitude in responding to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, or the disturbing revelations of illegal domestic spying authorized by the president himself, Lapham perceives in George W. Bush and his allies a fundamental betrayal of the nation's democratic heritage.Written with the clarity of thought and elegance of prose that have become Lapham's signature style over the years, Pretensions to Empire is a brilliant and provocative work of political reportage.",Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Warum Nick Hornby seinen neuen Roman About a Boy genannt hat, ist eigentlich am Ende der Lektüre nicht ganz klar, denn eigentlich beschreibt er zwei Jungs. Der eine, Will, ist zwar schon 35 Jahre alt und Marcus erst 12. Doch Will ist in seiner Art, sich vor Verantwortung zu drücken und andere für seine Zwecke zu benutzen kaum älter als Marcus. Wie die beiden sich fanden und warum sie sich wunderbar ergänzen, erzählt Nick Hornby in einer rasanten Geschichte. Will hat es nicht nötig zu arbeiten, er kann ganz gut von den geerbten Tantiemen seines Vaters leben und mit festen Freundschaften zu Frauen oder gar die Gründung einer Familie hat er herzlich wenig am Hut. Am meisten haßt er es, wenn wieder einmal eine Beziehung tränenreich zu Ende geht. Bis er auf einen genialen Einfall kommt. Er müßte sich einfach um die schmählich vernachlässigten, alleinerziehenden Frauen kümmern. Es muß Tausende von ihnen überall in London geben, -- ""alleinerziehende Mütter, intelligente, attraktive, willige Frauen"", die ""tollen Sex, reichlich Streicheleinheiten fürs Ego, Vaterschaft auf Zeit ohne Tränen und eine Trennung ohne Schuldgefühle -- was konnte ein Mann sich Besseres wünschen?"" So beginnt Nicks Karriere als Seriensoftie. In seiner Rolle als Will, der Erlöser, trifft er Marcus und seine Mutter. Sie gefällt ihm auf Anhieb ganz gut, doch Marcus ist ganz und gar nicht der Zwölfjährige, wie ihn sich Will vorgestellt hat. Sein Musikgeschmack ist bei Joni Mitchell stehen geblieben, von Curt Cobain hat er keine Ahnung, er trägt die völlig verkehrten Schuhe, von Turnschuhen hat er noch nicht gehört, und vor allem nicht davon, daß es darum geht, die Richtigen zu tragen. Sein Haarschnitt ist eher schlicht und von seinen Hosen ganz zu Schweigen. Für Marcus ist das Leben in seiner Klasse, wie man sich vorstellen kann, nicht ganz leicht. Und nachdem er sich auch noch in das schönste Mädchen der Schule verliebt hat, muß ihm Will schleunigst auf die Sprünge helfen. Sonst wird da nichts Vernünftiges draus. Die Mutter von Marcus ist zwar attraktiv, doch in einer depressiven Stimmung unternimmt sie einen Selbstmordversuch. Ehe er sich versieht hat Will plötzlich, nachdem er wirklich nur an gutem Sex und etwas Unterhaltung interessiert war, eine ganz Menge Probleme am Hals, die sich nicht einfach ignorieren lassen, wenn er sich nur lange genug nicht rührt. About A Boy handelt vom Erwachsenwerden zweier ganz unterschiedlicher Männer. Ihre Schwierigkeiten dabei schildert der Engländer Nick Hornby, der schon mit High Fidelity und Fever Pich -- Ballfieber große Erfolge gelandet hat, in einem unangestrengten, schnodderigen Ton. Er geht sein Thema locker an, doch immer wieder werden seine beiden Helden vom Ernst des Alltags eingeholt. Mitten in der schönsten Slapstick-Einlage bleibt dabei dem Leser das Lachen im Halse stecken. Gut geschriebene Unterhaltung. --Manuela Haselberger",Paperback,,320 pages,"

From beside me a voice said in Arabic, 'Shall we pray, brother?' A guard came and screamed in my ear, 'Shut up, motherfucker, if you speak again I'll kill you.'""--from Enemy CombatantGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, has become a worldwide symbol of the dark side of America's War on Terror. Here, for the first time, is a powerful and moving story from the other side, the first detainee's account of life inside the notorious prison. A highly educated British Muslim, Moazzam Begg spent three years in U.S. custody, nearly two of them in Guantanamo, before being released without charge in January of 2005. Enemy Combatant, written with respected UK journalist Victoria Brittain, is the wrenching narrative of Begg's detention, including his eighteen months in solitary confinement. Secretly abducted at midnight from his home in Afghanistan, held incommunicado in Kandahar and Bagram Air Force base, Begg was eventually flown to Guantanamo, where, like more than 800 Muslim men and boys--550 of whom remain in custody--he was held in shackles and the now-trademark orange prison uniform, subjected to relentless interrogations and abusive and degrading conditions.A riveting, personal story by a thoughtful and eloquent man, Enemy Combatant is a uniquely personal indictment of America's establishment of a global gulag that flouts the Geneva conventions--one of the great miscarriages ofjustice in our time.",Hardcover,,397 pages,"

","This unique ring-bound book provides a reproduction of the important new Defense Department document, the Manual for Military Commissions released by Defense Secretary Gates in January 2007. It contains important Defense Department rules for the prosecution of alien unlawful enemy combatants, rules of evidence, crimes, and elements. Executive Summary - January 18, 2007 - Today, the Secretary of Defense is submitting to Congress a comprehensive Manual for the full and fair prosecution of alien unlawful enemy combatants by military commissions, in accordance with the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The Manual is made up of four separate sections: The Preamble, The Rules for Military Commissions, the Military Commission Rules of Evidence, and the Crimes and Elements. The Rules for Military Commissions set forth the procedural rules for Military Commissions. The Military Commission Rules of Evidence provide evidentiary rules to govern the admissibility of evidence at trial. The Crimes and Elements section lays out the crimes punishable by Military Commission and the elements of those crimes. This Manual is the product of a tremendous interagency effort. Principally military judge advocates and attorneys from the Departments of Defense and Justice, using the Manual for Courts-Martial as a guide, undertook the initial drafting. Drafts were then coordinated with other relevant agencies to ensure that specific rules and procedures reflect careful consideration of our nation's intelligence activities, as called for in the MCA. The overriding considerations reflected in the Manual for Military Commissions are fairness and fidelity to the Military Commissions Act of 2006. It is intended to ensure that alien unlawful enemy combatants who are suspected of war crimes and certain other offenses are prosecuted before regularly constituted courts affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized people. This Manual will have an historic imp",Ring-bound,,237 pages,"

","In response to the events of September 11, 2001, George W. Bush issued a military order that for the first time in US history permits the government to hold and prosecute by military commission stateless members of an organization in an undeclared war, says Cutler (public law, Siena College, Loudonville, New York). After reviewing the history of military commissions, he discusses their current implementation from such perspectives as al-Qaida and the law of partial war, procedures and fundamental fairness issues after 9/11, enemy combatants and the rule of law, the US Supreme Court review of enemy combatants, and balancing civil liberties with national security policy.

","On May 30, 1961, a hail of bullets ended the life of Generalissimo Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, known to his countrymen as ""The Goat"" for his many revolting excesses, after thirty-one years of brutal rule over the Dominican Republic. This book is a riveting, minute-by-minute account of the plot to kill Trujillo, who was then the Western Hemisphere's most ruthless dictator, and the ferocious wave of revenge that ensued before his regime collapsed. The book also reveals the vacillating role of the United States -- and the CIA -- in first propping up the dictator, and then supplying weapons to slay him. Bernard Diederich knew most of those involved in the plot, and painstakingly recreates the events in a gripping book that reads like a novel, which also offers essential insights into the history of a troubled Caribbean nation.",Paperback,,286 pages,"

","In the town of Trujillo, in Honduras, on the edge of the Mosquito Coast, Dr. Arturo Ochoa, a semi-retired psychiatrist, has a single patient: a troubled young man named Thomas Stearns, the son of a wealthy Atlanta family. Stearns has been found adrift on the Carribean in a vessel owned by two Nicaraguans, both of whom are missing; he has been alone for eighteen days and has little memory of that time. Suspected of murder, Stearns is unconcerned. He knows his family will buy off the police. But he is reluctant to leave Trujillo, having developed an odd affinity for the town. As therapy progresses, he tells of a mysterious stone figure regurgitated by, improbably, a whirlpool, and Dr. Ochoa, drawn into his pathology, begins to doubt not only Stearns' sanity, but his own.Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.

Grace is a young Dubliner who works on a television show called Love Quiz. Her father is going benignly senile, but her life otherwise seems fairly solid. When Stephen arrives on her doorstep, however, Grace has no idea what she's in for. Stephen explains that he is an angel, a former bridge builder who committed suicide in 1934. He has been sent back to earth (as all suicides are) to guide lost souls. Grace does not take this personally at first, but eventually she has to face the idea that things are not so easy, and that her greatest intimacy is with this supernatural creature. As Grace begins to take stock of her life and the prospect of caring enough about something to fight for it, The Wig My Father Wore takes us on a moving, surreal romp through Catholicism, parents, and the reclamation of love from the twin modern evils of cynicism and the detritus of pop culture.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Anyone who loves France (or just feels strongly about it), or has succumbed to the spell of Julian Barnes’s previous books, will be enraptured by this collection of essays on the country and its culture.Barnes’s appreciation extends from France’s vanishing peasantry to its hyper-literate pop singers, from the gleeful iconoclasm of nouvelle vague cinema to the orgy of drugs and suffering that is the Tour de France. Above all, Barnes is an unparalleled connoisseur of French writing and writers. Here are the prolific and priapic Simenon, Baudelaire, Sand and Sartre, and several dazzling excursions on the prickly genius of Flaubert. Lively yet discriminating in its enthusiasm, seemingly infinite in its range of reference, and written in prose as stylish as haute couture, Something to Declare is an unadulterated joy.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

The Odds follows the lives of these three professional gamblers through a college basketball season in a one-of-a-kind city struggling to reconcile its lawless past with its family-friendly makeover. With a wiseguy attitude and a faultless eye and ear for the sights and sounds of Vegas and its denizens, Chad Millman has created a portrait that the Wall Street Journal called ""fascinating. . . often screamingly funny.""

","One hundred years ago, in July 1916, an act of terrorism in New York Harbor changed the world.""A gripping account of conspiracy.""--New York Times""A ready-made suspense thriller.""--Boston Globe""Exhaustively researched... fascinating.""--Entertainment Weekly, 50 Hot Summer BooksThe attack in New York Harbor was so explosive that people as far away as Maryland felt the ground shake. Windows were blown out uptown at the New York Public Library; the main building at Ellis Island was nearly destroyed; Statue of Liberty was torn into by shrapnel from the explosion, which would have measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. Chaos overtook Manhattan as the midnight sky turned to fire, lit up with exploding ammunition. The year was 1916. And it had been shockingly easy.While war raged in Europe, Americans watched from afar, unthreatened by the danger overseas. Yet the United States was riddled with networks of German spies hiding in plain sight. The attack on New York Harbor was only one part of their plans: secret anthrax facilities were located just ten miles from the White House; bombs were planted on ships, hidden in buildings, and mailed to the country's civic and business leaders; and an underground syndicate helped potential terrorists obtain fake IDs, housing, and money. President Woodrow Wilson knew an attack of this magnitude was possible, and yet nothing was done to stop it. Americans, feeling buffered by miles of ocean and burgeoning prosperity, had ignored the mounting threat. That all changed on a warm summer evening in late July, when the island in New York Harbor called Black Tom exploded, setting alight a vast store of munitions destined for the front.Three American lawyers--John McCloy, Amos Peaslee, and Harold Martin--made it their mission to solve the Black Tom mystery. Their hunt for justice would take them undercover to Europe, deep into the shadowy world of secret agents and double-crosses, through the halls of Washington and the capitals of Europe. It would challenge their beliefs in right and wrong. And they would discover a sinister plot so vast it could hardly have been imagined--a conspiracy that stretched from downtown Manhattan to the very heart of Berlin.The Detonators is the first full accounting of a crime and a cover-up that resonate strongly in a post-9/11 America. And much of the atmosphere and rhetoric in play 100 years ago remains eerily similar to discussions surrounding national security and immigration today. As Millman deftly illustrates in THE DETONATORS, an island may have disappeared, but the resulting lessons have only grown stronger and more urgent, and history has a persistent way of stirring up its ghosts. This is their story.",Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","The history of blacktop basketball in fast-paced words and pictures. A New York street hustler. A lonely man in a Maryland prison. A confused Native American on a reservation in Idaho. What do they all have in common? They are among the best pickup basketball players in the country. In Pickup Artists, Lars Anderson and Chad Millman tell the complete story of the street game from its mythical past to its glorious present. Using original reporting to examine the evolution of playground basketball, Anderson and Millman are the first journalists to unravel the thickly woven tapestry of the sport’s subculture. Today’s super-hyped, corporate-sponsored tournaments weren’t always the norm. The foundation of the game was laid with sweat in the 1920s and it has grown from a rudimentary sport to a sophisticated exhibition. Basketball is more than macho melodramas acted out in America’s inner cities. It’s a town meeting in the heart of Indiana and symbol of freedom for prisoners in jail. Anderson and Millman tap into the essence of pickup basketball, examining its importance everywhere the game is played. They profile not just legends like Earl Marigault and Joe Hammond, but players like Fred “Spook” Stegman, the man who carries the legacy of being the first to connect the playgrounds with colleges, and Gregory Vaughn, whose tragic death in the 1980s exposed the underground world of drugs in basketball. Forget about the NBA and showtime. Pickup basketball is about basketball on the blacktops, at its most basic level. It’s about the unusual lives of some of the nation’s best players you’ve never heard of. Until now.",Paperback,,214 pages,"

","The true story of the NFL's oldest rookie In 1976, Vince Papale was thirty, a former schoolteacher and part-time bartender, and a season ticket-holder for his beloved Philadelphia Eagles. When he heard that Coach Dick Vermeil was holding open tryouts, he decided to give it a shot. Shocking himself and the coaches, he ran an explosive 40-yard-dash in just 4.5 seconds--a world-class time--and was offered a contract on the spot. When he joined the team, Papale became the oldest non-kicking rookie in NFL history, a fan favorite who played for four years and was named a team captain. Invincible is Vince Papale's story, and a tie-in to the Disney Pictures film of the same name starring Mark Wahlberg as Papale and Greg Kinnear as Vermeil. But more than just a tie-in, it tells Papale's story in his own words, covering subjects not included in the film.

","From one of our most distinguished historians, an authoritative and vivid account of the devastating World War I battle that claimed more than 300,000 livesAt 7:30 am on July 1, 1916, the first Allied soldiers climbed out of their trenches along the Somme River in France and charged out into no-man's-land toward the barbed wire and machine guns at the German front lines. By the end of this first day of the Allied attack, the British army alone would lose 20,000 men; in the coming months, the fifteen-mile-long territory along the river would erupt into the epicenter of the Great War. The Somme would mark a turning point in both the war and military history, as soldiers saw the first appearance of tanks on the battlefield, the emergence of the air war as a devastating and decisive factor in battle, and more than one million casualties (among them a young Adolf Hitler, who took a fragment in the leg). In just 138 days, 310,000 men died.In this vivid, deeply researched account of one history's most destructive battles, historian Martin Gilbert tracks the Battle of the Somme through the experiences of footsoldiers (known to the British as the PBI, for Poor Bloody Infantry), generals, and everyone in between. Interwoven with photographs, journal entries, original maps, and documents from every stage and level of planning, The Somme is the most authoritative and affecting account of this bloody turning point in the Great War.",Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","By drawing on a very large number of German sources, many of them previously unpublished, Jack Sheldon throws new light on a familiar story. In an account filled with graphic descriptions of life and death in the trenches, the author demonstrates that the dreadful losses of 1st July were a direct consequence of meticulous German planning and preparation. Although the Battle of the Somme was frequently a close-run affair, poor Allied co-ordination and persistence in attacking weakly on narrow fronts played into the hands of the German commanders, who were able to rush forward reserves, maintain the overall integrity of their defenses and so continue a successful delaying battle until the onset of winter ultimately neutralized the considerable Allied superiority in men and material.

","A joint operation between Britain and France in 1916, the battle of the Somme was an attempt to gain territory and dent Germany's military strength. By the end of the action, very little ground had been won: the Allied Forces had made just twelve kilometers. For this slight gain, a more than a million lives were lost. There were more than 400,000 British, 200,000 French, and 500,000 German casualties during the fighting. Twelve Days is a narrative of the last spell of front-line duty performed by the 2/West Yorkshires. Written by Sidney Rogerson, a young officer in µB' Company, it gives an extraordinarily honest account of twelve days during the battle of the Somme. From the terrible panic of crossing no-man's-land, to the squalid drudgery of trench life, Rogerson creates a full and evocative picture of this horrific conflict.",Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","On 1 July, 1916, a continuous line of British soldiers climbed out from the trenches of the Somme into No Man's Land and began to walk steadily towards dug-in German troops armed with machine-guns and defended by thick barbed wire. By the end of that day, as old tactics were met by the reality of modern warfare, there had been more than 60,000 British casualties - a third of them fatal. Martin Middlebrook's classic account of the blackest day in the history of the British army draws on official records, local newspapers, autobiographies, novels and poems from the time. Most importantly, it also takes in the accounts of hundreds of survivors: normal men, many of them volunteers, who found themselves thrown into a scene of unparalleled tragedy and horror. Compelling and intensely moving, it describes the true events behind the sacrifice of a generation of young men - killed as much by the folly of their commanders as by the bullets of their enemies.",Paperback,,355 pages,"

","After an immense but useless bombardment, at 7.30 am. On 1 July 1916 the British Army went over the top and attacked the German trenches. It was the first day of the battle of the Somme, and on that day the British suffered nearly 60,000 casualties, two for every yard of their front. With more than fifty times the daily losses at El Alamein and fifteen times the British casualties on D-day, 1 July 1916 was the blackest day in the history of the British Army. But, more than that, it was a watershed in the history of the First World War. The Army that attacked on that day was the volunteer Army that had answered Kitchener's call. It had gone into action confident of a decisive victory. But by sunset on the first day on the Somme, no one could any longer think of a war that might be won. After that it was a struggle that had simply to be endured. Martin Middlebrook's research has covered not just official and regimental histories and tours of the battlefields, but interviews with hundreds of survivors, both British and German. As to the action itself, he conveys the overall strategic view and the terrifying reality of an new kind of war for front-line soldiers.",Hardcover,,365 pages,"

Yet, though numerous books have been written about Lewis's life and his dramatic conversion to Christianity, none have asked the important question of how he grew spiritually. Lyle Dorsett sets out to answer that question in Seeking the Secret Place.Drawing on Lewis's books, letters, and interviews with his contemporaries, Dorsett reveals how Lewis's faith grew on a steady diet of Scripture, prayer, and the sacraments--not only to show how his faith developed but to encourage readers on the path to spiritual growth.

Collected here are the four completed poems by Lewis: “Dymer,” “Launcelot,” “The Nameless Isle,” and “The Queen of Drum.” Though only “Dymer” was published in his lifetime, these poems display Lewis’s deep love for medieval and Renaissance poetry and themes, the influence of which can be seen throughout his fiction.""If the mode of the fantastic, of elves, hags, castles, and 'damosels clothed in bright pale airy clothes' is . . . for you, then come on in.""—The Christian Science Monitor",Paperback,,192 pages,"

","The Cosmic Trilogy relates the interplanetary travels of Ransom, C.S. Lewis's ill-informed and terrified victim who leaves Earth much against his will and who, in the first book of the trilogy, Out of the Silent Planet, published by the Bodley Head in 1938, encounters the imaginary and delightful world of Macalandra. In the second book, Perelandra (1943), Ransom is transported to a world of sweet smells and delicious tastes, a new Garden of Eden in which is enacted, with a difference, the story of Temptation. That Hideous Strength (1945) completes the trilogy and finds Dr Ransom returned from his travels in space and living in an English university town - where the Senior Common Room is given a mysterious depth, a more than earthly dimension which such things, in the author's view, always have in life.C.S. Lewis believed that popular science was the new mythology of his age, and in The Cosmic Trilogy he ransacks the uncharted territory of space and makes that mythology the medium of his spiritual imagination.",Paperback,,724 pages,"

","Out of the Silent Planet is the first novel of Lewis' Ransom Trilogy (also known as the Cosmic or Space Trilogy), which is considered his chief contribution to science fiction. A planetary romance with elements of medieval mythology, the trilogy concerns Dr. Elwin Ransom, a professor of philology who, like Christ, is offered as a ransom for mankind. On a walking tour of the English countryside, Ransom falls in with some slightly shady characters from his old university and wakes up to find himself naked in a metal ball in the middle of the light-filled heavens. He learns that he is on his way to a world called Malacandra by its natives, who call our world Thulcandra, the silent planet. The Malacandrans see planets as having tutelary spirits; those of the other planets are good and accessible, but Earth's is fallen and twisted.",Audio CD,,0 pages,"

","The Perelandra Garden Workbook II gives us the next step in the co-creative relationship with nature that was begun with the Perelandra Garden Workbook. And what a next step! The energy processes in Workbook II open a door to a new world in which we begin to discover that the balance and health of a garden and, for that matter, of all natural forms are more involved than just finding out what fertilizer is needed. A balanced garden or farm environment must also include balanced energy and vitality. And Workbook II introduces us to the many elements of a balanced garden or farm that we can't see--the energy elements. For those of you who wish to incorporate a co-creative partnership with nature in a home, apartment or office environment, both Workbook and Workbook II will be of special interest. You do not need to have a garden or farm to establish a partnership with nature and work co-creatively to achieve a balanced environment. The environmental processes introduced in the Workbook and the energy processes in the Workbook and the energy processes in Workbook II may be very different in concept, but they are equal in importance. To work with nature co-creatively through the environmental processes but ignore the energy processes would be to exclude half of the picture. We would, in fact, be tying one of our hands and one of nature's hands behind our respective backs.",Paperback,,199 pages,"

","Over the past decade, the World Bank has evolved its analysis and reporting on poverty to a multi-dimensional view which includes issues of vulnerability, social isolation, and powerlessness. This broader construct, which considers the concepts of social exclusion and social capital, suggests the need for augmenting quantitative research with qualitative research. Qualitative research provides a focus on understanding human behavior, perceptions and practices that can then be applied to policy development. This report presents specific examples drawn from World Bank work completed in the countries of the former Soviet Union. Each of these examples illustrates the gains that can be derived from combining the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods.",Paperback,,464 pages,"

","In Things Fall Apart, Chinua Achebe articulates and dramatizes a unique and peculiar kind of rhetoric- a rhetoric that emphasizes that man, and not language, is the site for social interaction. The oracle and the bull are synthesized, metamorphosed, laced, and condensed to form an alchemy which produces a cohesive communal community as the end result. This African rhetoric displays a language that is innocent, unlike the Western European rhetoric where language dramatizes multiple voices. This critical text focuses on Achebe's rhetoric from the Aristotelian style.",Hardcover,,75 pages,"

","In a delicate balance between old and new, Nueva Granada presents a long personal interview that has never before been published to complement a fresh, updated selection of Robert Franklin Gish's many essays and articles about Paul Horgan and his Southwestern writings. In a career that spans seven decades, Paul Horgan's fiction and non-fiction have provided readers with an ardent regard for the lives and landscapes, history and lore of the land the Spanish explorers called Nueva Granada. As Gish revisits Horgan's work, he discovers an evolving Southwest, a land filled with diversity and new perspectives. In No Quarter Given, A Distant Trumpet, The Peach Stone, Far from Cibola, Whitewater, Josiah Gregg and His Early West, The Thin Mountain Air, Conquistadors in North American History, Lamy of Santa Fe, Mexico Bay, and many other works, Horgan provides readers with a classic image of the West, but Gish shows us that Horgan transcends regions and touches on universal qualities. In fact, Gish stresses Horgan's recognition of a new West, a place that is not only dense with geographic diversity, but ethnic and cultural diversity as well. Both Horgan's work and Gish's critical essays and his interview with the author reveal the ""heroic triad"" of cultures. Nueva Granada explicitly explores Horgan's reactions to and portrayals of American Indian, Spanish/Mexican, and Anglo interrelationships in the old West that has now become new. Gish is a sensitive explorer as he travels the boundaries and borders of Horgan's fiction and history.",Hardcover,,160 pages,"

","From the bestselling author of Slaves of New York comes a hilarious, clear-eyed, satiric novel about the sad plight of a misguided woman on the make in Manhattan. Thirty-two-year-old Florence Collins is an ""aging filly-about-town""--still beautiful enough to be (sometimes) invited to the best parties and the right restaurants, but unmarried and rapidly going broke. In her world, marriage to a wealthy man is all that can save her, although Florence's hard-hearted search for security and status takes her on an inevitable downward spiral.New York ""society novels"" at the turn of the nineteenth century gave us a piercing look at the world and rituals of the city's wealthy; Janowitz here casts that tradition in a fresh light, giving us a tirn-of-the-century society novel that demonstrates how little seems to have changed. In a sly and unforgettable portrait of New York's haute monde, Janowitz brilliantly evokes a young woman's struggle for love and survival in the city that is as unforgiving today as it was a hundred years ago.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","From the acclaimed author of the national bestseller Ahab's Wife comes an inspiring, brilliantly rendered new novel of the awakening conscience of the South and of an entire nation.Written with the same scope and emotional depth as her previous award-winning novel, Four Spirits is set in Sena Jeter Naslund's home city of Birmingham, Alabama, a city that in the 1960s was known as Bombingham. Naslund brings to life this tumultuous time, weaving together the lives of blacks and whites, civil rights advocates and racists, and the events of peaceful protest and violent repression, to create a tapestry of American social transformation.Stella Silver is an idealistic, young white college student brought up by her genteel, mannered aunts. She first witnesses the events of the freedom movement from a safe distance but, along with her friend Cat Cartwright, is soon drawn into the mounting conflagration. Stella's and Cat's lives are forever altered by their new friendships with other committed freedom fighters.A student at a black college, Christine Taylor is inspired to action by the examples of Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth. She courageously struggles to balance her family responsibilities, education, and work with the passions and dangers of the demonstrations. Her friend Gloria Callahan, a gifted young cellist and descendant of a runaway slave, tries to move beyond her personal shyness and family coziness to enter a wider circle, including blacks and whites, men and women, all involved with the protests. Lionel Parrish, teacher, preacher, and peddler of funeral insurance, battles his own demons of lust and self-preservation, while New York activist Jonathan Green gives up a promising career as a pianist to work for racial justice in the South.These characters all add their voices to the chorus that makes up this symphony of innocent children and the mythic elderly, the devoutly religious and the skeptical humanist, the wealthy and the poor, the city and the country. Poignant and evocative, rich in historical detail, and filled with the humanity that is the hallmark of Naslund's fiction, Four Spirits is a compelling tale that transcends tragedy and evokes redemptive triumph.",Paperback,,560 pages,"

Although social realities -- racial and ethnic tensions, sexual harassment, and abuse -- make up their background, these are really love stories in which people discover and forgive one another. A daughter finds her father's kindness extends beyond her and their family; a wife discovers and forgives the affair between her husband and best friend; and, in the title story which takes the form of a letter to an almost-lover, the narrator winds through swirling eddies of memory and language to relate her present and past lives and the loves that have informed them.Written with a masterful sureness of hand and heart, these captivating, intimate stories display Sena Jeter Naslund's extraordinary presence as one of today's most rewarding writers of fiction.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

""Like everyone, I am born naked.""


With this opening line of Naslund's compelling new novel, a very human Marie Antoinette invites readers to live her story as she herself experiences it. From the lush gardens of Versailles to the lights and gaiety of Paris, the verdant countryside of France, and finally the stark and terrifying isolation of a prison cell, the young queen's life is joyful, poignant, and harrowing by turns. As her world of unprecedented royal splendor crumbles, the charming Marie Antoinette matures into a heroine of inspiring stature, one whose nobility arises not from the circumstance of her birth but from her courageous spirit.Marie Antoinette was a child of fourteen when her mother, the Empress of Austria, arranged for her to leave her family and her country to become the wife of the fifteen-year-old Dauphin, the future King of France. Coming of age in the most public of arenas, the young queen embraces her new family and the French people, and she is embraced in return. Eager to be a good wife and strong queen, she shows her new husband nothing but love and encouragement, though he repeatedly fails to consummate their marriage and in doing so, fails to give her the thing she—and the people of France—desires most: a child and an heir to the throne.Deeply disappointed and isolated in her own intimate circle apart from the social life of the court, the queen allows herself to remain ignorant of the country's growing economic and political crises. She entrusts her soul to her women friends, her music teacher, her hairdresser, the ambassador from Austria, and a certain Swedish count so handsome that admirers label him ""the Picture."" When her innocent and well-chaperoned pilgrimage to watch the sun rise is viciously misrepresented in satiric pamphlets as a drunken orgy, the people begin to turn against her. Poor harvests, bitter winters, war debts, and poverty precipitate rebellion and revenge as the royal family and many nobles are caught up in a murderous time known as ""the Terror.""With penetrant insight into new historical scholarship and with wondrous narrative skill, Naslund offers an intimate, fresh, and dramatic re-creation of this compelling woman that goes beyond popular myth. Abundance reveals a compassionate and spontaneous Marie Antoinette who rejected the formality and rigid protocol of the court; an enchanting and tenderhearted outsider who was loved by her adopted homeland and people until she became the target of revolutionary cruelty and violence; a dethroned queen whose depth of character sustained her in even the worst of times.Once again, Sena Jeter Naslund has shed new light on an important moment of historical change and made that time as real to us as the one we are living now. Exquisitely detailed, beautifully written, heartbreaking and powerful, Abundance is a novel that is impossible to put down.",Hardcover,,556 pages,"

","Her curiosity began as a teenager, with an awareness of her body and the reaction other people had to it. It continued with the realization that women’s bodies often gave them a strange power over men. As an adult, it became a fascination with professional sex workers, leading to a plunge into their world. Bare follows the author and her fellow dancers through Seattle strip clubs and bachelor parties, exploring in riveting detail Eaves’s own motivations and behavior, as well as those of her coworkers, as they make their way through the sometimes exhilarating, often disturbing world of stripping. This compelling, revealing memoir exposes the reader to that world behind the flashing lights and offers illuminating insights into the reasons women take up this work—and how it affects their identities and lives off the job.In its unstinting honesty, Bare demands that we take a closer look at the way sexuality is viewed in our culture; what, if anything, constitutes ""normal"" desire; the ethics of swapping money—or anything else—for sex; and how women and men navigate the perilous contradictions and double standards that make up today’s socio-sexual conversation.",Paperback,,344 pages,"

","7:15 am Hurrah! The wilderness years are over. For four weeks and five days now have been in functional relationship with adult male thereby proving am not love pariah as previously feared. So begins The Edge of Reason , Bridget Jones' hilarious foray into the not-so-sexy realities of relationships, the laughable legions of self-help theories and a television career that would have her model ""tiny shorts next to a blow-up of Fergie in gym wear"". Picking up where Bridget Jones' Diary left off, everyone's favourite singleton has finally landed her love, Mark Darcy. However, she's finding--among other things--that her dreamboat is less than ideal. Aside from never doing the washing up or foraging through the isles at Tesco, Mark, it seems, has taken an interest in the viperous ""jellyfish"" Rebecca, who has ""thighs like a baby giraffe"" and a penchant for boyfriend snatching. If that isn't enough, Richard ""I'm thinking bunny girl! I'm thinking Gladiator! I'm thinking canvassing MP!"" Finch, Bridget's smarmy, cocaine-encrusted boss and Executive Producer of Sit Up , wants her to be the show's clown, in effect making her the arse of television. What's more, a builder who has an obsession for large, slimy fish seems to have forgotten about the hole he knocked out in her flat, putting her entire life on display for the neighbours. Not to mention a mother who wants her to go to see Ms. Saigon with a Kikuya tribesman hijacked from Kenya. Never fear, Bridge's singleton posse--Shazzer, Jude and Tom--are always a phone call away and armed with bottles of Chardonnay, packs of Silk Cut, pizza and a cornucopia of self-help literature. Whether they're decoding acronyms in singles ads (GSOH and WLTM? ""Giant sore on head. Willy, limp, thin mollusc.""), developing the ground-breaking ""Pashima theory"" or dolling out unsolicited advice, the FOBs (friends of Bridget) make up most of the comedy.

","In this book a distinguished philosopher offers a comprehensive interpretation of Plato’s most controversial dialogue. Treating the Republic as a unity and focusing on the dramatic form as the presentation of the argument, Stanley Rosen challenges earlier analyses of the Republic (including the ironic reading of Leo Strauss and his disciples) and argues that the key to understanding the dialogue is to grasp the author’s intention in composing it, in particular whether Plato believed that the city constructed in the Republic is possible and desirable.Rosen demonstrates that the fundamental principles underlying the just city are theoretically attractive but that the attempt to enact them in practice leads to conceptual incoherence and political disaster. The Republic, says Rosen, is a vivid illustration of the irreconcilability of philosophy and political practice.",Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.",Paperback,,349 pages,"

In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.",Hardcover,,314 pages,"

","When former Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts' husband, Frank Roberts, was dying from lung cancer, she had to look inside of herself as well as beyond herself to find ways to survive what felt unbearable. What Barbara Roberts learned during the final year of her husband's life, and her subsequent years of grieving, fill the pages of this honest and inspiring new book.At the time of Frank's cancer recurrence, Barbara was governor of Oregon, and Frank was an Oregon State Senator—both passionately committed to their work and to one another. Together they had faced many challenges, but Frank's impending death would be their final, and perhaps their most trying and enriching journey. The Roberts turned to hospice for guidance and assistance once Frank decided to stop medical intervention.This practical and compassionate guide looks at the personal as well as the societal issues surrounding death and grief. Written for both the individual facing death and for those who must grieve after a death, Roberts offers readers enthusiastic support to abandon the silence that too often accompanies impending death and those who must grieve. Chapter titles include ""A Culture in Denial,"" ""Hospice,"" and ""Permission to be Weird.""",Paperback,,100 pages,"

In keeping with the views of Ernest Becker, Norman O.Brown and others, Calderwood argues that the denial of death is fundamental to both individuals and their cultures. By drawing on a fascinating rand of examples, he suggests how often and how variously Shakespeare dramatizes this desire for symbolic immortality.",Paperback,,,"

The essays demonstrate that recognition of this deeply rooted source of human behavior and attitudes provides a fertile organizing principle for the humanities and social sciences.The theory of Generative Death Anxiety is based on the recognition that if there is any uniquely human characteristic, it is the ability to anticipate and prepare for death. This recognition of mortality, however, runs directly counter to our survival instincts and must be repressed, thus creating a constant supply of repressed psychic energy--which, shaped by cultural and narrative factors, emerges in a rich array of human creativity and resourcefulness, but also in racism, religious chauvinism, reactive violence, and other types of pathological behavior.

","The two Canyon Ranch spas are rated No.1 and No.2 (they alternate positions) over and over by readers of the Conde Nast Traveler. Part of the allure are their stunning locations -- in the hills of Tucson, Arisona, and in the Berkshire mountains in Massachusetts -- but one of the best parts of a visit to Canyon Ranch is the food.Jeanne Jones developed and supervised the Canyon Ranch menu, and in Canyon Ranch Cooking,  she offers everyone a chance to eat the spas' low-cal, low-fat delicious food. The recipes all have detailed nutritional breakdowns to help you plan a healthy meal with a lot of variety. Perhaps best of all are the tips and techniques to help enhance flavor without adding calories. Why does spa food taste so good when nearly all the fat has been removed? Jones reveals all the secrets -- such as adding citrus or vinegar to lift ""flat"" flavors; grilling over aromatic wood; marinating meat and vegetables; cooking at low temperatures for long periods to ""marry"" flavors; roasting rapidly for crispy crusts and tender interiors; using dried fruit for rich and creamy fat-free sauces; and much, much more. Try the Canyon Ranch Guacamole, Osso Bucco and Cheese Enchiladas; enjoy Chocolate Mint Cake and Cherry Streusel Pie. This is not a cuisine of deprivation -- the food is wonderful, and the recipes for making it easy and sensible.This book can't give you a workout or a hike, but it does tell you how to plan your own spa weekend at home, with suggestions for exercise, relaxation, even theme parties for special Saturday night dining. The wonderful recipes and the luscious photographs are here to delight and inspire. With Canyon Ranch Cooking, the spa comes to you.",Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","Fred Underhill is a young cop on the rise in Los Angeles in the early 1950's -- a town blinded to its own grime by Hollywood glitter; a society nourished by newspaper lies that wants its heroes all-American and squeaky clean. A chance to lead on a possible serial killing is all it takes to fuel Underhill's reckless ambition - and it propels him into a dangerous alliance with certain mad and unstable elements of the law enforcement hierarchy. When the case implodes with disastrous consequences, it is Fred Underhill who takes the fall. His life is in ruins, his promising future suddenly a dream of the past. And his good and pure love for a crusading woman lawyer has been corrupted and may not survive. But even without the authority of a badge, Fred Underhill knows that his only hope for redemption lies in following the investigation to its grim conclusion. And the Hell to which he has been consigned for his sins is the perfect place to hunt for a killer who hungers but has no soul.",Paperback,,328 pages,"

","The Imus Ranch ransports the reader to a unique place that the author and her husband, talk-show host Don Imus, created: a 4,000-acre working cattle ranch set in rolling hills and mesa country 50 miles east of Santa Fe. The children--who have cancer--visit the Imus Ranch and work alongside authentic western ranch hands, learning to ride horses and rope calves. The experience refuels their bodies and their spirits, and they leave stronger than when they came.As Deirdre Imus explains: ""We welcome kids who have known too much sickness and too much death, and we give them something they urgently need: a sense of independence and purpose through healthy, vigorous living.""Not only do the kids enjoy adventure at the ranch, but they learn from the Imuses that nutritious foods are fundamental to a happy, healthy life. Illustrated with full-color photographs that reflect the ranch's warmth and vitality, the book presents more than 125 vegetarian recipes that meet the true taste test: kids and cowboys love them! Readers will come away with a new appreciation of how important and how easy it is to incorporate healthier living into their everyday lives.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Internationally renowned horse trainer Mark Rashid pays tribute to the horse that became his teacher. In Mark Rashid's fourth book, Life Lessons from a Ranch Horse, the teacher becomes the student when a nondescript, seven-year-old horse steps into his life. A famous horse trainer, known for listening to horses and working with them in a non-confrontational manner, Mark is faced with odd behavior from this horse, and he must reevaluate everything he understands about horses and about himself, as a trainer and as a person. Beginning with an untimely balk from Buck, who never falters, Mark tried to find out why it happened. Drawing on experiences as far reaching as the Navajo way and Japanese martial arts, Mark begins to piece together the workings of the mind of his horse. That process and the conclusions he reaches are the heart of this very personal story. What he finds challenges him to become a better horse trainer, but it also challenges him to become a better person. His argument that Buck, an everyday horse, has the ability to plan ahead and make choices in a consistent manner will challenge the reader to rethink his or her relationships with animals and way of dealing with life. In separate chapters, Mark describes the six life lessons he learned while working with Buck. Later in the book, he puts these lessons into practice, with topics such as blending, balance, and communication. Throughout the book, a philosophy of dealing with horses and of living life itself emerges. Mark's inimitable storytelling skills illuminate what Buck has to teach. Heart warming but gritty, Life Lessons From a Ranch Horse is not a conventional horse book. But, then again, Buck is not a conventional horse, nor is his owner a conventional horse trainer.",Paperback,,,"

","Hollywood Fuckpad, Hot Prowl Rape-O and Jungletown Jihad are vintage Ellroy: starting in 1983 and ending in the present day, they are interlinked novellas telling the story of a bad cop, Rick Jenson, and his twenty-year obsession with Donna Donahue, a beautiful Hollywood actress. The only way Rick can get close to Donna is by bringing her into investigations of the teeming Tinseltown underworld: psychopathic killers, stalkers and terrorists commingle in an unholy cocktail of sex, sleaze and violence. Jenson and Donahue cut a swathe through the cases, treading a high wire of danger and a fatal sexual attraction.The book also contains eight previously unpublished non-fiction articles ranging from cases from the Los Angeles Police Unsolved Homicide files to the first article Ellroy has ever written on his imaginative process: Where I Get My Weird Shit. This is James Ellroy's second collection of short pieces following on from Dick Contino's Blues. 'James Ellroy is a genius: the finest American crime writer since Raymond Chandler, and one of the most readable experimental writers in the world' TLS'All Ellroy's preoccupations are present: corruption, sex, violence, unsolved murders and excess by the dozen.

","James Ellroy is a unique and powerful writer with a tough and explosive voice. His obsession with the dark side of L. A. is personal and vital, triggered by the murder of his mother when he was ten. This defining event spawned an early addiction to paperback crime novels, and Ellroy's own writing is saturated in an often violent underworld of bent cops, politicians, stars, sleeze and rumour. Ellroy exploits memory, history, fact and fiction with relentless energy and panache. What emerges is an intense, mythical version of tinseltown in the second half of the twentieth century.",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","Since its inception in 1915, the Best American series has become the premier annual showcase for the country's finest short fiction and nonfiction. For each volume, a series editor reads pieces from hundreds of periodicals, then selects between fifty and a hundred outstanding works. That selection is pared down to the twenty or so very best pieces by a guest editor who is widely recognized as a leading writer in his or her field. This unique system has helped make the Best American series the most respected -- and most popular -- of its kind. In his introduction to this year's collection, James Ellroy explores the differences between the novel and the short story. Included here are experts at both forms. Featuring renowned novelists like Stuart Kaminsky, Michael Connelly, Joe Gores, and Robert B. Parker, as well as veterans of this series like Brendan DuBois, Michael Downs, Joyce Carol Oates, and Clark Howard, this edition will delight readers with its wide variety and peerless quality.",Paperback,,432 pages,"

","James Ellroy's trademark is his language: it is sometimes caustically funny and always brazen. When he's hitting on all cylinders, as he is in  My Dark Places, his style makes punchy rhythms out of short sentences using lingo such as ""scoot"" (dollar), ""trim"" (sex), and ""brace"" (to interrogate). But the premise for My Dark Places is what makes it especially compelling: Ellroy goes back to his own childhood to investigate the central mystery behind his obsession with violence against women--the death of his mother when he was 10 years old. It's hard to imagine a more psychologically treacherous, more self-exposing way in which to write about true crime. The New York Times calls it a ""strenuously involving book.... Early on, Mr. Ellroy makes a promise to his dead mother that seems maudlin at first: 'I want to give you breath.' But he's done just that and--on occasion--taken ours away.""",Hardcover,,355 pages,"

","""This is the city, Los Angeles, California. I work here, I carry a badge. The story you are about to see is true...""Before Charlie's Angels, Miami Vice, or NYPD Blue, there was Dragnet. From 1951 to 1959, Jack Webb starred as Sergeant Joe Friday in the most successful police drama in television history. Webb (""Just the facts, ma'am"") was also the creator of Dragnet, and what made the show so revolutionary was its documentary-style format and the fact that each episode was ""ripped"" from the files of the LAPD. But 1950s television censors deemed many of the stories in the LAPD's files too violent or sensational for the airwaves. The Badge is Webb's collection of stories that could not be presented on TV: untold, behind-the-scenes accounts of the Black Dahlia murder, the Brenda Allen confessions, Stephen Nash's ""thrill murders,"" and Donald Bashor's ""sleeping lady murders,"" to name just a few. Case by case, The Badge takes readers on a spine chilling police tour through the dark, shadowy world of Los Angeles crime.""Some books influence a writer.

","The moving, inspiring memoir of one of the great women of our times, Shirin Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and advocate for the oppressed, whose spirit has remained strong in the face of political persecution and despite the challenges she has faced raising a family while pursuing her work. Best known in this country as the lawyer working tirelessly on behalf of Canadian photojournalist, Zara Kazemi – raped, tortured and murdered in Iran – Dr. Ebadi offers us a vivid picture of the struggles of one woman against the system. The book movingly chronicles her childhood in a loving, untraditional family, her upbringing before the Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah, her marriage and her religious faith, as well as her life as a mother and lawyer battling an oppressive regime in the courts while bringing up her girls at home.Outspoken, controversial, Shirin Ebadi is one of the most fascinating women today. She rose quickly to become the first female judge in the country; but when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges she was demoted to clerk in the courtroom she had once presided over. She eventually fought her way back as a human rights lawyer, defending women and children in politically charged cases that most lawyers were afraid to represent. She has been arrested and been the target of assassination, but through it all has spoken out with quiet bravery on behalf of the victims of injustice and discrimination and become a powerful voice for change, almost universally embraced as a hero.Her memoir is a gripping story – a must-read for anyone interested in Zara Kazemi’s case, in the life of a remarkable woman, or in understanding the political and religious upheaval in our world.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","When Harvard medical student Alexa Albert conducted a public-health study as the Mustang Ranch brothel in Nevada, the only state in the union where prostitution is legal, neither she nor the brothel could have predicted the end result. Having worked with homeless prostitutes in Times Square, Albert was intimate with human devastation cause by the sex trade, and curious to see if Nevada’s brothels offered a less harmful model for a business that will always be with us. The Mustang Ranch has never before given an outsider such access, but fear of AIDS was hurting the business, and the Ranch was eager to get publicity for its rigorous standards of sexual hygiene. Albert was drawn into the lives of the women of the Mustang Ranch, and what began as a public-health project evolved into something more intimate and ambitious, a six-year study of the brothel ecosystem, its lessons and significance. The women of the Mustang Ranch poured their stories out to Albert: how they came to be there, their surprisingly deep sense of craft and vocation, how they reconciled their profession with life on the outside. Dr. Albert went as far into this world as it is possible to go — some will say too far — including sitting in on sessions with customers, and the result is a book that puts an unforgettable face on America’s maligned and caricatured subculture.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","A seafaring story with a twist -- the incredible voyage of a shipload of ""disorderly girls"" and the men who transported them, fell for them, and sold them.This riveting work of rediscovered history tells for the first time the plight of the female convicts aboard the Lady Julian, which set sail from England in 1789 and arrived in Australia's Botany Bay a year later. The women, most of them petty criminals, were destined for New South Wales to provide its hordes of lonely men with sexual favors as well as progeny. But the story of their voyage is even more incredible, and here it is expertly told by a historian with roots in the boatbuilding business and a true love of the sea.Siân Rees delved into court documents and firsthand accounts to extract the stories of these women's experiences on board a ship that both held them prisoner and offered them refuge from their oppressive existence in London. At the heart of the story is the passionate relationship between Sarah Whitelam, a convict, and the ship's steward, John Nicol, whose personal journals provided much of the material for this book. Along the way, Rees brings the vibrant, bawdy world of London -- and the sights, smells, and sounds of an eighteenth-century ship -- vividly to life. In the tradition of Nathaniel Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea, this is a winning combination of dramatic high seas adventure and untold history.",Hardcover,,236 pages,"

","Prostitution thrived in pioneer Colorado. Mining was the principal occupation and men outnumbered women more than twenty to one. Jan MacKell provides a detailed overview of the business between 1860 and 1930, focusing her research on the mining towns of Cripple Creek, Salida, Colorado City, and similar boomtown communities. She used census data, Sanborn maps, city directories, property records, marriage records, and court records to document and trace the movements of the women over the course of their careers, uncovering work histories, medical problems, and numerous relocations from town to town. She traces many to their graves, through years filled with abuse, disease, narcotics, and violence. MacKell has unearthed numerous colourful and often touching stories, like that of the boy raised in a brothel who was invited to play with a neighbour's children and replied, No, my mother is a whore and says I am to stay at home.",Hardcover,,310 pages,"

","The state of Nevada is known as a place for quick money, 24-hour marriages, and easy divorces. But it's also the only place in the United States with a legal sex industry. About 300 women today work in Nevada brothels, all regulated by the state government. Often shunned from serious condsideration, little is known about the prostitutes or the environments in which they work. In Brothels of Nevada, photographer Timothy Hursley offers a view of this unknown side of America. He exposes the sites in all their variety and complexity, from neon signs on double-wide trailers, to red-toned bars where workers and customers meet, to bedrooms lined with velvet and lace. Far from risque, the images are poignant reminders of how little brothels differ from many American settings. Hursley photographs twenty-five houses, roughly the entire sex industry, in views from the mid-1980s to today. Brothels of Nevada includes large well-known places like the Chicken Ranch and Mustang Ranch as well as tiny houses off the beaten track, like Angel's Ladies and Bobbie's Buckeye Bar. Alexa Albert addresses how the design of the brothels affects the work they house.",Paperback,,192 pages,"

","The prostitute, and her sister in sin - the so-called 'fallen' woman - were veritable obsessions of American Progressive Era culture. Their cumulative presence, in scores of controversial theatrical productions, demonstrates the repeated obsession with the prostitute figure in both highbrow and lowbrow entertainments. As the first extended examination of such dramas during the Progressive Era, Sisters in Sin recovers a slice of theatre history in demonstrating that the prostitute was central to American realist theatre. Such plays about prostitutes were so popular that they constituted a forgotten genre - the brothel play. The brothel drama's stunning success reveals much about early twentieth-century American anxieties about sexuality, contagion, eugenics, women's rights and urbanization. Introducing previously unexamined archival documents and unpublished play scripts, this original study argues that the body of the prostitute was a corporeal site upon which modernist desires and cultural imperatives were mapped.",Hardcover,,265 pages,"

","Midnight Louie, alley-cat extraordinaire and Las Vegas's hairiest, hard-boiled PI, finds himself literally walking a tightrope when a fabulous museum opening at one of Sin City's swankiest casinos is marred by a little thing like death.Louie's loyal roommate, feisty PR freelancer Temple Barr, has snagged the commission of her career: repping the opening exhibition of the Russian Czars' priceless treasures at the New Millennium Hotel, the apex of which is the Czar Alexander Scepter, a priceless jewel-encrusted artifact.Trouble is, the hotel has booked an aerial magic act right above the exhibition.Temple works at a breakneck pace to coordinate this logistical nightmare. Tragedy ensues when a performer dies right above where the collection will be displayed and the police threaten to shut everything down. But the word ""no"" isn't one heard often in Las Vegas when money is involved and the show (or shows) must go on. Just as things seem to be working perfectly, another performer dies…and the scepter vanishes. The culprits could be international art thieves, Russian mafioso, or Chechen rebels out to embarrass the current Russian government.Or it could be someone else, perhaps someone Temple knows all too well . . . .Temple and Louie both have enemies in the magic act--evil magician Shangri-La and her curare-nailed performing Siamese cat, Hyacinth--and on the ground--ever-suspicious homicide lieutenant Carmen Molina, who's itching to pin the heist and murders on Temple's significant other, ex-magician and sometimes ex-spy Max Kinsella, now oddly AWOL. Worse, as Temple and Louie's separate investigations bring them both close to the truth, it's clear that someone has decided to hang them out to die too.Can fancy footwork and detection save our intrepid duo?

","If satirists are at their best when tussling with something they hate, then this is P.J. O'Rourke's masterpiece. He clearly hates government--and has hated it since before it was cool to do so--and for all the right reasons, too: it's clumsy, inefficient, hypocritical, greedy, and arrogant. In other words, it magnifies the faults of the poor saps who staff it. Parliament of Whores is the humorist's howl of bitter laughter at the entire bloated, numskulled mess. As befits an ex-editor of National Lampoon, nothing is out of bounds for O'Rourke. Speaking of the fabled ""football""--that satchel that follows the president around 24/7--the author doubts there are really launch codes in there at all--nothing but ""a copy of Penthouse and a pint bottle of Hiram Walker--a Penthouse from back in the seventies, when Penthouse was really dirty, I'll bet.""Parliament of Whores is perfect for anyone who longs to cultivate an entertaining brand of cynicism, to be ""a lone voice--not crying in the wilderness, thank you, but chortling in the rec room."" O'Rourke is a master at making you laugh in spite of the better angels of your nature, and the only negative thing to be said about this tour de force is that his flamethrower brand of satire leaves nothing in its wake--certainly not the suggestion of an improvement. --Michael Gerber",,,,,"['Humor', 'Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'History']"

","Called ""an everyman's guide to Washington"" (The New York Times), P. J. O'Rourke's savagely funny and national best-seller Parliament of Whores has become a classic in understanding the workings of the American political system. Originally written at the end of the Reagan era, this new edition includes an extensive foreword by the renowned political writer Andrew Ferguson  showing us that although the names and the players have changed, the game is still the same. Parliament of Whores is an exuberant, broken-field run through the ethical foibles, pork-barrel flimflam, and bureaucratic bullrorfle inside the Beltway that leaves no sacred cow unskewered and no politically correct sensitivities unscorched. ""Highly pungent and wickedly accurate observations ... [from a] boisterous, pedal-to-the-floor humorist.""  The New York Times Book Review ""Outrageous ... It is insulting, inflammatory, profane, and absolutely great reading.""  The Washington Post Book World ""A gonzo civics book ...

","""In the tradition of Fannie Flagg, veteran storyteller Helen Chappell, acclaimed author of ""Giving Up the Ghost,"" presents a wry, funny, and poignant novel about two sisters, their dead mother, and a Chesapeake Bay town where anything can happen and frequently does.""  Sometimes you ""have"" to go home again, even if you know the trip is going to be one from hell. When Carrie points her van in the direction of Oysterback, Maryland, her old hometown, she does it only because she has no choice. Her momma, the indomitable Audrey, has done the unthinkable: she's died. And it wasn't a neat little Oysterback death either. No, it happened in Florida and involved an alligator. But, then again, there was nothing conventional about Audrey, even in life. The same could be said for her daughter Carrie -- single, perpetually searching, and professionally adrift, she has become an expert at yard sales, sifting through the detritus of other folks' lives, then reselling it to shops that sell antiques and assorted ""collectibles."" Her sister, Earlene, considers Carrie a junk collector, but then Earlene has devoted her life to being conventional. Married with two boys, she has remained in Oysterback where she and her husband run the View 'n' Chew, a combination video store-sandwich shop.Momma had lived by the notion that a woman is incomplete without a man and spent the years following her husband's death trying to be as complete as humanly possible -- in the process working her way through a whole parade of men. As best Carrie can figure, her momma's last two flames were Alonzo Deaver, the town's resident miscreant and a current resident of the state penitentiary, and Jack Shepherd, acollege professor on the run from failure and boredom. Both had been granted carte blanche to crash at Momma's house whenever the occasion should arise (be it Alonzo's planned escape from prison or Jack's escape from his ratty little boat).Once back in Oysterback, Carrie finds herself unwittingly caught up in a family drama of epic proportions -- including Earlene's resentment (which leads to a classic -- and very messy -- confrontation), a now-married ex-boyfriend's attempt to rekindle an old flame, her own attraction to Professor Jack, and a roiling stew of anger and grief over Momma's poorly timed passing. For while Carrie never expected to go home again, she naively believed it always would be there.""A Whole World of Trouble"" is a delightfully authentic comedy of Southern manners and an antic, frequently hilarious, pointed, and moving novel by a writer who knows the people and the world she writes about.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","This is the latest of American contemporary artist Fred Wilson's views on art and its sheltering institution, the museum. Wilson is best known for site-specific installations in which he rearranges museum collections into unusual displays of seemingly disparate objects. Using what appear to be standard curatorial and display practices, Wilson's exhibits examine unexpected relationships among objects, people, and places. Wilson developed So Much Trouble in the World at the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College using the museum's permanent collection to shed light on the politics of museum collecting, cultural representation, and human nature. The exhibit raises questions about our past and its relationship to the present--whether at Dartmouth, in the wider United States, or beyond our borders. Wilson encourages viewers to scrutinize their own expectations of museums, art, and society in light of the economic and ideological mechanisms and relationships that shape them.The essayists in this book explore Wilson's installation, including the many artists, statesmen, showmen, and nameless others whom the artist encountered while producing So Much Trouble in the World. Daniel Webster, the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, Martin Luther King Jr., Francisco de Goya, Jacques Callot, Abraham Lincoln, Samson Occom, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Robert L. Ripley, and the horrific and tragic story of Ota Benga all have a place in this extraordinary installation and publication.",Paperback,,84 pages,"

","An NYRB Classics OriginalThe first of the great Russian novels and one of the indisputable masterpieces of world literature, Dead Souls is the tale of Chichikov, an affably cunning con man who causes consternation in a small Russian town when he shows up out of nowhere proposing to buy title to serfs who, though dead as doornails, are still property on paper. What can he have up his sleeve, the local landowners wonder, even as some rush to unload what isn’t of any use to them anyway, while others seek to negotiate the best deal possible, and others yet hold on to their dead for dear life, since if somebody wants what you have then no matter what don’t give it away. Chichikov’s scheme soon encounters obstacles, but he is never without resource, and as he stumbles forward as best he can, Gogol paints a wonderfully comic picture of Russian life that also serves as a biting satire of a society as corrupt as it is cynical and silly. At once a wild phantasmagoria and a work of exacting realism, Dead Souls is a supremely living work of art that spills over with humor and passion and absurdity.       Donald Rayfield’s vigorous new translation corrects the mistakes and omissions of earlier versions while capturing the vivid speech rhythms of the original. It also offers a fuller text of the unfinished second part of the book by combining material from Gogol’s two surviving drafts into a single compelling narrative. This is a tour de force of art and scholarship—and the most authoritative, accurate, and readable edition of Dead Souls available in English.",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","A classic history of the Federal Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, the stormy, dramatic session that produced the most enduring of political documents: the Constitution of the United States.From Catherine Drinker Bowen, noted American biographer and National Book Award winner, comes the canonical account of the Constitutional Convention recommended as ""required reading for every American."" Looked at straight from the records, the Federal Convention is startlingly fresh and new, and Mrs. Bowen evokes it as if the reader were actually there, mingling with the delegates, hearing their arguments, witnessing a dramatic moment in history.Here is the fascinating record of the hot, sultry summer months of debate and decision when ideas clashed and tempers flared. Here is the country as it was then, described by contemporaries, by Berkshire farmers in Massachusetts, by Patrick Henry's Kentucky allies, by French and English travelers. Here, too, are the offstage voices--Thomas Jefferson and Tom Paine and John Adams from Europe. In all, fifty-five men attended; and in spite of the heat, in spite of clashing interests--the big states against the little, the slave states against the anti-slave states--in tension and anxiety that mounted week after week, they wrote out a working plan of government and put their signatures to it.",Paperback,,346 pages,"

Fred Anderson takes readers on a remarkable journey through the vast conflict that, between 1755 and 1763, destroyed the French Empire in North America, overturned the balance of power on two continents, undermined the ability of Indian nations to determine their destinies, and lit the ""long fuse"" of the American Revolution.

","Who are the pivotal figures in American history—the men and women who have helped shape who we are as a people and how we look at ourselves as Americans? In this companion to his popular 1001 Events That Made America, Alan Axelrod suggests we can answer this question only after we look with an open mind into all the areas of our collective past. 1001 People Who Made America does just that, highlighting the famous as well as the infamous, the virtuous as well as the notorious, from the nation's earliest days to the present. Serving up history in lively, accessible bits, the book presents a who's who of American politics, arts, science, business, religion, and pop culture, along with concise explanations of each figure's historical significance. Featured personalities range from Jesse James to Al Capone, Harriet Beecher Stowe to Betty Friedan, George Washington to George W. Bush, Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King, Jr., Stephen Foster to Elvis, John L. Sullivan to Muhammad Ali, Edwin Booth to Marlon Brando, Washington Irving to Thomas Pynchon, Jacob Aster to Bill Gates. Axelrod's writing is packed with information and insight, giving readers a deeper understanding of what it means to be an American.

The city has been blockaded by the French but is supported by the British from the sea. It contains a rare mix of pro- and anti-British citizens, diplomats, courtiers, adventurers, and spies. Sharpe's mission -- complicated, undercover, and political -- turns out to be completely different from the one on which he was sent. It brings him through the besieging enemy army to triumph in the Battle of Barrosa, where the British, deserted by their allies, defeat an overwhelmingly stronger French force.",Audio CD,Unabridged,0 pages,"

","Four thousand years ago, a stranger's death at the Old Temple of Ratharryn-and his ominous ""gift"" of gold-precipitates the building of what for centuries to come will be known as one of mankind's most singular and remarkable achievements. Bernard Cornwell's epic novel Stonehenge catapults us into a powerful and vibrant world of ritual and sacrifice at once timeless and wholly original-a tale of patricide, betrayal, and murder; of bloody brotherly rivalry: and of the never-ending quest for power, wealth, and spiritual fulfillment.Three brothers-deadly rivals-are uneasily united in their quest to create a temple to their gods. There is Lengar, the eldest, a ruthless warrior intent on replacing his father as chief of the tribe of Ratharryn; Camaban, his bastard brother, a sorcerer whose religious fervor inspires the plan for Stonehenge; and Saban, the youngest, through whose expertise the temple will finally be completed. Divided by blood but united-precariously-by a shared vision, the brothers begin erecting their mighty ring of granite, aligning towering stones to the movement of the heavenly bodies, and raising arches to appease and unite their gods. Caught between the zealousness of his ambitious brothers, Saban becomes the true leader of his people, a peacemaker who will live to see the temple built in the name of salvation and regeneration.Bernard Cornwell, long admired for his rousing narrative and meticulous historical imaginings, has here delivered his masterpiece, the most compelling and powerful human drama of its kind since Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and Edward Rutherford's Sarum. His re-creation of civilization as it might have been in 2000 B.C. at once amplifies the mystery of his subject and makes the world of Stonehenge come alive as never before.",Paperback,,578 pages,"

","Since its first and prize-winning edition of 1983, ""Stonehenge Complete has established itself as the classic account of this most famous of ancient places. For this new edition, Christopher Chippindale has revised and updated the story to include the latest theories and discoveries. People have puzzled over Stonehenge for centuries, speculating and dreaming about it, drawing and painting it, trying to make sense of it. Here is the story of the one real Stonehenge, as well as the many unreal Stonehenges that archaeologists, tourists, mystics, astronomers, artists, poets, and visionaries have made out of it. New studies in the last decade have revolutionized our knowledge of the complex sequence of structures that make its celebrated profile; remarkably, these new discoveries have been made without new excavations. Stonehenge today is as lively as it ever was. After a period of dissent and confrontation, visitors are once again welcome to see the sun rise over the Heel stone on midsummer solstice day, and some 20,000 people are expected to gather at midsummer dawn this year. As the new edition explains, they are in error: although Stonehenge is indeed astronomically oriented, it is not aligned on the midsummer sunrise at all.",Paperback,Third Edition,312 pages,"

","This book is an imaginative exploration of a place that has fascinated, intrigued and perplexed visitors for centuries. Instead of seeing Stonehenge as an isolated site, the author sets the stones within a wider landscape and explores how use and meaning have changed from prehistoric times right through to the present.Throughout the millennia, the Stonehenge landscape has been used and re-used, invested with new meanings, and has given rise to myths and stories. The author creatively explores how the landscape has been appropriated and contested, and invokes the debates and experiences of people who have very different and often conflicting experiences of the same place. Today, heritage managers, archaeologists, local people, free festivallers, and druids come to the place with entirely different understandings and agendas. The book demonstrates that the creation of spaces and places for people to express divergent viewpoints is powerfully constrained by social and political forces that allow some voices to be heard while others are marginalized. With dialogues and illustrations that range from the conventional to the cartoon strip, this multi-vocal book not only presents a wide range of views in an innovative way, but provides important new insights on how people shape and are shaped by landscape.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

This stunning book comprises an anthology of photographs, which recall 150 years of day trippers, royal picnickers, custodians, archaeologists, politicians (notably Churchill), romantics, experimental archaeologists, African warriors, druids, hippies, protestors and hooligans who have all been drawn to Britain's most famous monument. Almost as interesting as the people are the photographs of the modes of transport that brought them to the stones which were then unceremoniously parked among the stones, including steam engines, caravans, horses and the very first cars. The photos demonstrate above all the sheer contrast in visitor numbers between 1853 and the present day. Throughout, the photographs are accompanied by a fascinating narrative in which Julian Richards the events that have shaped Stonehenge over the last 150 years and the reasons for its continuing hold over the human imagination.",Hardcover,,118 pages,"

In this provocative and encouraging book, Jane Goodall sounds a clarion call to Western society, urging us to take a hard look at the food we produce and consume-and showing us how easy it is to create positive change.Offering her hopeful, but stirring vision, Goodall argues convincingly that each individual can make a difference. She offers simple strategies each of us can employ to foster a sustainable society. Brilliant, empowering, and irrepressibly optimistic, HARVEST FOR HOPE is one of the most crucial works of our age. If we follow Goodall's sound advice, we just might save ourselves before it's too late.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Harvest of Hope is the remarkable autobiography of Dr. Jorge Prieto, a respected physician and former president of the Chicago Board of Health. Prieto immigrated to the United States as a struggling intern from Mexico and dedicated his life to bringing medical care to the disadvantaged and displaced Hispanic community in the United States. It is this experience that lends so much credence and compassion to this book. Prieto's story is one of faith, hope, and love in the face of hardship and discrimination; and it is both a professional and a personal pilgrimage through half a century of dynamic change in medicine and the Hispanic community.",Paperback,,168 pages,"

","In an effort to escape the oppression of his older brother, Johnny, a farm boy growing up during the Great Depression, disappears into the night. He hops a freight train heading west with only an address he has ripped from a bag of seed corn in his pocket, and his meager savings hidden in his sock. After tasting life in the hobo jungles, he finds employment on a farm in the mid-West. When the love of his life leaves for college, he decides to return home to finish his own education. Though welcomed warmly by his family, he becomes guilt ridden upon the discovery of the tragedies his disappearance brought about. As a young adult, Johnny assumes responsibility for his family and becomes first a mentor, then a pal to his young neighbor. The story is colored by mystery, romance, and anxiety, as the Great Depression dissipates and the country is thrown into World War II. Johnny's fiancee and his young neighbor both enlist in the armed services. Actual letters from the war front confirm the loneliness and despair of those separated from their loved ones, and their eagerness at war's end to leave the memories of the battlefields behind, pick up where they left off, and start new families.",Paperback,,379 pages,"

","The image of the family farm as storehouse of the traditional values that built this nation -- self-reliance, resourcefulness, civic pride, family strength, concern for neighbors and community, honesty, and friendliness -- persists, as many recent surveys show. But the reality of this rich tradition is rapidly changing, eroding the security once represented by these nostalgic images of rural America.Although the United States is still by far the world's leading overall producer of agricultural products, the number of American families making their livelihood through farming is much diminished, and if our demographers are correct, the number of family-operated farms is destined to fall still further in the coming decades as consolidation, cycles of boom and bust, and corporate invasions redefine who will farm the land.Harvest of Hope is a story of farm family life through the words of those who live it. The saga of the generations who have lived and worked on Basin Spring farm in western Kentucky is the thread that binds together the stories of eighty other farm families. They talk about their family businesses, their way of life, and the forces reshaping their lives.The challenges of making a living in farming either strengthen families or break them. Technology, government programs, and community changes that are supposed to be the hope for their future often come with unexpected drawbacks. The stories in this book -- tales of growing up in farming, working in a multifamily business, juggling jobs on and off the farm, and struggling to maintain financial security and comfortable working relationships -- reveal what American farming families know about hope and survival in a changing world.The authors offer a multifaceted view of the present situation, as well as suggestions for ways of enhancing the positive elements that have enriched and inspired Americans in the past. It is an analysis that highlights the myths and realities of a business and way of life that has a powerful hold on the American imagination. The reader comes away from this work with a clear idea of the tribulations farming families endure and the delicate balance between the spiritual and other rewards of farm life.",Hardcover,,248 pages,"

","All gardeners love plants but if you love them too much the chances are you will end up with a plant collection rather than a garden. Help is at hand from confirmed plantaholic and architect Roger Turner, who describes how to indulge a passion for collecting plants without forfeiting the joys of a coherent, well-designed garden. Happily, the book prescribes little need to curb the excesses of plant addiction but simply recommends ways of focusing it to the advantage of all who share or visit your garden. Good collections need to be displayed well so that you can see them properly. The first part of the book looks at the structure of the garden as a whole, the balance of 'empty space' to 'planted space', the use of framing devices, and the value of paths in providing routes around the garden. At the heart of the book is a large section on plants that proposes ideas and solutions for making gardens with different types of plant collections. Here you will find schemes for displaying collections of trees from small groups to full-scale arboreta; recommendations for single-genus collections that look well planted together in one bed; and the ideal 'space-holder' plants that cover bare earth before prize bulbs emerge. Over 200 eye-catching and informative photographs highlight successful planting methods and illustrate the rewards to be gained from finding the perfect setting for a treasured plant. Plant enthusiasts, collectors and gardeners everywhere will unite in their enthusiasm for this practical book that provides the key to making beautiful gardens while keeping the spotlight on the plants.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

As the story switches from the make-believe world he creates with his childhood friends-populated by Scrunch-Em, Grow-Em Dinosaurs and toy robots-to the grown-up pleasures of sex, drugs and alcohol, James falls in and out of love, and stumbles through New York City in search of dubious redemption.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Interviewer: ""On what occasions do you lie?"" Anthony Burgess: ""When I write, when I speak, when I sleep.""He was the last great modernist. Novelist, composer, librettist, essayist, semanticist, translator, critic, Anthony Burgess's versatility and erudition found expression in more than fifty books and dozens of musical compositions, from operas, choral works and song cycles to symphonies and concertos. Here now is a kaleidoscope of a book--the culmination of twenty years of writing and research--about a man who remains best known for A Clockwork Orange, the source of Stanley Kubrick's ground breaking, mind bending and prescient film.Tracking Burgess from Manchester to Malaya to Malta to Monte Carlo, the author assesses Burgess's struggles and uncovers the web of truth and illusion about the writer's famous antic disposition. Burgess, the author argues, was just as much a literary confidence man and prankster as a consummate wordsmith. Outrageously funny, honest and touching, Anthony Burgess explores the divisions that characterize its irascible subject and his darkly comic, bleakly beautiful world of fiction.",Hardcover,,480 pages,"

","Anthony Burgess combined high artistic seriousness with very broad popular appeal. The writer of A Clockwork Orange and Napoleon Symphony variously cast himself in the roles of uncompromising artist and willing entertainer. What links these contradictory aspirations is Burgess' ambivalent relationship with James Joyce. In his daring experimentation with the novel form, Burgess always had the Joycean example to emulate, but he also invoked the great precursor to vindicate the rawer components of his art. The author is not blinded by his comparative agenda to Burgess' debts incurred elsewhere. Burgess' work reverberates with echoes of lesser masters as well as securely canonized classics: his voices include the Maughamesque and the Shakespearean as they do the Eliotian and, of course, the Joycean. Anthony Burgess is thus reintroduced as a (post)modern classic himself: Jake's deserving peer and Will's true son.",Paperback,,148 pages,"

","In the indefinite future, an impoverished United States has sold its Southwestern and Pacific Coast states to Mexico. Seattle is giverned by administrators and police sent from Mexico on hardship tours. Human life has been brutalized. At night, gangs control the streets. Idealistic revolutionaries are no less brutal than the gangs. The Prisoner's son portrays a bottoming-out of society, an America that is pathological at every level. The protagonist, Sam Brave (readers of The Inquisitor will recognize Sam as Bill Brave's son), is kidnapped by a gang of revolutionaries in retaliation for something bad that Sam did to them. If the revolutionaries are psychopathic, Sam is not the nicest guy in the world either. His imprisonment--based on the Patricia Hearst case--results in his taking on the coloration of his captors--to an extent. The plot of this novel, dealing with an attempted assassination, is based on an act of terror committed by the People's Will party of nineteenth-century Russia. Thus, while The Prisoner's Son is (social) science fiction, it is based on historical events.",Paperback,,194 pages,"

","A comparison between a novel and its film adaptation often fails to consider the essential characteristics of the two separate media. Among cinematic adaptations which have drawn critical attention are the films produced from John Fowles' novels ""The Collector, The Magus,"" and ""The French Lieutenant's Woman""; these novels, in fact, are particularly challenging for filmmakers not only because of their complex structures and layers of meanings but also because of the points of view which Fowles chose for each. Focusing on the cinematic equivalents of these Fowles novels, this work examines the basic structure of fiction, screenplays, and film.",Hardcover,,152 pages,"

","John Fowles, best known as the author of The French Lieutenant's Woman, has also written numerous other works--fiction as well as nonfiction. This unique reference book by James R. Aubrey lists all of Fowles's writings for the first time. It also provides a detailed biography, criticism of his work from the perspective of various disciplines, explanatory notes, a census of characters, and a comprehensive bibliography.Aubrey begins with a biography of Fowles, based on information from his writings, published and personal interviews, and correspondence. This section also includes several photographs. The next section discusses Fowles's lesser-known nonfiction work by genre--philosophy, autobiography, biography, translations, book reviews, literary and visual-art criticism, history, and social commentary. Aubrey then pulls together the fiction of John Fowles in the order it was published. For each novel or short story Aubrey provides a description of the circumstances and process of composition, summarization, discussion of its public reception, and critiques of the film, television, or stage adaptations. Critical approaches to Fowles's fiction are covered next: biographical, psychological, post-structuralist, historicist, feminist, reader-response, and formalist. The notes, census of characters, and extensive bibliography complete this reference companion. Aubrey's book will be useful for those studying Fowles and his work, and will be an excellent addition to public and academic libraries.",Hardcover,,344 pages,"

","This study of Alan Sillitoe's early work focuses in particular on Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958) and The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner (1959). John Sawkins sees their heroes Arthur Seaton and Colin Smith in their resistance to a conformist society as embodying the concept of Alienation (Estrangement). As such they are representatives of a tradition that goes back in its original metaphysical sense to Langland, Milton, Bunyan and the Bible and in its social and economic senses to Karl Marx, John Ruskin, William Blake und Albert Camus. Sawkins also suggests that Sillitoe's characters have perhaps acquired the dignity of standard-bearers. What rights do they uphold, what wrongs do they sustain? Or are they merely trouble-makers in an otherwise orderly society?",Paperback,,,"

","A log cabin in the woods is one of America's most cherished icons -- a dream shared around the world. As the stress level of city life rises, more and more of us are imagining our own cottages far away from traffic lights and urban distractions. Cabins in the wilderness have never gone out of style, because the rustic life is a simple, rewarding one rooted in the traditions of the great outdoors.  Featuring rustic interiors as well as North Woods architecture, Cabin Fever visits more than two dozen charming retreats old and new, large and small, in the mountains and along the water, from the wilds of New York out to the wild, wild West. Author Rachel Carley explains where our love for the rustic comes from and shows the amazingly varied guises in which it appears today.  After serving as settlers' cabins, log homes enjoyed a phenomenal popularity in the late nineteenth century. Wealthy families such as the Vanderbilts, Guggenheims, and Carnegies summered in areas as remote as they could find, building what were euphemistically called camps. Those less affluent, following the era's prescription for fresh air and simplicity, traveled to even more rustic hotels and vacation cabins to get their share of the refreshing woods. Cabin Fever presents some of the best of these old lodges and private cabins, along with striking new homes that give a contemporary twist to the ideal of the rustic life.  To help fill a cabin, a whole camp, or even an apartment with the latest in rustic style, the book's catalogue shows where to find home furnishings from twig bedsteads to Hudson Bay blankets to Adirondack chairs. Brimming with exceptionally creative ideas for achieving this truly American look, this enchanting guide to living with the rustic style will cure every variety of cabin fever.",Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","Trevor White's hilarious account of life as a restaurant critic is also a social history of restaurant criticism and an exposé of the restaurant business. The author reveals how diners are routinely ripped off by self-styled artists and greedy restaurateurs, while arguing that anyone can become a food critic - all you need is a pen and an appetite.This defiantly populist critique of restaurant culture redefines the dining room as a place in which humans can be greatly satisfied, rather than an artist's studio. From the world's first restaurant to the most fashionable kitchens of London, Paris and New York, Kitchen Con is a book-length tribute to dinner but also a scathing attack on gourmet dogma.Written with style, humour and breathtaking candour, Kitchen Con lifts the lid on the culinary cartel in a whirlwind tour of the world's great restaurants, before turning its attention to the greatest con of all: the author himself. No one is spared in this riveting tale of life at the heart of the restaurant racket.",Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","Thom Jones made his literary debut in The New Yorker in 1991. Within six months his stories appeared in Harper's, Esquire, Mirabella, Story, Buzz, and in The New Yorker twice more. ""The Pugilist at Rest"" - the title story from this stunning collection - took first place in Prize Stories 1993: The O. Henry Awards and was selected for inclusion in Best American Short Stories 1992. He is a writer of astonishing talent. Jones's stories - whether set in the combat zones of Vietnam or the brittle social and intellectual milieu of an elite New England college, whether recounting the poignant last battles of an alcoholic ex-fighter or the hallucinatory visions of an American wandering lost in Bombay in the aftermath of an epileptic fugue - are fueled by an almost brutal vision of the human condition, in a world without mercy or redemption. Physically battered, soul-sick, and morally exhausted, Jones's characters are yet unable to concede defeat: his stories are infused with the improbable grace of the spirit that ought to collapse, but cannot. For in these extraordinary pieces of fiction, it is not goodness that finally redeems us, but the heart's illogical resilience, and the ennobling tenacity with which we cling to each other and to our lives. The publication of The Pugilist at Rest is a major literary event, heralding the arrival of an electrifying new voice in American fiction, and a writer of magnificent depth and range. With these eleven stories, Thom Jones takes his place among the ranks of this country's most important authors.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

This gripping book chronicles the rise of the Bavarian Order of Illuminists, surveying the tumultuous political, social, and religious atmosphere that allowed the organization to take root in the United States.Author Vernon Stauffer characterizes the mood in New England after the Revolutionary War, an atmosphere of religious disaffection and political confusion that fostered the development and spread of panic and hysteria. Stauffer traces the European beginnings of the Bavarian Order of Illuminists and the transmission of its legend across the Atlantic, culminating in the effects of the Illuminati agitation in New England. This strictly factual account incorporates no conjecture and is enhanced by extensive footnotes.

Streatfeild examines the story of cocaine from its first medical uses to the worldwide chaos it causes today.

","Cocaine, writes filmmaker Dominic Streatfeild, ""is not some evil spawn of Satan but simply a commodity."" Like other commodities, cocaine has a history. When the Spanish conquistadors came to South America and observed that Indians who chewed the leaves of Erythroxylon coca could, it seemed, march over the tallest mountain or through the densest forest for days on end, they knew they were onto something. The newcomers took to growing coca themselves, and in time their product found an audience outside the continent, with users such as Sigmund Freud, Ernest Shackleton (who ""took Forced March cocaine tablets to Antarctica in 1909 for the energy boost they gave""), Duke Ellington, and, eventually, half of Hollywood to testify to its powers. Streatfeild's appropriately rapid narrative takes in such key moments and players as ""the year of cocaine"" 1969, when the film Easy Rider reintroduced the drug to American popular culture, and George Jung, whose exploits are chronicled in Ted Demme's film Blow, to create a portrait of the drug that ranges over centuries. Though he supports legalization, Streatfeild acknowledges the evil and corruption surrounding the trade. Drawing lessons from history, he also suggests the possibility that ""cocaine will fizzle out in the year 2015 the way it did in the early twentieth century."" At the close of this absorbing book, he adds, ""It deserves to."" --Gregory McNamee ",Hardcover,,508 pages,"

","This is a true-to-life tale both of and for our times, a story of ambition, of a fall from grace and ultimately of redemption. Katy Hendricks (pseudonym) was the all-American success story. From working class origins in small town Pennsylvania, Katy moved up the ladder to social and academic success in the big city. But behind the facade was an insecure young woman increasingly dependent on alcohol and cocaine. The pressures of academic overachieving exacted a cruel toll.

","Pablo Escobar, king of the Medellin Cartel in Columbia, was the world's richest cocaine baron, with an estimated personal fortune of $5 billion. His forces of hit men became small armies, he had a payroll of judges, politicians, generals and presidents. But Escobar was a wanted man, and nothing could prevent his assassination at the hands of the Columbian police in December 1993. This work paints a complex picture of a man who, although totally ruthless in business, firmly believed that he was working for the good of his country, twice offering to pay off its national debt. Using Escobar's life as a lens through which to focus on the cocaine trade in general, this work examines the corruption behind the legimitate facades of governmental and financial institutions both in columbia and the West.",Hardcover,,,"

","In this exciting collection of lyrical, sensual, and elegant poems, A. S. Maulucci offers romantic readers a fresh take on the sonnet, the time-honored and most elevated form for expressing the mysterious emotion we call love. Two poets have created sonnets which have proved a delight and an inspiration to many. The great Italian Renaissance scholar Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374) wrote several hundred love poems to a woman named Laura and published them in a collection called Canzoniere (""Songbook""). These sonnets seem very modern -- they focus on the psychology of the lover -- and they have had a profound influence on other poets throughout Europe. Similarly, the sonnets of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1904-1973), author of Cien Sonetos de Amor, are filled with sensual imagery, and they are still read and loved around the world. The work of both of these poets became the models for Maulucci's own sonnets. He too wrote most of them for one extraordinary woman.",Kindle Edition,,100 pages,"

","What Makes Sammy Run?Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times—from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York’s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic—his congenital incapacity for friendship.An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick’s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.",Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","The greatest success of the Bavarian Illuminati conspiracy was the French Revolution of 1789. The profound impact of that Revolution is felt to this day in the political destinies of billions of people worldwide. The Illuminati had declared war against Church and State a decade earlier and worked feverishly to spread their new gospel of Liberty and Reason. Although the Order was officially suppressed on the eve of the Revolution, its efforts do not appear to have been in vain. The recruiting program of Illuminati founder Adam Weishaupt was focused on attracting the powerful and influential government ministers, educators, the press, authors and philosophers, booksellers and publishers, even religious leaders open to agnostic or atheist views. Many such men belonged to the masonic lodges of Germany, Austria, and France. The wider masonic network offered Weishaupt a respectable vehicle by which he was able to propagate his clandestine doctrines. What message does the triumph of these secret societies carry for the modern world?English historian Una Birch attempts to answer this question from the point of view of the early twentieth century. Writing just a hundred years after the event, her closeness in time, and sympathy for the Revolution, offer a unique perspective to the modern reader. Editor James Wasserman adds a contemporary perspective that takes into account the events of the twentieth century that occurred after Ms. Birch wrote. He has also added a guide to the history and personalities of the French Revolution to help clarify the text.Reveals the secret activities of the Bavarian Illuminati and the Freemasons in organizing the French Revolution.Traces the influence of the mysterious Illuminati agent, the Comte de Saint Germain, as he traveled through the courts and cities of Europe.Offers a unique perspective on the Revolution by an author who supported the Illuminati war against tyranny and superstition, yet does not shrink from examining the darker side of that event.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","According to David Mamet, a film director must, above all things, think visually. Most of this instructive and funny book is written in dialogue form and based on film classes Mamet taught at Columbia University. He encourages his students to tell their stories not with words, but through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. The best films, Mamet argues, are composed of simple shots. The great filmmaker understands that the burden of cinematic storytelling lies less in the individual shot than in the collective meaning that shots convey when they are edited together. Mamet borrows many of his ideas about directing, writing, and acting from Russian masters such as Konstantin Stanislavsky, Sergei M. Eisenstein, and Vsevelod Pudovkin, but he presents his material in so delightful and lively a fashion that he revitalizes it for the contemporary reader.",Paperback,,107 pages,"

Here and There
 is Levitt’s new collection of personally-selected images a charming monograph featuring over ninety never-before-published photographs, including portraits of her friends James Agee and Walker Evans. The recently discovered photographs featured in 
Here and There
 represent Levitt’s own favorite images selected from her immense private collection. Shot over seven decades, Here and There reveals Levitt’s acute sense of how cosmetically street life has changed—and how substantially it has remained the same. The sheer determination of this inimitable photographer to walk the streets of her beloved city for this length of time and take pictures of what she saw, reaffirms her unofficial status as New York City’s visual poet laureate. “[Levitt’s photographs] have the quality of frozen street-corner conversation: she went out, saw something wonderful, came home to tell you all about it, and then, frustrated, said, ‘You had to be there,’ and you realize, looking at the picture, that you were.” —Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker",Hardcover,,120 pages,"

THE AUTHOR Jim Thompson (1906-1977) was born in Oklahoma. He wrote nearly thirty novels, including The Grifters and The Getaway, which has been filmed twice, and two screenplays for the Stanley Kubrick films The Killing and Paths of Glory.",Paperback,,169 pages,"

","How do we know that Emily Dickinson wrote poems? How do we recognize a poem when we see one? In Dickinson's Misery, Virginia Jackson poses fundamental questions about reading habits we have come to take for granted. Because Dickinson's writing remained largely unpublished when she died in 1886, decisions about what it was that Dickinson wrote have been left to the editors, publishers, and critics who have brought Dickinson's work into public view. The familiar letters, notes on advertising fliers, verses on split-open envelopes, and collections of verses on personal stationery tied together with string have become the Dickinson poems celebrated since her death as exemplary lyrics. Jackson makes the larger argument that the century and a half spanning the circulation of Dickinson's work tells the story of a shift in the publication, consumption, and interpretation of lyric poetry. This shift took the form of what this book calls the ""lyricization of poetry,"" a set of print and pedagogical practices that collapsed the variety of poetic genres into lyric as a synonym for poetry. Featuring many new illustrations from Dickinson's manuscripts, this book makes a major contribution to the study of Dickinson and of nineteenth-century American poetry. It maps out the future for new work in historical poetics and lyric theory.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Black Misery was first published in 1969, but the gentle, funny, and sometimes melancholy words of Langston Hughes still cause a blink of recognition. After 25 years, it remains relevant in our own time. As you turn the pages you may say, ""I remember feeling like that!"" You may say, ""I feel like that now."" As you look at Arouni's black and white illustrations and read the short but powerful one sentence captions, you feel the predicament of a black child adjusting to the new world of integration of the 1960s. You feel the mix of hope and dismay that characterized the decade. Langston Hughes was a writer who often made his readers ask hard questions about life. In Black Misery he wrote about prejudice and indifference, but he wrote with humor and compassion. Today--just as we did 25 years ago-we smile and even laugh, and we also understand that some things are more than hard, are more than sad. They are pure misery. Black Misery was the last book that Langston Hughes wrote. He died in May 1967, while working on the manuscript.",Paperback,,72 pages,"

","Nearly 26,000 men were wounded in the three-day battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863). It didn’t matter if the soldier wore blue or gray or was an officer or enlisted man, for bullets, shell fragments, bayonets, and swords made no class or sectional distinction. Almost 21,000 of the wounded were left behind by the two armies in and around the small town of 2,400 civilians. Most ended up being treated in makeshift medical facilities overwhelmed by the flood of injured. Many of these and their valiant efforts are covered in Greg Coco’s A Vast Sea of Misery: A History and Guide to the Union and Confederate Field Hospitals at Gettysburg, July 1-November 20, 1863.The battle to save the wounded was nearly as terrible as the battle that placed them in such a perilous position. Once the fighting ended, the maimed and suffering warriors could be found in churches, public buildings, private homes, farmhouses, barns, and outbuildings. Thousands more, unreachable or unable to be moved remained in the open, subject to the uncertain whims of the July elements. As one surgeon unhappily recalled, “No written nor expressed language could ever picture the field of Gettysburg! Blood! blood! And tattered flesh! Shattered bones and mangled forms almost without the semblance of human beings!”Based upon years of firsthand research, Coco’s A Vast Sea of Misery introduces readers to 160 of those frightful places called field hospitals. It is a sad journey you will never forget, and you won’t feel quite the same about Gettysburg once you finish reading.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","In this landmark study, John Carey analyzes the elitest views of some of the most highly respected literary icons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This book, as defined in his preface, ""is about the response of the English literary intelligentsia to the new phenomenon of mass culture."" Readers may be shocked to learn that H.G. Wells liked to think that this newly emerged ""mass"" would be eliminated by plague and atomic bombs; that Yeats wished them to perish in an apocalyptic war against the educated classes and that D.H. Lawrence visualized a huge lethal chamber in which they could be exterminated. John Carey's devastating attack on the intellectuals exposes the loathing which the mass of humanity ignited in many of the virtual founders of modern culture: G.B. Shaw, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot and others. Professor Carey compares their detestation of common humanity to Nietzsche, whose philosophy helped create the atmosphere leading to the rise of Adolph Hitler. Any student of modern literature and history will find John Carey's incisive book both enlightening and disturbing, an essential read for a full understanding of where we are today.",Paperback,,246 pages,"

","Set against the turbulent decades of the 1930s, '40s, and '50s, this absorbing biography of the much-neglected intellectual Granville Hicks unfolds in the age of rising fascism, the Great Depression, leftist politics, World War II, the Cold War, McCarthyism, and American anti-intellectualism. Born in 1901 in Exeter, New Hampshire, Hicks was greatly influenced by the New England tradition of moral consciousness and political idealism. The authors trace his career as a journalist for The New Masses, his tumultuous relationship with communism, his struggle with the request to name names before the House Un-American Activities Committee, and his return to small-town life. Hick's remarkable writing career with The New Leader and the Saturday Review are closely studied, along with his pioneering works on American and British literature. The biography places this giant of modern literature and criticism among the remarkable generation of writers that included Edmund Wilson, Malcolm Cowley, John Steinbeck, and Alfred Kazin, and marks his influence on the early career of Flannery O'Connor, Bernard Malamud, and others.",Hardcover,,303 pages,"

","""The most powerful challenge to be mounted against the principles of popular environmentalism in the last fifteen years.""--The Washington Post Book World (on the first edition)Arguing that the ultimate resource is the human imagination coupled to the human spirit, Julian Simon has led a vigorous challenge to conventional beliefs about scarcity of energy and natural resources, pollution of the environment, the effects of immigration, and the ""perils of overpopulation."" The comprehensive data, careful quantitative research, and economic logic contained in the first edition of The Ultimate Resource questioned widely held professional judgments about the threat of overpopulation, and Simon's celebrated bet with Paul Ehrlich about resource prices in the 1980s enhanced the public attention--both pro and con--that greeted this controversial book.Now Princeton University Press presents a revised and expanded edition of The Ultimate Resource. The new volume is thoroughly updated and provides a concise theory for the observed trends: Population growth and increased income put pressure on supplies of resources. This increases prices, which provides opportunity and incentive for innovation. Eventually the innovative responses are so successful that prices end up below what they were before the shortages occurred. The book also tackles timely issues such as the supposed rate of species extinction, the ""vanishing farmland crisis, "" and the wastefulness of coercive recycling.In Simon's view, the key factor in natural and world economic growth is our capacity for the creation of new ideas and contributions to knowledge. The more people alive who can be trained to help solve the problems that confrontus, the faster we can remove obstacles, and the greater the economic inheritance we shall bequeath to our descendants. In conjunction with the size of the educated population, the key constraint on human progress is the nature of the economic-political system: talented people need economic freedom and security to bring their talents to fruition.",Paperback,,778 pages,"

","Richard Pipes, Harvard scholar and historian of the Russian Revolution, brings his remarkable erudition to an exploration of a wide range of national and political systems to demonstrate persuasively that private ownership has served over the centuries to limit the power of the state and enable democratic institutions to evolve and thrive in the Western world.Beginning with Greece and Rome, where the concept of private property as we understand it first developed, Pipes then shows us how, in the late medieval period, the idea matured with the expansion of commerce and the rise of cities. He contrasts England, a country where property rights and parliamentary government advanced hand-in-hand, with Russia, where restrictions on ownership have for centuries consistently abetted authoritarian regimes; finally he provides reflections on current and future trends in the United States. Property and Freedom is a brilliant contribution to political thought and an essential work on a subject of vital importance.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

      Property and Freedom: Constitution, the Courts and Land-Use Regulation
",Bernard Siegan,"

    reviews
","Over the past few years, a series of Supreme Court decisions has strengthened the legal protection of private property in the United States by limiting the power of state and local governments to impose zoning ordinances and land-use regulations on property owners. Bernard H. Siegan explores this new direction of the Supreme Court in Property and Freedom: The Constitution, the Courts, and Land-Use Regulation, arguing that this recent jurisprudence implements the objectives of the framers of the original Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment.Discussing several key land-use cases, Siegan describes the emergence of a new standard of review for land-use regulations--a standard under which a regulation will be held to be constitutional only when it substantially advances state interests and does not deny an owner economically viable use of his land. This new standard is less demanding than the strict scrutiny test applied to laws limiting freedom of speech or of the press, but considerably more demanding than the standard previously applied in these cases. In elevating the protection of property rights, Siegan contends, the Supreme Court has implemented a fundamental rule of fairness: governments should not force individual property owners to bear the costs of regulations which are supposed to benefit the public.Siegan believes that the new standard of review for land-use regulations accords with the widely held view that the protection of property rights is essential to the viability of the state and the well-being of the people. He cites studies showing that economic regulations seriously limit a nation's productivity and standard of living, and that zoning and no-growth measures reduce housing opportunities and raise the price of housing. Understandably, Siegan notes, people with low and moderate incomes tend to vote against zoning regulations in local elections.",Hardcover,,291 pages,"

While his machinations may border on the Rube Goldberg-esque, it is among Brown's missions to present the best - and often the simplest - tool to get the job done. Following an introduction that discusses a little bit of kitchen history and some advice on room layout and organization, the book is divided into 9 chapters: Big Things with Plugs, Pots and Pans, Sharp Things, The Tool Box, Small Things with Plugs, Storage and Containment, It Came From the Hardware Store, Surfaces, and Safety and Sanitation.",Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","A special two-book set exclusively available to Amazon.com customers: two bestselling favorites from Alton Brown, star of Food Network's Good Eats and the new series Feasting on Asphalt.In his best-selling first book, Food Network star Alton Brown described what happens when food meets heat. Now Alton is back and ready to revolutionize the world of baking--and more. Breads, cakes, cookies, pies, custards, ice creams: the popular host of Good Eats explores the science behind our favorite sweets and savories-explaining it all in his own inimitable style.The book opens with a complete encyclopedia of the core ingredients or ""the molecular pantry""-what they are, what they do, and how they play together (or don't). The main part of the book is divided by mixing method: Biscuit, Creaming, Muffin, Straight Dough, Modified Dough, Eggfoam, Custards, and a section called As Well As . . . , which includes such specialized methods as crepes, popovers, mousse, and doughnuts. To underscore the importance-and ease-of mastering the mixing techniques, the book features a special design that adds a half-page flap to the opening page of each mixing section. Printed on the flap is the master mixing technique to serve as a ready reference for each recipe that follows in that section.The more than 80 recipes cover all the basics any baked-good lover could covet, from pie crust to funnel cake to homemade Pop Tarts to cheese soufflé. Select master recipes feature variations that underscore the effects of altering ingredient ratios or preparation methods. The classic chocolate chip cookie, for example, can be interpreted in soft, chewy, and crispy consistencies.At 304 pages, the trivia-filled tome also contains all the fun components Brown fans have come to expect: fact-packed sidebars, intricate illustrations, glossaries, appendices, equipment lists-the works. It's everything readers have been waiting for . . . and more! Alton Brown is the writer, director, and host of the popular Food Network television program Good Eats. His first book, I'm Just Here For the Food, received the 2003 James Beard Foundation KitchenAid Book Award for Best Reference Book. His second book, Alton Brown's Gear For Your Kitchen, was nominated for both a James Beard and an IACP cookbook award.  Dedicated viewers of Alton Brown's acclaimed Food Network show Good Eats know of his penchant for using unusual equipment. He has smoked a salmon in a cardboard box, roasted prime rib in a flowerpot, and used a C-clamp as a nutcracker.Brown isn't interested in novelty, he's just devoted to using the best-and simplest-tool for the job. Alton Brown's Gear For Your Kitchen offers honest, practical advice on what's needed and what isn't, what works and what doesn't. His advice: You only need three knives, but they are a lifetime investment. And don't bother with that famous countertop grill--it doesn't get hot enough to properly sear.In his signature science-guy style, Brown begins with advice on kitchen layout and organization, then gets to the lowdown on these cooking elements: Big Things with Plugs; Pots and Pans; Sharp Things; The Tool Box; Small Things with Plugs; Storage and Containment; and Safety and Sanitation. Along the way he delves deep into kitchen science and appliance history and legend. Included are 25 brand-new recipes that employ featured gear.Alton Brown's Gear For Your Kitchen is essential for all of his fans--and anyone who wants a good guide to great kitchen gear.",Hardcover,,0 pages,"

","Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as ""a minor masterpiece"" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as ""molecular gastronomy."" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are:Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food qualityThe great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredientsTips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfullyThe particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasureOur evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foodsOn Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.",Hardcover,"Revised, Second Edition",896 pages,"

","The dark, devastating stranger rode into the village fair and wagered twenty pounds at the throwing booth — for a chance to win the daisies in Viola Thornhill’s hair. The Gypsy fortune teller had warned: “Beware of a tall, dark, handsome stranger. He can destroy you — if you do not first snare his heart.”Recklessly Viola flirted, then danced with him around the Maypole. And then came his delicate, delicious kiss. Viola did not regret that she had let down her guard — until the next morning, when he appeared at her door to claim her beloved Pinewood Manor. Lord Ferdinand Dudley won her home in a game of cards!Viola hated him for trying to take everything, including her soul. She was mistress of Pinewood Manor. Yet Dudley refused to leave, even as his conscience rebelled at compromising this beautiful innocent whose only proof of ownership was a dead earl’s promise. Dudley held the deed, but at what cost? Each day under the same roof brought its share of temptation, intimacy, and guilt. But Viola knew it was a battle she could not afford to lose. Marriage was out of the question, and she would be no man’s mistress. Even as Dudley’s unnerving presence, his knowing smile, threatened to melt her resolve.Against his better judgment, Lord Ferdinand Dudley was beguiled. This maddening beauty had stirred him as no woman had before. And he was bound and determined to make her his own.",Mass Market Paperback,,384 pages,"

Drawing on the diaries, letters, and memoirs of hundreds of planter wives and daughters, Clinton sets before us in vivid detail the daily life of the plantation mistress and her ambiguous intermediary position in the hierarchy between slave and master.""The Plantation Mistress challenges and reinterprets a host of issues related to the Old South. The result is a book that forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about two peculiar institutions -- the slave plantation and the nineteenth-century family. It approaches a familiar subject from a new angle, and as a result, permanently alters our understanding of the Old South and women's place in it.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","After a year of grand adventures touring the classical ruins of Italy and Greece, Iphiginia Bright returned to England to discover that the real excitement was at home. It seems that her Aunt Zoe has fallen victim to a sinister blackmailer and only Iphiginia can hope to stop the culprit before he can do more harm. Her plan is inspired: Imitating history's most legendary beauties--Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Aphrodite--the former schoolmistress will remake herself, and descend upon London Society as the dazzling mistress of Marcus Valerius Cloud, the infamous Earl of Masters. Rumors hint that the Earl has disappeared at the blackmailer's hands, and by posing as his unknown mistress, Iphiginia is convinced she can ferret out the villain. Overnight, Iphiginia is transformed into a vision with a host of eager admirers, including one she does not expect -- the Earl of Masters himself, who strides into a shimmering ballroom one evening to cooly reclaim his ""mistress"". He is everything they say he is... arrogant, attractive, devastatingly seductive, and Iphiginia can't help but be enthralled. But when Marcus agrees to play along with her charade, she doesn't know that the determined earl has plans of his own: to tease and tempt her, until the beautiful deceiver becomes more than his mistress in name only.",Mass Market Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Born into poverty and raised in a brothel, Nell Gwynne sells oranges in the pit at London’s King’s Theater, newly reopened after the plague and the Great Fire devastated the city. Soon, her quick sense of humor and natural charm get her noticed by those who have the means to make her life easier. But the street-smart Nell knows a woman doesn’t get ahead by selling her body. Through talent, charm, intelligence, and sheer determination—as well as a keen understanding of how the world operates—Nell works her way out of the pit and onto the stage to become the leading comedic actress of the day. Her skills and beauty quickly win the attention of all of London—eventually even catching the eye of King Charles II. Their attraction is as real as it is unlikely, and the scrappy orange girl with the pretty face and the quick wit soon finds herself plunged into the confusing and dangerous world of the court, where she learns there are few she can trust—and many whom she cannot turn her back on.From the gritty streets of seventeenth-century London, to the backstage glamour of its theaters, to the glittering court of Charles II, The Perfect Royal Mistress is a love story for the ages, the rags-to-riches tale of a truly remarkable heroine.",Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Peggy Guggenheim emerges in Mistress of Modernism as the ultimate self-invented woman, a cultural mover and shaker who broke away from her poor-little-rich-girl origins to shape a life for herself as the enfant terrible of the art world. Peggy's visionary Art of This Century gallery in New York, which brought together the European surrealist artists with the American abstract expressionists, was an epoch-shaking ""happening"" at the center of its time. Dearborn's unprecedented access to the Guggenheim family, friends, and papers contributes rich insight to Peggy's traumatic childhood in German-Jewish ""Our Crowd"" New York, her self-education in the ways of art and artists, her caustic battles with other art-collecting Guggenheims, and her legendary sexual appetites: her lovers included Max Ernst, Samuel Beckett, and Marcel Duchamp, to name a mere few. Here too is a poignant portrait of Peggy's last years as l'ultima dogaressa -- the last duchess -- in her palazzo in Venice, where her collection still draws thousands of visitors every year. Mistress of Modernism is the first definitive biography of a woman whose wit, passion, and provocative legacy come compellingly to life.",Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","”Music is my mistress, and she plays second fiddle to no one.” This is the story of Duke Ellington—the story of Jazz itself. Told in his own way, in his own words, a symphony written by the King of Jazz. His story spans and defines a half-century of modern music.This man who created over 1500 compositions was as much at home in Harlem's Cotton Club in the ‘20s as he was at a White House birthday celebration in his honor in the ‘60s. For Duke knew everyone and savored them all. Passionate about his music and the people who made music, he counted as his friends hundreds of the musicians who changed the face of music throughout the world: Bechet, Basie, Armstrong, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Sinatra, to name a few of them. Here are 100 photographs to give us an intimate view of Duke's world—his family, his friends, his associates.What emerges most strongly in his commitment to music, the mistress for whom he saves the fullest intensity of his passion. ”Lovers have come and gone, but only my mistress stays,” he says. He composed not only songs that all the world has sung, but also suites, sacred works, music for stage and screen and symphonies. This rich book, the embodiment of the life and works of the Duke, is replete with appendices listing singers, arrangers, lyricists and the symphony orchestras with whom the Duke played. There is a book to own and cherish by all who love Jazz and the contributions made to it by the Duke.",Paperback,,544 pages,"

Born during a tumultuous period in England’s past, Nell Gwyn caught the eye of King Charles II, the newly restored, pleasure-seeking “merry monarch” of a nation in full hedonistic reaction to Puritan rule. Their seventeen-year love affair played out against the backdrop of the Great Fire of London, the Great Plague, court scandals, and the constant threat of political revolution. Despite his other lovers’ Machiavellian efforts to win the king’s favor and humiliate Nell, the self-proclaimed “Protestant whore” earned the devotion of her king and the love of her nation, becoming England’s first “people’s princess.” Magnificently recreating the heady and licentious, yet politically charged atmosphere of Restoration England, Nell Gwyn tells the true-life Cinderella story of a common orange salesgirl who became mistress to a king.",Paperback,,448 pages,"

","Considered by many scholars to be among the most brilliant novels written in French during the eighteenth century, Lettres de Mistriss Henley publiees par son amie was composed as a response to Samuel de Constant's misogynist novel, The Sentimental Husband (1783). Charriere presents six letters penned by a Mistriss Henley, who has chosen a decent and affectionate man as her life's companion only to discover that she cannot bear sharing his life. An immediate success on its publication in 1784, Mistriss Henley was greeted with acclaim and controversy: one reader called the book ""literarily excellent"" but ""morally dangerous in various ways."" Remarkable for its empathy for both spouses, Mistriss Henley is not only a moving work of fiction but also one of the most modern novels of its day.",Paperback,,42 pages,"

Why then, does our society still behave as if marital infidelity were some unfathomable aberration?Mythology is rich with mistresses-- both divine and mortal--some who have played their roles cunningly and to perfection, and some who have destroyed themselves and all around them. Famous mistresses have not only graced literature but have written it. Courtesans have been a feature of royal courts throughout history. And, whether or not we admit it, or feign nave ignorance, mistresses are women we know, here and now.Victoria Griffin, herself a mistress, brings her steady yet startling focus on the mistresses in history and culture, past and present: from Camille Claudel to Monica Lewinsky, from Madame de Pompadour to Simone de Beauvoir, from George Eliot to Pamela Harriman. It is a subject as rich and diverse as history itself, alive with memorable characters. The Mistress will provoke and delight in equal measure.",Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","      Marli Weiner challenges much of the received wisdom on the domestic realm         of the nineteenth-century southern plantation--a world in which white         mistresses and female slaves labored together to provide food, clothing,         and medicines to the larger plantation community. Although divided by         race, black and white women were joined by common female experiences and         expectations of behavior. Because work and gender affected them as much         as race, mistresses and female slaves interacted with one another very         differently from the ways they interacted with men.       Supported by the women's own words, Weiner offers fresh interpretations         of the ideology of domesticity that influenced women's race relations         before the Civil War, the gradual manner in which they changed during         the war, and the harsher behaviors that resulted during Reconstruction.       A volume in the series Women in American History, edited by Anne Firor         Scott, Nancy A. Hewitt, and Stephanie Shaw  ",Paperback,,328 pages,"

","Originally published nearly 40 years ago, this gothic classic has been frightening, romancing, and winning fans ever since. Part Jane Eyre, part Rebecca and all good, clean, campy fun, Mistress of Mellyn will keep you tearing through the pages, and looking for copies to lend out to friends. Our heroine Martha Leigh is a prim and freshly minted governess who has been hired by the remote and demanding Connan TreMellyn to care for his daughter Alvean. As the departure of the three prior governesses suggests, Alvean is a difficult charge, though understandably so since the recent death of her mother, Alice. As Martha tries to connect with Alvean, she researches the history of Mellyn, and discovers hidden family secrets that still haunt the present. Now familiar with Alvean, she feels herself falling for Connan. Though the desire between Martha and Connan grows, Alice's tragic death continues to haunt them both and endanger any future they may have. A delightful combination of highbrow writing and lowbrow sentiments, Mistress of Mellyn is a guilt-free treat you can indulge in. The romance, suspense, and mystery tromp across the pages with predictable frequency, and there are enough dark looks and dark corridors for any gothic fan. --Nancy R.E.

","In this sequel to the best-selling The American Reader, mother-and-son team Diane and Michael Ravitch have gathered together the best and most memorable poems, essays, songs, and orations in English history, capturing in one compact volume writings that have shaped not only England, but democratic culture around the globe.  Here are words that changed the world, words that inspired revolutions as well as lovers, dreamers, and singers, words that every educated person once knew--and should know today. Framed by two inspiring speeches--Queen Elizabeth before the invasion of the Spanish Armada and Winston Churchill during the dark days of World War II--the book features work by William Wordsworth and W.H. Auden, Thomas Hobbes and John Stuart Mill, Mary Wollstonecraft and Virginia Woolf, Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear, and many other extraordinary writers. Readers will find ardent love poems such as Marlowe's ""The Passionate Shepherd To His Love"" and Shakespeare's ""Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?"" We also find more philosophical works such as Yeat's ""The Second Coming"" and Matthew Arnold's ""Dover Beach."" There are excerpts from Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin, Walter Pater and John Ruskin, Edmund Burke and Thomas Carlyle, and other influential thinkers. In addition, the book includes song lyrics ranging from ""Greensleeves"" to ""Rule, Britannia,"" and works that, though not considered classics, were immensely popular in their day and capture the spirit of an era, such as W.E. Henley's ""Invictus"" (""I am the master of my fate: / I am the captain of my soul""). The editors also provide brief, fascinating biographies of each writer. An exquisite gift, The English Reader offers the best of the best--the soaring language and seminal ideas that fired the imagination of the English-speaking world.",Hardcover,,512 pages,"

","Since its publication in 1959,  A Separate Peace has acquired the reputation of a minor classic of American literature. This insightful analysis helps young readers relate to the themes of disillusionment, guilt and betrayal, and the fear of failure and intergenerational conflicts experienced by the teenaged characters in the novel. This casebook also situates A Separate Peace against the backdrop of World War II, enabling students to see the connections between the fictional world of the novel and the real World as it existed for young people. Moving well beyond a standard literary treatment, this interdisciplinary casebook provides a collection of historical primary documents drawn from official records, War Department orders, institutional histories, personal memoirs and letters, and poignant interviews.With commentary by Knowles himself, the casebook takes readers from the prep school setting of the novel to the impact of wartime on American students and their schools. You're in the Army Now explores the difficult transitions through induction and military training. The Combat Zone graphically confronts the realities of war with interviews of two former P.O.W.'s who experienced firsthand the terrors and tragedies of WWII. The volume also examines some of the contemporary issues of the novel including current controversies in athletic programs, gender issues in education, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Teachers and librarians will find helpful suggestions for oral discussion, research projects, and further suggested readings on these important topics.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Long narrative poem originally titled Commedia (about 1555 printed as La divina commedia) written about 1310-14 by Dante. The work is divided into three major sections--Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso--which trace the journey of a man from darkness and error to the revelation of the divine light, culminating in the beatific vision of God. It is usually held to be one of the world's greatest works of literature. The plot of The Divine Comedy is simple: a man is miraculously enabled to visit the souls in Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. He has two guides: Virgil, who leads him through the Inferno and Purgatorio, and Beatrice, who introduces him to Paradiso. Through these fictional encounters taking place from Good Friday evening in 1300 through Easter Sunday and slightly beyond, Dante the character learns of the exile that is awaiting him (an actual exile that had already occurred at the time of writing). This device allowed Dante not only to create a story out of his exile but also to explain how he came to cope with personal calamity and to offer suggestions for the resolution of Italy's troubles as well.",Hardcover,,384 pages,"

Botticelli gave stunning visual form to the poet's epic journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, but the project was never completed and the sheets were scattered. Now, more than 500 years after their creation, all 91 existing -- and very fragile -- vellum sheets will be shown together for the first time, in Berlin, Rome, and London. This book, which accompanies the exhibition, illustrates each of Botticelli's canto sheets in superb color, faced by a commentary on Botticelli's pictorial response to Dante's poem by Hein-Thomas Schulze Altcappenberg of the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, where 84 of the sheets are permanently housed.

","Senior business leaders to junior employees-everyone is seeking balance, meaning and joy in their career and life. Rather than faddish corporate fluff, ""Build Your Castles in the Air"" provides a business improvement philosophy ringing true to the soul, resonating with values inherent in us all. Author Chuck Hansen applies quotes from Henry David Thoreau's timeless masterpiece ""Walden"" to the most vexing dilemmas of the 21st Century corporate world, and adds reflections from Hansen's own experiences, in national politics, Fortune 500 companies, living in the Caribbean and crossing the North Atlantic in a sailboat. The whole is a simple yet powerful reference tool, containing enduring wisdom, humor, hope, and, moreover, a means to integrate purpose, integrity and authenticity into modern life.

","In this up-to-date and engaging tour of Spain through the ages, one of the world's leading authorities on the history of Spain, Sir Raymond Carr, provides an authoritative overview of a country that has played a vital role in the history of the Western world. He tells of prehistoric Spain and of the imposition of Roman rule, which created the idea of Hispania as a single entity. There are knowledgeable discussions of the Visigoth monarchy, Moorish Spain, the establishment of an empire, and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. Carr examines not only the political and economic development of Spain, but also the extraordinary artistic and literary achievements of the Spanish people. He charts the rise and fall of liberalism in the nineteenth century, and the subsequent period of political instability culminating in the Civil War and authoritarian rule. The book concludes with a look at modern Spain as a fully integrated and enthusiastic member of the European community. Attractively illustrated throughout, Spain: A History is the best historical account of Spain currently available for general readers.",Paperback,,335 pages,"

","s/t: Why It Has Always Failed and Why It Will Fail AgainAlthough terrorism seems a relatively modern phenomenon, novelist and military historian Caleb Carr illustrates that it has been a constant of military history. In ancient times, warring armies raped and slaughtered civilians and gratuitously destroyed homes and cities; in the Middle Ages, evangelical Muslims and Christian crusaders spread their faiths by the sword; and in the early modern era, such celebrated kings as Louis XIV victimized noncombatants for political purposes.During the Civil War Americans first engaged in ""Total war,"" the most egregious of the many euphemisms for the tactics of terror. The forces of the South tried to systematize this horrifying practice; but it fell to a Union general, William Tecumseh Sherman, to achieve that dubious goal. Carr recounts Sherman's declaration of war on every man, woman, and child in the South -- a policy that brought long-term unrest tot he American South by giving birth to the Ku Klux Klan. Carr's exploration of terror reveals its consistently self-defeating nature. Far from prompting submission, Carr argues, terrorism stiffens enemy resolve: for this reason above all, terrorism has never achieved -- not will it ever achieve -- long-term success, however physically destructive and psychologically debilitating it may become. With commanding authority and the storyteller's gift for which he is renowned, Caleb Carr provides a critical historical context for understanding terrorist acts today, arguing that terrorism will be eradicated only when it is perceived as a tactic that brings nothing save defeat to its agents.",Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","This book will acquaint you with the near magical possibilities of a tax-saving, income-producing legal device known as a ""charitable remainder trust"" or ""CRT."" Although ""CRT"" is the currently popular term, these trusts are also known as ""life income"" and ""wealth accumulation"" trusts. Both descriptions are accurate - and therein lies the money magic. A CRT is just the thing for a person who wants to avoid capital gains taxes on appreciated property, in pursuit of increased retirement income or seeking estate tax relief. But this trust is also the perfect vehicle to achieve your personal philanthropic goals, while also helping yourself and your family. In fact, while tax savings and income enhancement are central attractions of the CRT, the chief motivation should be the settlor/ donor's charitable intentions. After all, when the final distribution of trust assets is made - and they can have considerable value - the charity of your choice will be the major beneficiary. In the meantime, there is no reason why the objects of your generosity cannot reward their benefactor with a seat on your church board of trustees, or your alma mater's establishment of a scholarship bearing your name. Here is what the creation of a CRT can accomplish for you. Properly drafted, formulated and managed, a charitable remainder trust is an excellent ""transfer tax"" avoidance instrumentality that can: . avoid completely any capital gains tax payment on your appreciated property, regardless of the original cost basis; . convert your low-yield property into a high income investment guaranteed to provide you and your spouse the financial security of lifetime income, immediate or deferred, with greatly reduced income tax consequences; . serve as a vehicle to receive the ""roll over"" of your qualified pension plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA), increasing both retirement income and tax savings; . provide you with an immediate substantial charitable income tax deduction against your taxes for the year in which the CRT is created; . diminish estate and inheritance taxes on the donated property - and avoid the probate mess as well; and . for your heirs, provide a greatly increased inheritance, financed by the tax savings and increased income your CRT will provide. Sounds too good to be true - or to be legal in present day, tax oppressed America? Believe us, it is true.",Paperback,,48 pages,"

","Separated by millennia, Aristotle and Sigmund Freud gave us disparate but compelling pictures of the human condition. But if, with Jonathan Lear, we scrutinize these thinkers' attempts to explain human behavior in terms of a higher principle--whether happiness or death--the pictures fall apart. Aristotle attempted to ground ethical life in human striving for happiness, yet he didn't understand what happiness is any better than we do. Happiness became an enigmatic, always unattainable, means of seducing humankind into living an ethical life. Freud fared no better when he tried to ground human striving, aggression, and destructiveness in the death drive, like Aristotle attributing purpose where none exists. Neither overarching principle can guide or govern ""the remainder of life,"" in which our inherently disruptive unconscious moves in breaks and swerves to affect who and how we are. Lear exposes this tendency to self-disruption for what it is: an opening, an opportunity for new possibilities. His insights have profound consequences not only for analysis but for our understanding of civilization and its discontent.",Paperback,,204 pages,"

","The name Hershey evokes many things: chocolate bars, the company town in Pennsylvania, one of America's most recognizable brands. But who was the man behind the name? In this compelling biography, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael D'Antonio gives us the real-life rags-to-riches story of Milton S. Hershey, a largely uneducated businessman whose idealistic sense of purpose created an immense financial empire, a town, and a legacy that lasts to this day.  Hershey, the son of a minister's daughter and an irresponsible father who deserted the family, began his career inauspiciously when the two candy shops he opened both went bankrupt. Undeterred, he started the Lancaster Caramel Company, which brought him success at last. Eventually he sold his caramel operation and went on to perfect the production process of chocolate to create a stable, consistent bar with a long shelf life...and an American icon was born.  Hershey was more than a successful businessman -- he was a progressive thinker who believed in capitalism as a means to higher goals. He built the world's largest chocolate factory and a utopian village for his workers on a large tract of land in rural Pennsylvania, and used his own fortune to keep his workers employed during the Great Depression. In addition, he secretly willed his fortune to a boys' school and orphanage, both of which now control a vast endowment.  Extensively researched and vividly written, Hershey is the fascinating story of this uniquely American visionary.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Rooke was the first writer to lay down the rules of marginal cost as a universal principle, came closer than other writers to the correct distinction between profits and interest, and pointed out the mistake of speaking of a general rate of profits as a return for capital. Rooke also provided acute criticism of of the historical portion of the Ricardian theory of rent as well as of Ricardo's neglect of temporary and incidental (as opposed to permanent and abstract) causes in the settlement of the money problem. Rooke's entire work is based on the ""fundamental proposition that the formation of capital is continually accumulating new stores of wealth, and thereby, cheapening the means of living."" E.R.A.

","How does the notion of colorblind equality fit with the social and economic realities of black Americans? Challenging the increasingly popular argument that blacks should settle down, stop whining, and get jobs, Skin Trade insists that racism remains America's premier national story and its grossest national product. From Aunt Jemima Pancakes to ethnic Barbie dolls, corporate America peddles racial and gender stereotypes, packaging and selling them to us as breakfast food or toys for our kids.Moving from the realm of child's play through the academy and the justice system, Ann duCille draws on icons of popular culture to demonstrate that it isn't just race and gender that matter in America but race and gender as reducible to skin color, body structure, and other visible signs of difference. She reveals that Mattel, Inc., uses stereotypes of gender, race, and cultural difference to mark--and market--its Barbie dolls as female, white, black, Asian, and Hispanic. The popularity of these dolls suggests the degree to which we have internalized dominant definitions of self and other.In a similar move, Skin Trade interrogates the popular discourse surrounding the trial of O. J. Simpson, arguing that much of the mainstream coverage of the case was a racially coded message equally dependent on stereotypes. Focusing on Newsweek and Time in particular, duCille shows how the former All-American was depicted as un-American. She explores other collusions and collisions among race, gender, and capital as well. Especially concerned with superficial distinctions perpetuated within the academic community, the author argues that the academy indulges in its own skin trade in which both race and gender are hot properties.By turns biting, humorous, and hopeful, Skin Trade is always riveting, full of strange connections and unexpected insights.",Paperback,,211 pages,"

His technique is impressionistic, piling on the sights and smells and sounds experience by one rough-and-tumble Welsh lad with miraculous awareness of the wonder of things. Throughout his short life, Dylan Thomas dipped continually into his own childhood for his poetry.Thomas' hilarious, semi-autobiographical novel Adventures in the Skin Trade about a young man's first trip to the big city was recorded at the Poetry Center of the 92nd Street YM-YWHA in New York City.This audio reproduces the full sound spectrum of the historic recordings; it has been remastered using contemprary digital equipment. ",audio cassette,,0 pages,"

","WARNING:This is not a cookbook. You'll find no tongue-tempting treats within -- unless, of course, you consider Boiled Cow Elbow with Plaid Sauce to be your idea of a tasty meal. No, The Gallery of Regrettable Food is a public service. Learn to identify these dishes. Learn to regard shivering liver molds with suspicion. Learn why curries are a Communist plot to undermine decent, honest American spices. Learn to heed the advice of stern, fictional nutritionists. If you see any of these dishes, please alert the authorities.Now, the good news: laboratory tests prove that The Gallery of Regrettable Food AMUSES as well as informs. Four out of five doctors recommend this book for its GENEROUS PORTIONS OF HILARITY and ghastly pictures from RETRO COOKBOOKS. You too will look at these products of post-war cuisine and ask: ""WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?"" It's an affectionate look at the days when starch ruled, pepper was a dangerous spice, and Stuffed Meat with Meat Sauce was considered health food.Bon appetit!The Gallery of Regrettable Food is a simple introduction to poorly photographed foodstuffs and horrid recipes from the Golden Age of Salt and Starch. It's a wonder anyone in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s gained any weight. It isn't that the food was inedible; it was merely dull. Everything was geared toward a timid palate fearful of spice. It wasn't nonnutritious -- no, between the limp boiled vegetables, fat-choked meat cylinders, and pink whipped Jell-O desserts, you were bound to find a few calories that would drag you into the next day. It's just that the pictures are so hideously unappealing.Author James Lileks has made it his life's work to unearth the worst recipes and food photography from that bygone era and assemble them with hilarious, acerbic commentary: ""This is not meat. This is something they scraped out of the air filter from the engines of the Exxon Valdez."" It all started when he went home to Fargo and found an ancient recipe book in his mom's cupboard: Specialties of the House, from the North Dakota State Wheat Commission. He never looked back. Now, they're not really recipe books. They're ads for food companies, with every recipe using the company's products, often in unexpected and horrifying ways. There's not a single appetizing dish in the entire collection.The pictures in the book are ghastly -- the Italian dishes look like a surgeon had a sneezing fit during an operation, and the queasy casseroles look like something on which the janitor dumps sawdust. But you have to enjoy the spirit behind the books -- cheerful postwar perfect housewifery, and folks with the guts to undertake such culinary experiments as stuffing cabbage with hamburger, creating the perfect tongue mousse when you have the fellas over for a pregame nosh, or, best of all, baking peppers with a creamy marshmallow sauce. Alas, too many of these dishes bring back scary childhood memories.",Hardcover,1st Edition,192 pages,"

","Don’t throw out the baby with the bathwater!Ahhhh, the 1940s and ’50s . . . a time when parents everywhere strove for the American Dream—manicured lawns, a shiny car in the driveway, and perfect children playing in the yard. Raising kids was simpler back then, or was it?In Mommy Knows Worst, you’ll be treated to a visual feast of past parenting neuroses—as well as insight into why concerned moms and dads were driven to buy “delicious” baby laxatives, douse their baby in oil and put him in the sun, and strap Junior into a car seat that bore a strange resemblance to scrap metal. If you’re a baby boomer who lived through this childhood torture, well, we’re sorry. But if humor really is the best medicine (rather than bicarbonate of curd and mustard plaster, as was previously recommended for childhood ailments), then Mommy Knows Worst  is cheaper than therapy.Photographs, advertisements, magazine articles, and government-issue parenting guides, which seemed so helpful in their day, are given a whole new slant by the master of the genre, James Lileks. Mommy Knows Worst  is a rollicking tribute to old-fashioned parenting that gives us a whole new reason not to forget our past—it’s hilarious!",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","Warning! This book is not to be used in any way, shape, or form as a design manual. Rather, like the documentary about youth crime “Scared Straight,” it is meant as a caution of sorts, a warning against any lingering nostalgia we may have for the 1970s, a breathtakingly ugly period when even the rats parted their hair down the middle. (Please note that the author and publisher are not responsible for the results of viewing these pictures.)James Lileks came of age in the 1970s, and for him there was no crueler thing you could inflict upon a person. The music: either sluggish metal, cracker-boogie, or wimpy ballads. Television: camp without the pleasure of knowing it’s camp. Politics: the sweaty perfidy of Nixon, the damp uselessness of Ford, the sanctimonious impotence of Carter. The world: nasty. Hair: unspeakable. Architecture: metal-shingled mansard roofs on franchise chicken shops. No oil. No fun. Syphilis and Fonzie.Interior Desecrations is the author’s revenge on the decade. Using an ungodly collection of the worst of 1970s interior design magazines, books, and pamphlets, he proves without a shadow of a doubt that the ’70s were a hideously grim period. This is what happens when Dad drinks, Mom floats in a Valium haze, the kids slump down in the den with a bong, and the decorator is left to run amok. It seemed so normal at the time. But this book should cure whatever lingering nostalgia we have. So adjust your sense of style, color, and taste. beware! You’ve been warned.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

Worst of all, he loses his job as the local society columnist when he inadvertently libels an entire townful of elderly Scandinavian housewives.

Con un tono mordaz, agudo e irreverente, este pensador también se aproxima a los más trascendentales temas que atañen a la reflexión filosófica y teológica. Es la diosa Estulticia (necedad) la protagonista de su libro, es ella quien habla, aparentemente en contra de la razón, pues, ¿quién mejor que Stultitia está en capacidad de señalar y penetrar las distintas máscaras que los hombres adoptan durante su existencia? Así que este libro, por una parte acomete con rigor serias discusiones filosóficas y teológicas, y, por otra parte, las presenta en una especie de comedia y sátira con rasgos de novela, tan exitosamente que Erasmo tuvo que autorizar siete ediciones tan sólo en los primeros meses de su aparición.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

The Barnes & Noble Review
December 1998  The New York Times Book Review declared Jonathan Harr's revealing true story, A Civil Action, ""a page-turner. So rich and vivid that it becomes a good deal more than a simple, interesting case study."" The critically acclaimed bestseller tells the true story of an obsessed young lawyer who gives up just about everything to fight two prestigious law firms and two of the nation's largest corporations on behalf of the families and citizens of Woburn, Massachusetts, whose loved ones died because they drank the water. Harr has crafted a tale that demonstrates how truth can be more interesting than fiction. Describing a lawsuit that lasted nine years, A Civil Action reveals that even with the best lawyers and evidence on the victims' side, justice can be elusive, especially when it involves malfeasance by powerful corporations. Read how the unlikeliest of heroes emerges when a young, hotshot, Porsche-driving lawyer takes the case, initially with hopes of winning millions, and ends up nearly losing everything, including his sanity, as he is led to confront connected and powerful interests who will do anything to win. A Civil Action is considered by many to be the best book ever written on the legal system. ",Paperback,,0 pages,"

","El título de este conjunto de ensayos de Alberto Manguel deriva del célebre escrito de Erasmo. Para el filósofo de Rotterdam, la locura-""alegre extravío de la razón""-explica muchas de las actividades en las que incurren los seres humanos:ña guerra, el amor, la política, las artes.En todas épocas hubo locos, y la actual no es una excepción. Nuevo elogio a la locura concede un universo de personajes literarios e históricos, artistas y obras que abrevan en esa demencia sublime que, desde la antigüedad,desafía las reglas e instituciones. Allí conviven las profecías de los adivinos medievales con los mundos oníricos de Lewis Carrol; Pinocho como héroe rebelde y Roland Barthes con una erótica del texto; la genialidad salvaje de Antoni Gaudí y los paisajes desesperados de Vincent Van Gogh; la seductora atracción de lo oscuro en Robert Louis Stevenson y el culto a la diosa Razón de Sherlock Holmes.Con erudición y brillantez, el autor de una Historia de lectura propone un nuevo viaje por ese mundo de ensueño y realidades cambiantes que es la cultura, especie de sistema organizadores delirio. ""Tal vez el rasgo más distintivo del mundo humano sea la demencia"", afirma Manguel. Y agrega: ""Para un lector, ésa puede ser la razón esencial, tal vez la única, de la literatura; que la locura del mundo no nos conquiste por completo""",Paperback,,259 pages,"

","This book is a critical and carefully documented study of the influence of the teachings of economist Milton Friedman on the current administration. Claiming that Friedman's popular writings have exerted a powerful influence on the policies, ideology, and rhetoric of the Reagan administration, the author examines some 300 columns Friedman has written for Newsweek along with his best-selling books, Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose. While conceding that President Reagan has sometimes opposed Friedman's recommendations, the author argues that by examining which Reagan proposals deviated from Friedman's laissez-faire line we can gain insight into the Presidet's real objectives as distinguished from the goals contained in his free-market rhetoric.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Malladi's fourth novel transports readers on a cinematic journey through late-twentieth-century India as seen through the eyes of the inhabitants of Tella Meda, a religious community on the Bay of Bengal. Kokila comes to the ashram in 1961 as an 11-year-old orphan. She later renounces her arranged marriage to stay within Tella Meda's restrictive walls, a move she comes to regret. The ashram's guru attracts a cast of misfits from near and far--widows, abused wives and their neglected children, the daughter of a prostitute, a father guilty over his daughter's suicide--each illuminated by Malladi in her kaleidoscopic perusal of both the ills of India's caste system and the repercussions of rigid moral dicta. Running historical updates on India's wars, elections, and assassinations introduce each chapter. But the crux of the novel is how Malladi's female characters struggle with the stifling effects of caste and gradually respond to the movement for women's rights that surges as the century draws to a close.

","On the night of December 3, 1984, Anjali waits for her army officer husband to pick her up at the train station in Bhopal, India. In an instant, her world changes forever. Her anger at his being late turns to horror when a catastrophic gas leak poisons the city air. Anjali miraculously survives. Her marriage does not.A smart, successful schoolteacher, Anjali is now remarried to Sandeep, a loving and stable professor. Their lives would be nearly perfect, if not for their young son’s declining health. But when Anjali’s first husband suddenly reappears in her life, she is thrown back to the troubling days of their marriage with a force that impacts everyone around her.Her first husband’s return brings back all the uncertainty Anjali thought time and conviction had healed–about her decision to divorce, and about her place in a society that views her as scandalous for having walked away from her arranged marriage. As events unfold, feelings she had guarded like gold begin to leak away from her, spreading out into the world and challenging her once firm beliefs. Rich in insight into Indian culture and psychology, A Breath of Fresh Air resonates with meaning and the abiding power of love. In a landscape as intriguing as it is unfamiliar, Anjali’s struggles to reconcile the roles of wife and ex-wife, working woman and mother, illuminate both the fascinating duality of the modern Indian woman and the difficult choices all women must make.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

","From the acclaimed author of A Breath of Fresh Air, this beautiful novel takes us to modern India during the height of the summer’s mango season. Heat, passion, and controversy explode as a woman is forced to decide between romance and tradition.Every young Indian leaving the homeland for the United States is given the following orders by their parents: Don’t eat any cow (It’s still sacred!), don’t go out too much, save (and save, and save) your money, and most important, do not marry a foreigner. Priya Rao left India when she was twenty to study in the U.S., and she’s never been back. Now, seven years later, she’s out of excuses. She has to return and give her family the news: She’s engaged to Nick Collins, a kind, loving American man. It’s going to break their hearts.Returning to India is an overwhelming experience for Priya. When she was growing up, summer was all about mangoes—ripe, sweet mangoes, bursting with juices that dripped down your chin, hands, and neck. But after years away, she sweats as if she’s never been through an Indian summer before. Everything looks dirtier than she remembered. And things that used to seem natural (a buffalo strolling down a newly laid asphalt road, for example) now feel totally chaotic.But Priya’s relatives remain the same. Her mother and father insist that it’s time they arranged her marriage to a “nice Indian boy.” Her extended family talks of nothing but marriage—particularly the marriage of her uncle Anand, which still has them reeling. Not only did Anand marry a woman from another Indian state, but he also married for love. Happiness and love are not the point of her grandparents’ or her parents’ union. In her family’s rule book, duty is at the top of the list.Just as Priya begins to feel she can’t possibly tell her family that she’s engaged to an American, a secret is revealed that leaves her stunned and off-balance. Now she is forced to choose between the love of her family and Nick, the love of her life.As sharp and intoxicating as sugarcane juice bought fresh from a market cart, The Mango Season is a delightful trip into the heart and soul of both contemporary India and a woman on the edge of a profound life change.",Paperback,,229 pages,"

","Novelist and award-winning cookbook author Bharti Kirchner has written a sweeping family saga, a first class fiction about forbidden love and family honor.Set in the mountainous tea plantations of Darjeeling, India and in New York City, Darjeeling is the story of two sisters - Aloka and Sujata - long separated by their love for Pranab, an idealistic young revolutionary. Pranab loves Sujata, the awkward, prickly, younger sister but, out of obligation, marries Aloka, the gracious, beautiful, older sister. When all of their secrets are revealed, the three are forced to leave Darjeeling. Aloka and Pranab flee to New York City and Sujata to Canada. The story opens ten years later, when their Grandmother summons everyone home to the family tea plantation to celebrate her birthday. Despite the fact that Aloka is still very much in love with Pranab, they are in the process of getting a divorce. Sujata, who is still single, runs a successful business importing tea, a business that doesn't fill her broken heart. This trip forces the sisters to wrestle with their bitterness and anger and to try to heal old wounds. What complicates matters is that Pranab, too, is going to India and is intent on rekindling his relationship with Sujata now that his marriage is over.Although filled with the rich foods, smells, and social confines of another culture, Darjeeling is really about the universally human emotions of jealousy, rivalry, love, and honor. It is a complex novel about family, exile, sisterly relations, and how one incident can haunt us for the rest of our lives.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Born and raised in Chicago's Indian community, Sharmila Sen is a thirty-something artist, American in every respect but nonetheless longing for a deeper connection to her Indian heritage. Unlucky in love, Sharmila finally consents to follow the traditional path of arranged marriage and her mother soon finds Raj Khosla -- a handsome and successful New Delhi businessman -- for a perfect matrimonial match. Yet from the moment Sharmila arrives in India, events seem to conspire against her future happiness. Raj disappears for extended periods of time, leaving Sharmila to fend for herself in the uneasy and controlling presence of his mother. Most disconcerting of all is the mystery surrounding the ""accidental"" death of Raj's cherished first wife, whose memory is Sharmila's constant rival. Deliverance arrives in the unlikely person of Prem, the Khoslas' chauffeur, with whom Sharmila finds a daring relationship and a means to reexamine her life in a restrictive, exclusive culture that may or may not have a place for her. Filled with humor, romance, and suspense, Sharmila's Book tells the story of a contemporary woman who embraces the traditional life -- only to become liberated in the most unexpected ways.",Paperback,,400 pages,"

","The Best Little From-Scratch Bakery in Texas The pastry case in Rebecca Rather's bakery in Fredericksburg is packed with ultra-buttery scones, luscious cakes, cookies the size of saucers, brownies as big as bricks, and fruit pies that look as though they came straight out of Grandma's oven. Since the day Rebecca and her Rather Sweet Bakery and Café came to town, life in this Hill Country hamlet has been even sweeter and the townsfolk now know why she is the Pastry Queen. Everything she makes is a lot like her: down-home yet grand, and familiar yet one-of-a-kind.  A native Texan, Rather makes the most of her Lone Star state's varied traditions, whether looking to the kitchens of Texas's Mexican and German immigrants or to the cowboy culture of her own forebears. Best of all, her recipes aren't fussy—one of her best-selling cakes stirs together in a single saucepan. Add in a cupful of Texas attitude and her made-from-scratch-with-love philosophy, and you've got an irresistible taste of American baking.  What's best at Rather Sweet? Rebecca's customers all have their favorites (and she is happy to cater to their cravings), but here's just a taste of the perennial best sellers: •  Apple-Smoked Bacon and Cheddar Scones•  Texas Big Hairs Lemon-Lime Tarts (the only big hair Rebecca has ever had!)•  Fourth of July Fried Pies•  Peach Queen Cake with Dulce de Leche Frosting•  Turbo-Charged Brownies with Praline Topping•  All-Sold-Out Chicken Pot Pies•  Kolaches (pillowy yeasted buns with sweet or savory fillings)•  PB&J Cookies With over 125 surefire tested recipes and 100 photographs that richly capture small-town life in the Hill Country, The Pastry Queen offers a Texas-size serving of the royal splendor of Rebecca's baked goods—courtesy of the rather sweet gal behind the case.",Hardcover,,226 pages,"

","From October to December 1888, Paul Gauguin shared a home in Arles with Vincent van Gogh. This was, without doubt, the most celebrated cohabitation in art history: never, before or since have two such towering artistic talents been penned up in so small a space. They were the Odd Couple of art history. Predictably, the results were explosive. The dâenouement of their life together has entered into folklore. Two months after Gauguin arrived in Arles, Van Gogh suffered a psychological crisis. He spent most of the rest of his life in a mental institution. Gauguin fled from Arles, and they never saw each other again. But in the brief period during which they worked together a stream of masterpieces was created within the studio they shared. Here, for the first time, the full story of their life together is told.",Hardcover,,339 pages,"

","With 101 Life magazine covers to his credit, Philippe Halsman (1906-1979) was one of the leading portrait photographers of his time. In addition to his distinguished career in photojournalism, Halsman was one of the great pioneers of experimental photography, motivated by a profound desire to push this youngest of art forms toward new frontiers by using innovative and unorthodox photographic techniques. One of Halsman's favorite subjects was Salvador Dali, the glittering and controversial painter and theorist with whom the photographer shared a unique friendship and extraordinary professional collaboration that spanned over thirty years. Whenever Dali imagined a photograph so strange that its production seemed impossible, Halsman tried to find the solution, and invariably succeeded. As Halsman explains in his postface, Dali's Mustache is the fruit of this marriage of the minds. The jointly conceived and seemingly nonsensical questions and answers reveal the gleeful humor and assumed cynicism for which Dali is famous, while the marvelous and inspired images of Dali's mustache brilliantly display Halsman's consumate skill and extraordinary inventiveness as a photographer. This combination of wit, absurdity, and the off-handedly profound is irresistible and has contributed to the enduring fascination inspired by this unique photographic interview, which has become a cult classic and valuable collector's item since its original publication in 1954. The present volume faithfully reproduces the first edition and will introduce a new generation to the irreverent humor and imaginative genius of two great artists.",Hardcover,,128 pages,"

","When Jasmine is suddenly widowed at seventeen, she seems fated to a life of quiet isolation in the small Indian village where she was born. But the force of Jasmine's desires propels her explosively into a larger, more dangerous, and ultimately more life-giving world. In just a few years, Jasmine becomes Jane Ripplemeyer, happily pregnant by a middle-aged Iowa banker and the adoptive mother of a Vietnamese refugee. Jasmine's metamorphosis, with its shocking upheavals and its slow evolutionary steps, illuminates the making of an American mind; but even more powerfully, her story depicts the shifting contours of an America being transformed by her and others like her -- our new neighbors, friends, and lovers. In Jasmine, Bharati Mukherjee has created a heroine as exotic and unexpected as the many worlds in which she lives.

","National Book Critics Circle Award-winner Bharati Mukherjee has long been known not only for her elegant, evocative prose but also for her characters--influenced by ancient customs and traditions but also very much rooted in modern times. In The Tree Bride, the narrator, Tara Chatterjee (whom readers will remember from Desirable Daughters), picks up the story of an East Bengali ancestor. According to legend, at the age of five Tara Lata married a tree and eventually emerged as a nationalist freedom fighter. In piecing together her ancestor's transformation from a docile Bengali Brahmin girl-child into an impassioned organizer of resistance against the British Raj, the contemporary narrator discovers and lays claim to unacknowledged elements in her 'American' identity. Although the story of the Tree Bride is central, the drama surrounding the narrator, a divorced woman trying to get back with her husband, moves the novel back and forth through time and across continents.",Paperback,,302 pages,"

Now, at 23, she's decided that it's time to find out: time to track down her biological parents. She knows only the barest facts about them: her mother was a California flower child; her father, an 'Asian national' serving life in an Indian prison for murder. She knows that they were 'lousy people who'd considered me lousier still and who'd left me to be sniffed at by wild dogs, like a carcass in the mangy shade.' Her only inheritance from them is a literally haunting past ('white-hot sky and burnt-black leaves...star bursts of yearning'), but now she wants revenge too. 'When you inherit nothing, you are entitled to everything,' Debby says as she leaves home for San Francisco, where, if she can't find her mother, she suspects she can appropriate what she needs. Yet, once there, living the life of her newly named persona, Devi Dee (""Tenderloin prowler, all allure and strength and zero innocence'), she senses that she may have inherited more than she imagined: a legacy of shocking idea and impulse begins to reveal itself as Debby/Devi focuses her sights on the woman who may be her 'bio-mom,' or just a dangerously unprepared proxy.",Hardcover,,0 pages,"

","Jesus' death and resurrection are undeniably central to the Christian faith. But how, precisely, is their significance to be understood? Concerned to reinvigorate the church's teaching on the cross, the resurrection, and salvation - the atonement - Peter Schmiechen here invites readers to rediscover the wealth of the Christian tradition. In Saving Power he makes ample use of primary sources to unpack ten distinct theories of atonement, welcoming aspects of each rather than championing only one. Along the way, he demonstrates that while most Christians assume the basic theme of atonement to be sin and forgiveness, other powerful themes - liberation from oppressive powers, reconciliation in the face of division, and the hope of resurrection in the face of death, for instance - also deserve to be studied and preached. Affirming orthodox teaching while offering a positive take on marginal views, Saving Power is a crucial resource for anyone who seeks a fuller understanding of Christ's work.",Paperback,,371 pages,"

","National Bestseller In this, the first major single-volume biography of Andrew Jackson in decades, H.W. Brands reshapes our understanding of this fascinating man, and of the Age of Democracy that he ushered in.An orphan at a young age and without formal education or the family lineage of the Founding Fathers, Jackson showed that the Presidency was not the exclusive province of the wealthy and the well-born but could truly be held by a man of the people. On a majestic, sweeping scale Brands re-creates Jackson’s rise from his hardscrabble roots to his days as frontier lawyer, then on to his heroic victory in the Battle of New Orleans, and finally to the White House. Capturing Jackson’s outsized life and deep impact on American history, Brands also explores his controversial actions, from his unapologetic expansionism to the disgraceful Trail of Tears. This is a thrilling portrait, in full, of the president who defined American democracy.",Paperback,,656 pages,"

","Who is Matigari? Is he young or old? Dead or living... or even Jesus Christ? These are the questions asked by the people when a man who has survived a war for independence emerges from the mountains. Matigari is in search of his family, the rebuilding of his home and the start of a new and peaceful future. But his search becomes a quest for truth and justice as he finds the people still dispossessed and the land he loves ruled by corruption, fear, and misery. Rumor springs up that a man with superhuman powers has risen to renew the freedom struggle. The novel races towards its climax as Matigari realizes that words alone cannot defeat the enemy. He vows to use force of arms to achieve his true liberation. Lyrical and hilarious in turn, Matigari is a memorable satire on the betrayal of human ideals and on the bitter experience of post-independence African society.",Paperback,,,"

","Available for the first time, the full-length, unexpurgated version of the essay that incited one of the most passionate literary controversies ever in American letters . . .When the Atlantic Monthly first published an excerpted version of B.R. Myers' polemic—in which he attacked literary giants such as Don Delillo, Annie Proulx, and Cormac McCarthy, quoting their work extensively to accuse them of mindless pretension—it caused a world-wide sensation.""A welcome contrarian takes on the state of contemporary American literary prose,"" said a Wall Street Journal review. ""Useful mischief,"" said Jonathan Yardley in The Washington Post. ""Brilliantly written,"" declared The Times of London.But Myers' expanded version of the essay does more than just attack sanctified literary heavyweights.It also:* Examines the literary hierarchy that perpetuates the status quo by looking at the reviews that the novelists in question received. It also considers the literary award system. ""Rick Moody received an O. Henry Award in 1997,"" Myers observes, ""whereupon he was made an O. Henry juror himself. And so it goes.""* Showcases Myers' biting sense of wit, as in the new section, ""Ten Rules for 'Serious' Writers,"" and his discussion of the sex scenes in the bestselling books of David Guterson (""If Jackie Collins had written that,"" Myers says after one example, ""reviewers would have had a field day."")* Champions clear writing and storytelling in a wide range of writers, from ""pop"" novelists such as Stephen King to more ""serious"" literary heavyweights such as Somerset Maugham. Myers also considers the classics such as Balzac and Henry James, and recommends numerous other undeservedly obscure authors.* Includes an all-new section in which Myers not only considers the controversy that followed the Atlantic essay, but responds to several of his most prominent critics.Published on the one-year anniversary of original Atlantic Monthly essay, the new, expanded A READER'S MANIFESTO continues B.R. Myers' fight on behalf of the American reader, arguing against pretension in so-called ""literary"" fiction, naming names and brilliantly exposing the literary status quo.",Paperback,,149 pages,"

","Jane tells the spectral story of the life and death of Maggie Nelson’s aunt Jane, who was murdered in 1969 while a first-year law student at the University of Michigan. Though officially unsolved, Jane’s murder was apparently the third in a series of seven brutal rape-murders in the area. Nelson was born a few years after Jane’s death, and the narrative is suffused with the long shadow her murder cast over both the family and her psyche.Jane explores the nature of this haunting incident via a collage of poetry, prose, and documentary sources, including newspapers, related ""true crime"" books, and fragments from Jane’s own diaries written. Each piece in Jane has its own form that serves as an important fissure, disrupting the tabloid, ""page-turner"" quality of the story, and eventually returning the reader to deeper questions about girlhood, empathy, identification, and the essentially unknowable aspects of another’s life and death. Part elegy, part memoir, detective story, part meditation on violence, and part conversation between the living and the dead, Jane’s powerful and disturbing subject matter, combined with its innovations in genre, expands the notion of what poetry can do—what kind of stories it can tell, and how it can tell them.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Edward J. Martin and Rodolfo D. Torres offer a new and critical approach to the study of the welfare state in contemporary capitalist society. The authors not only demonstrate the analytical utility of classical Marxist theory, but also draw on wider critical 'postmodern' frameworks in the study of contemporary welfare capitalism. It is in this approach that they set out to argue that a critique of welfare policy within the context of capitalism is more timely and important than ever before. The authors go on to explore the demise of welfare policy in the United States using the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 as a point of departure. While liberal Keynesian theory argues that welfare policy can be managed through the state, Martin and Torres, argue that ultimately this relationship is problematic due to the limits imposed on it by the logic of capitalist social relations. The role of the state in capitalist society is evaluated along with other comparative welfare policy models. The book concludes with an analytic statement of alternative futures in the era of an empire of inequality. Savage State will be invaluable reading for students of sociology, politics, and social policy.",Paperback,,196 pages,"

","A fresh and perceptive new biography of Germany's greatest poet, whose life and times are a mirror for our own Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is often remembered only as a figure of literary genius, author of ""The Sorrows of Young Werther ""and ""Faust."" Yet Goethe was driven by much more than the desire for literary success: he wanted (much the same as us) to live life well. In ""Love, Life, Goethe,"" John Armstrong tells the dramatic life story of this great poet--a representative man akin to Wordsworth in England or Emerson in America. In so doing, he subtly and imaginatively explores the ways that we can learn from Goethe, whether in love, suffering, friendship, or family. At the center of the project is the human yearning for happiness: In an imperfect world, how can we live well with what we have, and accept what we haven't? From our lives at home, to our attitude toward money and the politicians we choose, Armstrong explores the main themes of our lives through the life of Goethe, and helps us learn how to live.",Hardcover,,482 pages,"

","There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN10 here.One of the towering figures of world literature, Goethe has never held quite as prominent a place in the English-speaking world as he deserves. This collection of his four major works, together with a selection of his finest letters and poems, shows that he is not only one of the very greatest European writers: he is also accessible, entertaining, and contemporary.The Sorrows of Young Werther is a story of self-destructive love that made its author a celebrity overnight at the age of twenty-five. Its exploration of the conflicts between ideas and feelings, between circumstance and desire, continues in his controversial novel probing the institution of marriage, Elective Affinities. The cosmic drama of Faust goes far beyond the realism of the novels in a poetic exploration of good and evil, while Italian Journey, written in the author’s old age, recalls his youth in Italy and the impact of Mediterranean culture on a young northerner.Translators include W.

","An overnight sensation upon its 1774 publication, The Sorrows of Young Werther became one of the first European best-sellers and secured its young author both fortune and fame. Loosely based on Goethe's personal experiences, the novel is written mostly in the form of letters in which Werther recounts his unrequited love for a married woman. Its Sturm und Drang style, portraying the rebellion of youthful genius against conventional standards, makes it a perennial favorite with readers of every era. Includes the original German with English translation on the facing pages.",Paperback,Dual-Language Book,240 pages,"

","The tradition of the German novel, before the emergence of its 'classic' writers in the first half of the twentieth century (Thomas Mann, Kafka, Hesse, Musil), does not have an assured place in the canon of European literature. Not that it has wanted for spirited advocates; but, despite all efforts, it has remained firmly on the periphery. The one signal exception is Goethe's novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers usually rendered as 'The Sorrows of Young Werther'. Werther was an extraordinary and immediate bestseller both in Germany and abroad.",Paperback,,132 pages,"

The moment Xandi wakes in Stefan’s muscular arms, feels the heat of his body pressing against hers, she feels no fear.

As their connection grows, and as Xandi gradually loses her sensual inhibitions, experiencing pleasures she never dreamed possible, she is drawn deeper into Stefan’s mysterious world, meeting the alluring beauty, Keisha, as well as the dominant and sometimes ruthlessly commanding Anton, who can have any man or woman he wants…in any way he wishes…",Paperback,,257 pages,"

","This 3rd edition of ""The African-American Odyssey"" includes not only a CD-ROM-bound into every book (which incorporates over 150 documents in African American history), but also has a broadened international perspective, expanded coverage of interaction among African Americans and other ethnic groups, and new material on African Americans in the western portion of the United States. Free access to Research Navigator is included. This allows readers to access this powerful research tool with one site. Written by leading scholars, ""The African-American Odyssey"" is a clear and comprehensive narrative of African-American history, from its African roots through the Civil War. Succeeding volumes carry on this theme through the modern era. This book places African-American history in the context and at the center of American History. Balancing accounts of the actions of African-American leaders with investigations of the lives of the ordinary men and women in black communities, exciting and readable coverage includes: African-American history from its African origins to the sixteenth century and the beginning of the forced migration of millions of Africans to the Americas. Succeeding chapters present the struggle of black people to maintain their humanity during the slave trade and as slaves in North America during the long colonial period. It continues through the Civil War and the beginning of Reconstruction. This is a compelling story of survival, struggle, and triumph over adversity. Readers will learn an appreciation of the central place of black people and black culture in this country, and a better understanding of both African-American and American history.",Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Mary Paik Lee, born Paik Kuang Sun in 1900, left her native country in 1905, traveling with her parents as a political refugee after Japan imposed control over Korea at the close of the Russo-Japanese War. Her father labored in the sugar plantations of Hawaii for a year and a half before taking his family to California, where Mrs. Lee has lived ever since. Though her father knew the comforts enjoyed by the educated traditional elite in Korea, after emigration he and his family shared the poverty stricken existence endured by thousands of Asian immigrants in early twentieth century America. Mrs. Lee's parents earned their living as farm laborers, tenant farmers, cooks, and janitors, and the family always took in laundry. Her father tried mercury mining until his health gave out. In their turn, Mrs. Lee and her husband farmed, sold produce, and managed apartment buildings.The author is engagingly outspoken and is extremely observant of her social and natural surroundings. Recounted incidents take on memorable life, as do the sharply etched settings of California's agricultural and mining country. She tells of singular hardship surmounted with resilience and characteristic grace. During much of her life Asian Americans were not treated as full human beings, yet she kept a powerful vision of what the United States could be.",Paperback,,264 pages,"

","Odysseys Home: Mapping African-Canadian Literature is a pioneering study of African-Canadian literary creativity, laying the groundwork for future scholarly work in the field. Based on extensive excavations of archives and texts, this challenging passage through twelve essays presents a history of the literature and examines its debt to, and synthesis with, oral cultures. George Elliott Clarke identifies African-Canadian literature's distinguishing characteristics, argues for its relevance to both African Diasporic Black and Canadian Studies, and critiques several of its key creators and texts.Scholarly and sophisticated, the survey cites and interprets the works of several major African-Canadian writers, including AndrE Alexis, Dionne Brand, Austin Clarke, Claire Harris, and M. Nourbese Philip. In so doing, Clarke demonstrates that African-Canadian writers and critics explore the tensions that exist between notions of universalism and black nationalism, liberalism and conservatism. These tensions are revealed in the literature in what Clarke argues to be - paradoxically - uniquely Canadian and proudly apart from a mainstream national identity.Clarke has unearthed vital but previously unconsidered authors, and charted the relationship between African-Canadian literature and that of Africa, African America, and the Caribbean. In addition to the essays, Clarke has assembled a seminal and expansive bibliography of texts - literature and criticism - from both English and French Canada. This important resource will inevitably challenge and change future academic consideration of African-Canadian literature and its place in the international literary map of the African Diaspora.",Paperback,,504 pages,"

Odysseus  survives storm and shipwreck, the cave of the Cyclops  and the isle of Circe, the lure of the Sirens' song  and a trip to the Underworld, only to find his  most difficult challenge at home, where treacherous  suitors seek to steal his kingdom and his loyal  wife, Penelope. Favorite of the gods, Odysseus  embodies the energy, intellect, and resourcefulness  that were of highest value to the ancients and that  remain ideals in out time.In this  new verse translation, Allen  Mandelbaum--celebrated poet and translator of Virgil's  Aeneid and Dante's Divine Comedy  --realizes the power and beauty of the original  Greek verse and demonstrates why the epic tale of  The Odyssey has captured the human  imagination for nearly three thousand  years.",Mass Market Paperback,Bantam Classic Reissue,542 pages,"

","This is the long-awaited work on Homer's Odyssey by one of our foremost teachers and scholars of the classicsJohn H. Finley, Jr. Already, generations of students at Harvard have benefited from his knowledge and understanding of Homer's words and world. Now his thoughts on the Odyssey are woven together in this remarkable volume.Finley begins by arguing the unity of design in the Odyssey, and shows the connection between the actions of three main characters: Telemachus' maturity brings Penelope to her long-delayed decision for remarriage, which, by producing the bow as marriage-test, gives the unknown Odysseus his means of success against the suitors. Finley also suggests that the poem is a kind of half-divine comedy. About an older man's glad return, it contrasts to the Iliad's story of young man's death far from home. It is a comedy to the Iliad's tragedy and, like Shakespeare's Tempest, it brings the absent king to knowledge which, though initially unwelcome, proves his and others' happiness.Throughout his book, Finley applies a lifetime's learning to a work that is universally recognized as one of the highest achievements of our civilization. At a time when Homer is in danger of being swallowed by specialists, it is important to recognize and uphold the poet's basic concern for life and myth and legend. Such sympathy combined with knowledge is Finley's fine achievement.",Hardcover,,244 pages,"

","By its evocation of a real or imaged heroic age, its contrasts of character and its variety of adventure, above all by its sheer narrative power, the Odyssey has won and preserved its place among the greatest tales in the world. It tells of Odysseus' adventurous wanderings as he returns from the long war at Troy to his home in the Greek island of Ithaca, where his wife Penelope and his son Telemachus have been waiting for him for twenty years. He meets a one-eyed giant, Polyphemus the Cyclops; he visits the underworld; he faces the terrible monsters Scylla and Charybdis; he extricates himself from the charms of Circe and Calypso. After these and numerous other legendary encounters he finally reaches home, where, disguised as a beggar, he begins to plan revenge on the suitors who have for years been besieging Penelope and feasting on his own meat and wine with insolent impunity.",Paperback,Revised Prose Translation ,370 pages,"

","Keats compared discovering Homer to ""finding a new planet."" What is it in Homer's great works-and especially the Odyssey-that so enthralled him? Why have readers before and since reacted the same way? By joining award-winning classics professor Elizabeth Vandiver for these lectures on the Odyssey, you can get answers to these and hundreds of other questions.At first glance, those first two questions indeed seem troubling.For the Odyssey tells of a long-dead epoch that seems utterly alien to us. Indeed, the Bronze Age Aegean was a distant memory even to the original audiences of these works.But age seems only to have burnished the luster of this epic.It may be precisely because of its very strangeness and distance that generation after generation of readers have come to love it so much.This strangeness and distance throw sharply into focus the timeless human issues that ride along on Odysseus's journey, voyaging to strange lands on the shores of wine-dark seas, dealing face-to-face with gods and monsters.A Single Riveting Question... and the Others It RaisesThe epic's exploration centers around a single question about the protagonist, and the two related questions it immediately suggests:Why does Odysseus long so powerfully to go home? What holds people together and keeps them going in extreme situationn such as war or shipwreck? Why do we love our own so strongly? It is this universal theme that seems of paramount importance. What does it mean to live?Professor Vandiver builds her analyses skillfully around meticulous, insightful examinations of the most important episodes in the Odyssey.She explains the cultural assumptions that lie behind Homer's lines, and you join her in weighing the basic critical and interpretive issues.Just as knowledge of the Trojan War legend is necessary for understanding the Iliad-available as a companion course-the Odyssey assumes that its audience knows how the war ended and what happened next.Learn the Story between the EpicsLecture 1. We begin with an overview of the traditional Trojan War story that took place after the Iliad. Next we examine the difference between kleos epic, with its primary focus on glory, and nostos epic, which focuses instead on homecoming. Lecture 2. This lecture defines and examines xenia, a concept that is of key importance for understanding the Odyssey and the characters of Telemachos and the suitors.Xenia is usually translated ""guest-host relationship."" It is a reciprocal relationship between two xenoi-a word which means guest, host, stranger, friend, and foreigner. It is not based on friendship, but rather on obligation.In addition to examining xenia, the lecture also highlights two other important narrative elements established in the Telemachy: the use of Agamemnon's story as a parallel for Odysseus's own Telemachos's need to assert his maturity. Lecture 3. In this lecture, we turn to Odysseus himself as a character in the Odyssey. The lecture concentrates on the aspects of Odysseus's character that are introduced in these two books: his desire to return home as a desire to reestablish his own identity his superb skills as a rhetorician, able to craft his speech to appeal to whomever he is addressing. Enter Odysseus... in His Own VoiceLecture 4. This lecture continues to follow Odysseus's interactions with the Phaiakians, and moves on into the beginnings of his own great narrative of his past adventures.The lecture addresses several key themes, including the continued importance of xenia as offered by the Phaiakians and how the conception of kleos in the Odyssey differs from that of the Iliad. Professor Vandiver also discusses how the appearance of the bard Demodokos in Book VIII may reflect the original three-day performance structure of the Odyssey. As the lecture concludes, we see how the encounter with the cyclops Polyphemos shows Odysseus at his most clever and quick-thinking but also causes all his subsequent troubles.Lecture 5. We continue following Odysseus's own narrative of the ""Great Wanderings""-Odysseus's narrative of his trip to Hades-including an examination of his encounter with Circe and the implications of the sexual double standard reflected in it and in the rest of the Odyssey. A Journey into HadesThe lecture looks at the first half of the pivotal episode in the Great Wanderings and ends with a discussion of the reasons for and effects of the abrupt break in the text, where the poem returns briefly to the third-person narrative.Lecture 6. This lecture continues to look at Odysseus's narrative of his journey to Hades. Professor Vandiver notes elements in the Hades narrative that seem particularly designed to enchant Odysseus's Phaiakian audience.She also considers the vexing question of Odysseus's own veracity before moving on to the final episode of the ""Great Wanderings""-the killing of Helios's cattle and the death of Odysseus's remaining companions. Lecture 7. This lecture moves to the second half of the Odyssey by discussing the change in pace and subject matter in the ""Ithakan""books.The lecture looks in detail at several important moments in the story: Odysseus's arrival on Ithakathe significance for xenia of the formulaic lines he speaks here for the third time his encounter with the disguised Athena their plan for his vengeance on the suitors. Lecture 8. The two books covered in this lecture, XVI and XVII, include Odysseus's reunion with his son Telemachos and his entry into his own palace disguised as a beggar.Follow Odysseus's Trials of SuppressionThroughout this section of the Odyssey the poet stresses Odysseus's emotional trials, for he must not: show joy at the sight of Telemachos display anger at the evil goatherd, Melanthios reveal sorrow at the death of his dog Argos.Each encounter reiterates Odysseus's supreme self-control and moves him closer to his utmost danger and most extreme trial.Lecture 9. This lecture looks in close detail at the two lengthy conversations between Odysseus-still disguised as a beggar-and Penelope in Book XIX, and the scene that separates those conversations, in which Eurykleia recognizes Odysseus.Lecture 10. This lecture, which covers Books XX through XXII, examines the ""contest of the bow,"" Odysseus's revelation of his identity to the loyal slaves Eumaios and Philoitios, and the slaughter of the suitors.Professor Vandiver continues her consideration of Penelope's knowledge and motives, as well as her focus on Homer's narrative strategies for increasing the sense of inevitability as the suitors' doom approaches.Lecture 11. This last lecture on the Odyssey itself discusses the final reunion of Odysseus and Penelope in Book XXIII and the resolution of several themes and issues in Book XXIV.Does Homer's Ending Work?The lecture concludes with an examination of the Odyssey's ending and a discussion of whether or not it is effective.Lecture 12. In this final lecture, Professor Vandiver turns to the question of whether the Trojan War has any historical basis.After looking at the history of this question, she recounts the story of Heinrich Schliemann's 19th-century excavations at Hisarlik and Mycenae and examines some of the issues still left unresolved by those excavations.",Paperback,,,"

","Franklin Roosevelt is the assistant secretary of defense. Thomas Dewey is running for president with a blunt-speaking Missourian named Harry Truman at his side. Britain holds onto its desperate alliance with the USA’s worst enemy, while a holocaust unfolds in Texas. In Harry Turtledove’s compelling, disturbing, and extraordinarily vivid reshaping of American history, a war of secession has triggered a generation of madness. The tipping point has come at last.The third war in sixty years, yet unnamed, is a grinding, horrifying series of hostilities and atrocities between two nations sharing a continent and both calling themselves America. At the dawn of 1944, the United States has beaten back a daredevil blitzkrieg from the Confederate States—and a terrible new genie is out of history’s bottle: a bomb that may destroy on a scale never imagined before. In Europe, the new weapon has shattered a stalemate between Germany, England, and Russia. When the trigger is pulled in America, nothing will be the same again.With visionary brilliance, Harry Turtledove brings to a climactic conclusion his monumental, acclaimed drama of a nation’s tragedy and the men and women who play their roles—with valor, fear, and folly—on history’s greatest stage.",Hardcover,,609 pages,"

In this stunning retelling of World War II, Harry Turtledove has created a blockbuster saga that is thrilling, troubling, and utterly compelling.
It is 1943, the third summer of the new war between the Confederate States of America and the United States, a war that will turn on the deeds of ordinary soldiers, extraordinary heroes, and a colorful cast of spies, politicians, rebels, and everyday citizens.The CSA president, Jake Featherstone, has greatly miscalculated the North’s resilience. In Ohio, where Confederate victory was once almost certain, Featherstone’s army is crumbling, and reinforcements of uninspired Mexican troops cannot stanch a Northern assault on the heartland.The tide of war is changing, and victory seems within the grasp of the USA. Still, new fighting flares from Denver to Los Angeles.Indeed, as the air, ground, and water burn with molten fury, new and demonic tools of killing are unleashed, and secret wars are unfolding. The U.S. government in Philadelphia has proof that the tyrannical Featherstone is murdering African Americans by the tens of thousands in a Texas gulag called Determination. And the leaders of both sides know full well that the world’s next great power will not be the one with the biggest army but the nation that wins the race against nature and science–and smashes open the power of the atom.In Settling Accounts, Harry Turtledove blends vivid fictional characters with a cast inspired by history, including the Socialist assistant secretary of war Franklin Delano Roosevelt and beleaguered Confederate military commander Nathan Bedford Forrest. In The Grapple, he takes his spellbinding vision to new heights as he captures the heart and soul of a generation born and raised amid unimaginable violence.",Hardcover,,616 pages,"

","Time travel doesn't work. You can't go backward or forward; you're stuck at ""now"". What you can do is travel sideways, to the same ""now"" in another timeline where history turned out differently.So far, only our home timeline has figured out how to do that. We use Crosstime Traffic to conduct discreet trading operations in less advanced timelines, selling goods just a little bit better than the locals can make. It's profitable, but families who work as Time Traders have to be careful to fit in, lest the locals become suspicious. Justin's family are Time Traders. The summer before he's due to start college, he goes with them to a different Virginia, in a timeline where the American states never became a single country, and American history has consisted of a series of small wars. Despite his unease, he accompanies Randolph Brooks, another Time Trader, on a visit to the tiny upland town of Elizabeth, Virginia. He'll only be away from his parents for a few days. Beckie Royer thanks her stars that she's from California, the most prosperous and advanced country in North America. But just now she's in Virginia with her grandmother, who wants to revisit the tiny mountain town where she grew up. The only interesting thing there is a boy named Justin--and he'll be gone soon. Then war between Virginia and Ohio breaks out anew. Ohio sets a tailored virus loose on Virginia. Virginia swiftly imposes a quarantine, trapping Becky and Justin and Randolph Brooks in Elizabeth. Even Crosstime Traffic can't help. All the three of them can do is watch as plague and violence take over the town. It's nothing new in history, not in this timeline or any other. It's part of the human condition. And just now, this part of the human condition sucks.",Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Count Hamnet Thyssen is a minor noble of the drowsy old Raumsdalian Empire. Its capital city, Nidaros, began as a mammoth hunters’ camp at the edge of the great Glacier. But that was centuries ago, and as everyone knows, it’s the nature of the great Glacier to withdraw a few feet every year. Now Nidaros is an old and many-spired city; and though they still feel the breath of the great Glacier in every winter’s winds, the ice cap itself has retreated beyond the horizon.Trasamund, a clan chief of the mammoth-herding Bizogots, the next tribe north, has come to town with strange news. A narrow gap has opened in what they’d always thought was an endless and impregnable wall of ice. The great Glacier does not go on forever—and on its other side are new lands, new animals, and possibly new people.Ancient legend says that on the other side is the Golden Shrine, put there by the gods to guard the people of their world. Now, perhaps, the road to the legendary Golden Shrine is open. Who could resist the urge to go see? Not Hamnet Thyssen or Trasamund. Not Ulric Skakki, Hamnet’s old comrade in arms: a good man to have at your side, although perhaps not at your back. And not, damnably, Eyvind Torfinn—a scholar, a very knowledgeable man but, alas, the husband of Hamnet’s former wife, Gudrid: a troublemaker if there ever was one. She’s decided to come along, too.For every one of them, the Glacier has always been the boundary of the world. Now they’ll be travelling beyond it into a world that’s bigger than anyone knew. Adventures will surely be had…",Hardcover,,332 pages,"

","Harry Turtledove’s acclaimed alternate history series began with a single question: What if the South had won the Civil War? Now, seventy years have passed since the first War Between the States. The North American continent is locked in a battle of politics, economies, and moralities. In a world that has already felt the soul-shattering blow of the Great War, North America is the powder keg that could ignite another global conflict—complete with a new generation of killing machines.“Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” In 1934, the chant echoes across the Confederate States of America, a country born of bloodshed and passion, stretching from Mexico to Virginia. But while people use the word to greet each other in the streets, the meaning of “Freedom” has become increasingly unclear.Jake Featherston, leader of the ruling Freedom Party, has won power—and is taking his country and the world to the edge of an abyss. Charismatic, shrewd, and addicted to conflict, Featherston is whipping the Confederate States into a frenzy of hatred. Blacks are being rounded up and sent to prison camps, and the persecution has just begun. Featherston has forced the United States to give up its toeholds in Florida and Kentucky, and as the North stumbles through a succession of leaders, from Socialist Hosea Blackford to Herbert Hoover and now Al Smith, Featherston is feeling his might. With the U.S.A. locked in a bitter, bloody occupation of Canada, facing an intractable rebellion in Utah, and fatigued from a war in the Pacific against Japan, Featherston may pursue one dangerous proposition above all: that he can defeat the U.S.A. in an all-out war.The Victorious Opposition is a drama of leaders and followers, spies and traitors, lovers and soldiers. From California to Canada, from combat on the high seas to the secret meetings where former slaves plot a desperate strategy for survival, Harry Turtledove has created a human portrait of a world in upheaval. The third book in his monumental American Empire series, The Victorious Opposition is a novel of ideas, action, and surprise—and an unforgettable re-imagining of history itself.",Paperback,,640 pages,"

","Harry Turtledove’s remarkable alternative history novels brilliantly remind us of how fragile the thread of time can be, and offer us a world of “what if.” Drawing on a magnificent cast of characters that includes soldiers, generals, lovers, spies, and demagogues, Turtledove returns to an epic tale that only he could tell–the story of a North American continent, separated into two bitterly opposed nations, that stands on the verge of exploding once again.In 1914 they called it The Great War, and few could imagine anything worse. For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the façade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. Featherston’s planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been. An enduring portrait of history, nations, and human nature in its many manifestations, Return Engagement is a monumental journey into the second half of the twentieth century.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,656 pages,"

","In this personal and moving book, William Gildea blends reminiscences of his boyhood in Baltimore with profiles of famous Colts players such as Johnny Unitas, Lenny Moore, Gino Marchetti, Raymond Berry, Art Donovan, Y. A. Tittle, and others. Recalling his relationship with his father and the love they shared for a team, Gildea evokes the spirit of 1950s America, when professional athletes were workaday neighbors and community was more than a political slogan. This is a story, too, about the geography of the heart: why something so simple as a team can arouse such emotional attachments, how a group of players with horseshoes on their helmets could have been part of the generational glue between parent and child. Written with feeling and insight, this is an affecting tribute to a team and a time etched in memory.",Paperback,,311 pages,"

","The Soviet Union won the Cold War. The Russians were a little smarter than they were in our own world, and the United States was a little dumber and a lot less resolute. Now, more than a century later, the world's gone Communist, and capitalism is a bad word. For Gianfranco and his friend Annarita, a couple of teenagers growing up in Milan, life in a heavily regimented, surveillance-rich command economy is just plain dreary. The eventual withering-away of the state doesn't look like it's going to happen anytime soon. Annarita's a hard-working student and a member of the Young Socialists' League. Gianfranco is a lot less motivated--but on the other hand, his father's a Party apparatchik. The biggest excitement in their lives is a wargame shop called The Gladiator, which runs tournaments, and stocks marvelous complex games you can't find anywhere else. Then, abruptly, the shop is shut down. Someone's figured out that The Gladiator's games are teaching counterrevolutionary capitalist principles. The Security Police are searching high and low for the shop's proprietors, who've not only vanished into thin air, but have left behind sets of fingerprints that aren't in the records of any government on earth. Only one staffer is left: Gianfranco and Annarita's friend Eduardo. He's on the run, and he comes to them in secret with an astonishing story: he's a time trader from our own timeline, accidentally left behind when the store was evacuated. The only way Eduardo can get home to his own timeline is if Gianfranco and Annarita can help him reach one of the other time trader sites in this world--and the Security Police will be on their tails all the way there.",Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","In 1942 Hitler led the world's most savage military machine. Stalin ruled Russia while America was just beginning to show its strength in World War II. Then, in Harry Turtledove's brilliantly imagined Worldwar saga, an alien assault changed everything. Nuclear destruction engulfed major cities, and the invaders claimed half the planet before an uneasy peace could be achieved.A spectacular tale of tyranny and freedom, destruction and hope, Colonization takes us into the tumultuous 1960s, as the reptilian Race ponders its uneasy future. But now a new, even deadlier war threatens. Though the clamoring tribes of Earth play dangerous games of diplomacy, the ultimate power broker will be the Race itself. For the colonists have one option no human can ignore. With a vast, ancient empire already in place, the Race has the power to annihilate every living being on planet Earth . . .",Paperback,,624 pages,"

","The year is 1915, and the world is convulsing. Though the Confederacy has defeated its northern enemy twice, this time the United States has allied with the Kaiser. In the South, the freed slaves, fueled by Marxist rhetoric and the bitterness of a racist nation, take up the weapons of the Red rebellion. Despite these advantages, the United States remains pinned between Canada and the Confederate States of America, so the bloody conflict continues and grows. Both presidents--Theodore Roosevelt of the Union and staunch Confederate Woodrow Wilson--are stubbornly determined to lead their nations to victory, at any cost. . .",Mass Market Paperback,,606 pages,"

","War seethed across the planet. Machines soared through the air, churned through the seas, crawled across the surface, pushing ever forward, carrying death. Earth was engaged in titanic struggle. Germany, Russia, France, China, Japan: the maps were changing day by day. The hostilities spread in ever-widening ripples of destruction: Britain, Italy, Africa...The fate of the world hung in the balance. Then the real enemy came. Out of the dark of night, out of the soft glow of dawn, out of the clear blue sky came an invasion force the likes of which Earth had never known - and worldwar was truly joined. The invaders were inhuman and they were unstoppable. Their technology was far beyond our reach, and their goal was simple. Fleetlord Atvar had arrived to claim Earth for the Empire. Never before had Earth's people been more divided. Never had the need for unity been greater. And grudgingly, inexpertly, humanity took up the challenge. In this epic novel of alternate history, Harry Turtledove takes us around the globe. We roll with German panzers; watch the coast of Britain with the RAF; and welcome alien-liberators to the Warsaw ghetto. In tiny planes we skim the vast Russian steppe, and we push the envelope of technology in secret labs at the University of Chicago. Turtledove's saga covers all the Earth, and beyond, as mankind - in all its folly and glory - faces the ultimate threat; and a turning point in history shows us a past that never was and a future that could yet come to be...",Paperback,,465 pages,"

","At the bloody height of World War II, the deadliest enemies in all of human history were forced to put aside their hatreds and unite against an even fiercer foe: a seemingly invincible power bent on world domination.With awesome technology, the aggressors swept across the planet, sowing destruction as Tokyo, Berlin, and Washington, D.C., were A-bombed into submission. Russia, Nazi Germany, Japan and the U.S. were not easily cowed, however. With cunning and incredible daring, they pressed every advantage against the invader's superior strength, and, led by Stalin, began to detonate their own atom bombs in retaliation.City after city explodes in radioactive firestorms, and fears grow as the worldwide resources disappear; will there be any world left for the invaders to conquer, or for the uneasy allies to defend?While Mao Tse-tung wages a desperate guerrilla war and Hitler drives his country toward self-destruction, United States forces frantically try to stop the enemy's push from coast to coast. Yet in this battle to stave off world domination, unless the once-great military powers take the risk of annihilating the human race, they'll risk losing the war.The fatal, final deadline arrives in Harry Turtledove's grand, smashing finale to the Worldwar series, as uneasy allies desperately seek a way out of a no-win, no-survival situation: a way to live free in a world that may soon be bombed into atomic oblivion.",Paperback,,547 pages,"

","Harry Turtledove’s remarkable alternative history novels brilliantly remind us of how fragile the thread of time can be, and offer us a world of “what if.” Drawing on a magnificent cast of characters that includes soldiers, generals, lovers, spies, and demagogues, Turtledove returns to an epic tale that only he could tell–the story of a North American continent, separated into two bitterly opposed nations, that stands on the verge of exploding once again.In 1914 they called it The Great War, and few could imagine anything worse. For nearly three decades a peace forged in blood and fatigue has held sway in North America. Now, Japan dominates the Pacific, the Russian Tsar rules Alaska, and England, under Winston Churchill, chafes for a return to its former glory. But behind the façade of world order, America is a bomb waiting to go off. Jake Featherston, the megalomaniacal leader of the Confederate States of America, is just the man to light the fuse. In the White House in Philadelphia, Socialist President Al Smith is a living symbol of hope for a nation that has been through the fires of war and the flood tides of depression. In the South, Featherston and his ruling Freedom Party have put down a Negro rebellion with a bloody fist and have interned them in concentration camps. Now they are determined to crush their Northern neighbor at any cost. Featherston’s planes attack Philadelphia without warning. The U.S.A. lashes back blindly at Charleston. And a terrible second coming is at hand. When the CSA blitzkrieg is launched, the U.S.A. is caught flat-footed. Before long, the gray Army reaches Lake Erie. But in its wake the war machine is spinning a vortex of destruction, betrayal, and fury that no one, not even Jake Featherston himself, can control. Now, President Smith faces a Herculean task, while an obscure assistant secretary of war named Roosevelt rises in his ranks. For the U.S.A., the darkest days still lay ahead. Across the globe, a new era of war has just begun. And in the hands of the incomparable Harry Turtledove, readers are treated to a masterful vision of what might have been. An enduring portrait of history, nations, and human nature in its many manifestations, Return Engagement is a monumental journey into the second half of the twentieth century.From the Hardcover edition.",Hardcover,,623 pages,"

","In the 21st-century Kingdom of Versailles, the roads are terrible and Paris is a dirty little town. Serfdom and slavery are both common, and no one thinks that's wrong. Why should they? Most people spend their lives doing backbreaking farm work anyway.But teenaged Khadija, daughter of a prosperous family of Moorish business travellers, is unfazed. That's because Khadija is really Annette Klein from 21st-century California, and her whole family are secret agents of Crosstime Traffic, trading for commodities to send back to our own timeline. Now it's time for Annette and her family to go home for the start of another school year, so they join a pack train bound for their home base in Marseilles, where the crosstime portal is hidden.Then bandits attack while they're crossing the Pyrenees. Annette/Khadija is separated from her parents and knocked out, and wakes up to find herself a captive in a caravan of slaves being taken to the markets in the south. She's in a tight spot.Then the really scary thing happens: her purchasers take her, along with other newly purchased slaves, to an unofficial crosstime portal…leaving open the question of whether Crosstime Traffic will ever be able to recover her!

Now he expands his magnificent epic into the volatile 1960s, when the space race is in its infancy and humanity must face its greatest challenge: alien colonization of planet Earth.Yet even in the shadow of this inexorable foe, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Nazi Germany are unable to relinquish their hostilities and unite against a massive new wave of extraterrestrials. For all the countries of the world, this is the greatest threat of all. This time, the terrible price of defeat will be the conquest of our world, and perhaps the extinction of the human race itself.",Paperback,,608 pages,"

","AMERICAN EMPIRE: BOOK ONETwice in the last century, brutal war erupted between the United States and the Confederacy. Then, after a generation of relative peace, The Great War exploded worldwide. As the conflict engulfed Europe, the C.S.A. backed the Allies, while the U.S. found its own ally in Imperial Germany. The Confederate States, France, and England all fell. Russia self-destructed, and the Japanese, seeing that the cause was lost, retired to fight another day.The Great War has ended, and an uneasy peace reigns around most of the world. But nowhere is the peace more fragile than on the continent of North America, where bitter enemies share a single landmass and two long, bloody borders.In the North, proud Canadian nationalists try to resist the colonial power of the United States. In the South, the once-mighty Confederate States have been pounded into poverty and merciless inflation. U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt refuses to return to pre-war borders. The scars of the past will not soon be healed. The time is right for madmen, demagogues, and terrorists.At this crucial moment in history, with Socialists rising to power in the U.S. under the leadership of presidential candidate Upton Sinclair, a dangerous fanatic is on the rise in the Confederacy, preaching a message of hate. And in Canada another man--a simple farmer--has a nefarious plan: to assassinate the greatest U.S. war hero, General George Armstrong Custer.With tension on the seas high, and an army of Marxist Negroes lurking in the swamplands of the Deep South, more than enough people are eager to return the world to war. Harry Turtledove sends his sprawling cast of men and women--wielding their own faiths, persuasions, and private demons--into the troubled times between the wars.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,656 pages,"

","The year is 1597. For nearly a decade, the island of Britain has been under the rule of King Philip in the name of Spain. The citizenry live under an enforced curfew—and in fear of the Inquisition’s agents, who put heretics to the torch in public displays. And with Queen Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower of London, the British have no symbol to unite them against the enemy who occupies their land.William Shakespeare has no interest in politics. His passion is writing for the theatre, where his words bring laughter and tears to a populace afraid to speak out against the tyranny of the Spanish crown. But now Shakespeare is given an opportunity to pen his greatest work—a drama that will incite the people of Britain to rise against their persecutors—and change the course of history.",Paperback,,464 pages,"

","A harrowing novel of the Civil War’s most controversial battle.In April 1864, the Union garrison at Fort Pillow was comprised of almost six hundred troops, about half of them black. The Confederacy, incensed by what it saw as a crime against nature, sent its fiercest cavalry commander, Nathan Bedford Forrest, to attack the fort with about 1,500 men. The Confederates overran the fort and drove the Federals into a deadly crossfire. Only sixty-two of the U.S. black troops survived the fight unwounded. Many accused the Confederates of massacring the black troops after the fort fell and fighting should have ceased. The Fort Pillow Massacre became a Union rallying cry and cemented resolve to see the war through to its conclusion.Harry Turtledove has written a dramatic recreation of an astounding battle, telling a bloody story of courage and hope, freedom and hatred. With brilliant characterization of all the main figures, this is a novel that reminds us that Fort Pillow was more than a battle—it was a clash of ideas between men fighting to define what being an American ought to mean.",Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","A new Conan adventure--from one of today's most popular writers of fantasy and SF!For decades, millions of readers have thrilled to the adventures of Conan, the barbarian adventurer invented by Robert E. Howard and further chronicled by other fantasy greats, including such notables as L. Sprague de Camp, Poul Anderson, and Robert Jordan.Now Harry Turtledove, one of today's most popular writers of fantasy and SF, contributes a novel to the Conan saga--a tale of Conan in his youth, in the year or so before he becomes the wandering adventurer we know from the tales of Howard and others.On the verge of adulthood, he lives in a Cimmerian hamlet, caring for his ailing mother, working in his father's smithy, and casting his eye on the weaver's daughter next door.Then war comes: an invasion by the Aquilonian Empire. Conan burns to join the fight, but he's deemed too young. Then, from the border country, comes an unbelievable report: The Aquilonians have smashed the Cimmerian defending forces, and can rule as they please. Soon their heavily garrisoned forts dot the countryside. Their settlers follow after, carving homesteads out of other men's land.Every Cimmerian longs to drive the intruders out with fire and sword, but they must stay their hands, for the Aquilonians have promised savage reprisals. Then, intolerably, the Aquilonian commander takes a wholly dishonorable interest in the weaver's daughter -- and he's not a man to wait, or even ask permission.It's not a recipe for a peaceable outcome.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

Set in the same universe as the Worldwar series, Colonization: Aftershocks brings us to Earth in the 1960s, where four superpowers rule: the United States, Russia, Nazi Germany, and the aliens of the Race.
The arrival of the aliens shot Earth technology forward at a dizzying rate—the world of 1960 includes routine space shuttle traffic, computers on every desk, and other high tech advancements. Aftershocks reveals that it was the United States that launched the nuclear offensive against the aliens, and when the aliens learn the truth, Indianapolis disappears in nuclear fire. In alien-held China, a full-fledged rebellion is launched, and in Poland, a nuclear bomb goes missing—held by Jewish forces who seek to use it against the Nazis.The nations of Earth begin to realize that their only hope in holding back the aliens will be to work together. Because separately, they may face extinction.About the Author: Harry Turtledove is a Hugo Award-winning and critically acclaimed writer of science fiction, fantasy, and alternate history.

","Turning the American Civil War literally upside-down, this winning fantasy brings to life a war to free the blond serfs of the North and raise them to equality beside their swarthy masters. Turtledove not only swaps South for North but replaces rifles with crossbows, horses with unicorns and railways with magic carpets. The book opens in the fourth year of the war, when it's clear that the gray-clad armies of King Avram of Detina have the advantage over the followers of the traitorous Grand Duke Geoffrey, who has proclaimed himself king of the seceded North. Many Northern infantrymen have been reduced to robbing Southern bodies for shoes and warm clothing; and while the North has the best wizards, the Southern engineers have invented a rapid-firing crossbow that gives their soldiers a tremendous advantage in battle. The course of this war closely parallels the real one, which makes for a somewhat predictable story but clears the way for a focus on the various entertaining and well-drawn characters, including numerous homages to-or parodies of-various historical figures. Charm and humor balance out the grimly realistic depictions of battlefields and occupied towns, flavor the beautifully subtle treatment of racism and help to mask the occasional lack of descriptive detail. While perhaps best suited to Civil War buffs, this tale proves quite enjoyable for the less tactically inclined, and it's a must-have for any fan of alternate histories.

","Videssos was not like Marcus Scarus' native Rome. But he found politics and intrigue the same--deadly! Book Three of The Videssos CycleSince the Roman legion had been mysteriously transported to this world of magic, tribune Marcus Scaurus had served the rulers of war-torn Videssos well. He had been largely responsible for ousting the Pretender and putting Thorish Gavras on the throne. That, of course, made him a hero.Rome or Videssos, however, Fortune was a fickle goddess.Now he and the legion were returning in triumph to Videssos the city after defeating a well-entrenched army of rebel mercenaries. But Marcus, betrayed by the one closest to him, was returning to be seized, dragged before the Emperor, and questioned under truth-drug like a traitor.Of the court, only Alypia Gavra stuck by him--but consorting with the Emperor's niece was dangerous. It could lead to exile--or death!Yet Alypia was attractive. And Marcus was lonely . . .",Paperback,,413 pages,"

","The twentieth century was awash in war. World powers were pouring men and machines onto the killing fields of Europe. Then, in one dramatic stroke, a divided planet was changed forever. An alien race attacked Earth, and for every nation, every human being, new battle lines were drawn.
HOMEWARD BOUND
With his epic novels of alternate history, Harry Turtledove shares a stunning vision of what might have been–and what might still be–if one moment in history were changed. In the WorldWar and Colonization series, an ancient, highly advanced alien species found itself locked in a bitter struggle with a distant, rebellious planet–Earth. For those defending the Earth, this all-out war for survival supercharged human technology, made friends of foes, and turned allies into bitter enemies.For the aliens known as the Race, the conflict has yielded dire consequences. Mankind has developed nuclear technology years ahead of schedule, forcing the invaders to accept an uneasy truce with nations that possess the technology to defend themselves. But it is the Americans, with their primitive inventiveness, who discover a way to launch themselves through distant space–and reach the Race’s home planet itself.Now–in the twenty-first century–a few daring men and women embark upon a journey no human has made before. Warriors, diplomats, traitors, and exiles–the humans who arrive in the place called Home find themselves genuine strangers on a strange world, and at the center of a flash point with terrifying potential. For their arrival on the alien home world may drive the enemy to make the ultimate decision–to annihilate an entire planet, rather than allow the human contagion to spread. It may be that nothing can deter them from this course.With its extraordinary cast of characters–human, nonhuman, and some in between–Homeward Bound is a fascinating contemplation of cultures, armies, and individuals in collision. From the novelist USA Today calls “the leading author of alternate history,” this is a novel of vision, adventure, and constant, astounding surprise.",Paperback,,656 pages,"

","In the 250 years between 250 and 500 C.E., Rome found itself transformed from a mighty global empire into a limited collection of Germanic kingdoms. The aspiration exhibited in these kingdoms (as well as in Constantinople and later in the person of Charlemagne) to recreate and reclaim the glory of the Roman Empire persists to this day, and an examination of this time is critical to anyone interested in politics or history. James Ermatinger's multifaceted account allows the reader a unique opportunity to view through various lenses the many and complex elements that contributed to the demise of this once-vast empire, investigating, among other things: the general religious and political issues of the age, the cultural and economic climate, the nature of the imperial household, and the role of the Germanic invaders. In so doing, he paints a vivid picture of a dying dream. This volume is ideal for use in the classroom, as well as for use in school and public libraries.Designed as an accessible introduction to this critical period, ""The Decline and Fall of Rome"" offers readers and researchers an appealing mix of descriptive chapters, biographical sketches, and annotated primary documents. An overview of the period is presented in the introduction, and is followed by chapters on late Roman culture, society, and economics in late antiquity; religious conflicts in Christian Rome; enemies of Rome; and why and when Rome fell. The narrative chapters conclude with a section placing Rome's fall in modern perspective. An annotated bibliography and index are included.",Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","AMERICAN EMPIRE: BOOK TWOIn this spectacular, thought-provoking epic of alternate history, Harry Turtledove has created an unparalleled vision of social upheaval, war, and cutthroat politics in a world very much like our own—but with dramatic differences.It is 1924—a time of rebuilding, from the slow reconstruction of Washington’s most honored monuments to the reclamation of devastated cities in Europe and Canada. In the United States, the Socialist Party, led by Hosea Blackford, battles Calvin Coolidge to hold on to the Powell House in Philadelphia. And it seems as if the Socialists can do no wrong, for the stock market soars and America enjoys prosperity unknown in a half century. But as old names like Custer and Roosevelt fade into history, a new generation faces new uncertainties.The Confederate States, victorious in the War of Secession and in the Second Mexican War but at last tasting defeat in the Great War, suffer poverty and natural calamity. The Freedom Party promises new strength and pride. But if its chief seizes the reins of power, he may prove a dangerous enemy for the hated U.S.A. Yet the United States take little note. Sharing world domination with Germany, they consider events in the Confederacy of little consequence.As the 1920s end, calamity casts a pall across the continent. With civil war raging in Mexico, terrorist uprisings threatening U.S. control in Canada, and an explosion of violence in Utah, the United States are rocked by uncertainty. In a world of occupiers and the occupied, of simmering hatreds, shattered lives, and pent-up violence, the center can no longer hold. And for a powerful nation, the ultimate shock will come when a fleet of foreign aircraft rain death and destruction upon one of the great cities of the United States. . . .From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,640 pages,"

","Harry Turtledove–the master of alternate history–has recast the tumultuous twentieth century and created an epic that is powerful, bold, and as convincing as it is provocative. In Drive to the East he continues his saga of warfare that has divided a nation and now threatens the entire world.In 1914, the First World War ignited a brutal conflict in North America, with the United States finally defeating the Confederate States. In 1917, The Great War ended and an era of simmering hatred began, fueled by the despotism of a few and the sacrifice of many. Now it’s 1942. The USA and CSA are locked in a tangle of jagged, blood-soaked battle lines, modern weaponry, desperate strategies, and the kind of violence that only the damned could conjure up–for their enemies and themselves.In Richmond, Confederate president and dictator Jake Featherston is shocked by what his own aircraft have done in Philadelphia–killing U.S. president Al Smith in a barrage of bombs. Featherston presses ahead with a secret plan carried out on the dusty plains of Texas, where a so-called detention camp hides a far more evil purpose. As the untested U.S. vice president takes over for Smith, the United States face a furious thrust by the Confederate army, pressing inexorably into Pennsylvania. But with the industrial heartland under siege, Canada in revolt, and U.S. naval ships fighting against the Japanese in the Sandwich Islands, the most dangerous place in the world may be overlooked.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,640 pages,"

","Otto of Schlepsig is risking his neck as an acrobat in a third-rate circus in the middle of nowhere when news arrives that the land of Shqiperi has invited Prince Halim Eddin to become its new king. Otto doesn’t know the prince from Adam, but he does happen to look just like him–a coincidence that inspires Otto with a mad plan to assume Halim’s identity and rule in his stead. True, Shqiperi is an uncivilized backwater, but even in uncivilized backwaters kings live better than acrobats. Plus, kingship in Shqiperi comes with a harem. Rank, as they say, has its privileges.With his friend Max, a sword-swallowing giant whose chronic cough makes every performance a potential tonsillectomy, Otto embarks on a rollicking journey filled with feats of derring-do, wondrous magic, and beautiful maidens–well, beautiful women. And that’s before he enters a royal world that is truly fantastical.",Paperback,,297 pages,"

","Easily the most celebrated historical work in English, Gibbon's account of the Roman empire was in its time a landmark in classical and historical scholarship and remains a remarkable fresh and powerful contribution to the interpretation of Roman history more than two hundred years after its first appearance. Its fame, however, rests more on the exceptional clarity, scope and force of its argument, and the brilliance of its style, which is still a delight to read. Furthermore, both argument and style embody the Enlightenment values of rationality, lucidity and order to which Gibbon so passionately subscribed and to which his HISTORY is such a magnificent monument.",Hardcover,,1952 pages,"

","Rhavas was a good, holy, and pious man-and the cousin of the Avtokrator. He would probably have become ecumenical patriarch of the Empire in the capital, Videssos the city . . . if his world had not suddenly and tragically fallen apart when the Empire of Videssos erupted into civil war and the Khamorth barbarians swarm over the borders. As the home he loved was brutally sacked, Rhavas had to flee for his life, then make his way through lands swarming with fierce nomads and with soldiers loyal both to his cousin and to the rebel. He may never see Videssos the city again, let alone preside in its High Temple. He has always followed Phos, the god of light and goodness, Videssos' god, and despised evil rival Skotos. Those who fall off the Bridge of the Separator during judgment in the afterlife tumble down to Skotes' ice forevermore. But when evil seems to have swallowed the whole world, what is a cleric who reverences logic as well as goodness supposed to believe? It's a harder question than Rhavas wishes it were . . . particularly when he discovers that his wishes-or curses-now can kill. Has evil Skotos chosen Rhavas as his agent? And can Rhavas resist the temptation to strike anyone down who gets in his way?",Paperback,,565 pages,"

","Communist China, Japan, Nazi Germany, the United States: they began World War II as mortal enemies. But suddenly their only hope for survival--never mind victory--was to unite to stop a mighty foe--one whose frightening technology appeared invincible. Far worse beings than the Nazis were loose. From Warsaw to Moscow to China's enemy-occupied Forbidden City, the nations of the world had been forced into an uneasy alliance since humanity began its struggle against overwhelming odds. In Britain and Germany, where the banshee wail of hostile jets screamed across the land, caches of once-forbidden weapons were unearthed, and unthinkable tactics were employed against the enemy. Brilliantly innovative military strategists confronted challenges unprecedented in the history of warfare. Even as lack of fuel forced people back to horse and carriage, physicists worked feverishly to create the first atomic bombs--with horrifying results. City after city joined the radioactive pyre as the planet erupted in fiery ruins. Yet the crisis continued--on land, sea, and in the air--as humanity writhed in global combat. The tactics of daredevil guerrillas everywhere became increasingly ingenious against a superior foe whose desperate retaliation would grow ever more fearsome. No one had ever put the United States, or the world, in such deadly danger. But if the carnage and annihilation ever stopped, would there be any pieces to pick up?",Paperback,,481 pages,"

","When the Duke of Bari suddenly dies, the neighboring nation of Algarve, long seething over its defeat a generation ago in the Six Years' War, sees its chance to bring Bari into the fold...an action which the other countries surrounding Algarve cannot, by treaty, tolerate. As nation after nation declares war, a chain of treaties are invoked, ultimately bringing almost all the Powers of Derlavai into a war of unprecedented destructiveness.For modern magic is deadlier than in ears past. Trained flocks of dragons rain explosive fire down on defenseless cities. Massed infantry race from place to place along a network of ley-lines. Rival powers harness sea leviathans to help sabotage one another's ships. The lights are going out all across Derlavai, and will not come back on in this lifetime.Against this tapestry Harry Turtledove tells the story of an enormous cast of characters: soldiers and generals, washerwomen and scholars, peasants and diplomats. For all the world, highborn and low, is being plunged by world war...into the darkness.",Mass Market Paperback,,684 pages,"

The Voice of the god Biton prophesies danger to the Northlands.Gerin has already beaten off invaders, both human and inhuman. But this time he faces an invasion by the Gradi, led by their cold, fierce gods. Gerin has to fight fire with fire by invoking all the supernatural help he can get from the capricious god Mavrix, the aloof but powerful Biton, and the more elemental gods of those who live beneath the ground.And just when things can't get worse -- they get worse. Gerin's neighbor, Aragis the Archer, has made one provocative move after another, and Gerin reluctantly decides that war is inevitable. But suddenly, the Elabonian Empire again turns its unwelcome attention to the Northlands, which it regards as a subject territory. Gerin and Aragis are now allies against a common enemy...and a very formidable one, with forces that outnumber both their armies put together!

Welcome to the world of the Derlavaian War, a world which is slowly but surely being conquered, mile by bloody mile, by the forces of the Algarvian empire...forces whose most terrible battle magics are powered by the slaughter of an innocent people. In this, the fourth volume of the series which began with Into the Darkness, the war for the continent of Derlavai builds toward its crescendo as the mages of Kuusamo, aided by their former rivals from Lagoas, work desperately to create a newer form of magic that will change the course of the war. But this is really a story of ordinary people--on all sides of the conflict--forced by fate to rise to their heroic limits...or sink to the level of their darker natures.",,,,,"['Fantasy', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'War', 'Science', 'Science', 'Fantasy', 'War']"

","For seven decades, L. Sprague de Camp was a giant in both science fiction and fantasy, renowned for his fast-moving action-adventure tales with a strong humorous element. Now, Hugo-winner and best-selling author Harry Turtledove has gathered together top writers in SF and fantasy to write stories in the same humorous adventure vein which de Camp practically invented. On board are Poul Anderson, Frederik Pohl, David Drake, Judith Tarr, Esther M. Friesner, S.M. Stirling, Michael F. Flynn, Turtledove himself and more, including a remembrance of de Camp by Robert Silverberg.",Mass Market Paperback,,400 pages,"

","This anthology brought together the most important historical, legal, mythological, liturgical, and secular texts of the ancient Near East, with the purpose of providing a rich contextual base for understanding the people, cultures, and literature of the Old Testament. A scholar of religious thought and biblical archaeology, James Pritchard recruited the foremost linguists, historians, and archaeologists to select and translate the texts. The goal, in his words, was ""a better understanding of the likenesses and differences which existed between Israel and the surrounding cultures."" Before the publication of these volumes, students of the Old Testament found themselves having to search out scattered books and journals in various languages. This anthology brought these invaluable documents together, in one place and in one language, thereby expanding the meaning and significance of the Bible for generations of students and readers. As one reviewer put it, ""This great volume is one of the most notable to have appeared in the field of Old Testament scholarship this century."" Princeton published a follow-up companion volume, The Ancient Near East in Pictures Relating to the Old Testament (1954), and later a one-volume abridgment of the two, The Ancient Near East: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures (1958). The continued popularity of this work in its various forms demonstrates that anthologies have a very important role to play in education--and in the mission of a university press.",Hardcover,,744 pages,"

","Independent scholar Phillips provides a new Hebrew-to-English translation of the Book of Exodus, showing differences in the Masoretic texts, the Samaritan Torah and the material found in the Dead Sea Scrolls through the device of paleo-Hebrew letters. This treatment seeks to solve some of the problems scholars have had in integrating the Samaritan Pentateuch into the whole fabric of the Book of Exodus, which was an issue because in some cases it appears the Samaritan version has claims to superiority in age and in being written in a script closer to that of the time of its first writing.

But there was no panic in the Legion, mysteriously displaced from Gaul and Rome into this strange world of magic.Wearily, Tribune Marcus Scaurus led his men through the chaos and enemy hordes in search of winter quarters, to regroup and seek to join up with Thorisin Gavras, now rightful ruler of Videssos.But in Videssos the city, capital of the beleaguered realm, Ortaias Sphrantzes, whose cowardice had caused their defeat, now sat upon the throne. There, behind great walls that had always made the city impregnable to storm or siege, he ruled with the support of evil sorcery. Overthrowing him seemed impossible.Grimly, Marcus Scaurus began the long march through hostile country toward that seemingly hopeless attempt.",Paperback,,322 pages,"

","WORLDWAR: BOOK 4At the bloody height of World War II, the deadliest enemies in all of human history were forced to put aside their hatreds and unite against an even fiercer foe: a seemingly invincible power bent on world domination. With awesome technology, the aggressors swept across the planet, sowing destruction as Tokyo, Berlin, and Washington, D.C., were A-bombed into submission. Russia, Nazi Germany, Japan and the U.S. were not easily cowed, however. With cunning and incredible daring, they pressed every advantage against the invader's superior strength, and, led by Stalin, began to detonate their own atom bombs in retaliation.City after city explodes in radioactive firestorms, and fears grow as the worldwide resources disappear; will there be any world left for the invaders to conquer, or for the uneasy allies to defend?While Mao Tse-tung wages a desperate guerrilla war and Hitler drives his country toward self-destruction, United States forces frantically try to stop the enemy's push from coast to coast. Yet in this battle to stave off world domination, unless the once-great military powers take the risk of annihilating the human race, they'll risk losing the war. The fatal, final deadline arrives in Harry Turtledove's grand, smashing finale to the Worldwar series, as uneasy allies desperately seek a way out of a no-win, no-survival situation: a way to live free in a world that may soon be bombed into atomic oblivion.",Paperback,,,"

","THE BORDER WARSAn uneasy peace had prevailed these last few years between the Empire of Videssos and rival Makuran. But now Makuran's King of Kings alerted his border holdings--even the small fortress where Abivard's father was lord--to prepare for barbarian raids. But Abivard himself received a warning of a different sort: an eerie prophecy of a field, a hill, and a shield shining across the sea.Before a season had turned, his father and his King lay dead upon the field of battle--the very place foreseen in the vision. Abivard hastened home to defend his family and his land. To his dismay, the most urgent danger came not from marauding tribes, or from Videssos, but from the capital. An obscure and greedy bureaucrat had captured the crown; the rightful heir had disappeared, and no mortal man would say where he might be found.Abivard's strange fate would lead him to his King, though, and on through peril to the very brink of greatness--and of doom!FIRST TIME IN PRINT",Mass Market Paperback,,356 pages,"

The German Reich has finally been subdued and the Race believe it only to be a matter of time before the rest of the planet follows suit. However, they underestimate humanity's desire for freedom and the lengths they will go to gain it. With America and Russia holding the alien invaders off in a technological standoff, the disorganised red armies of Mao Tse-tung's revolutionaries causing havoc and the ever-increasing dependence of the Race on the addictive substance ginger, the Empire realises that the colonisation of Earth may only be achieved through its total destruction.

When the barbarous Trokmoi killed his father and older brother, he became Baron of Fox Keep, warring against not only the Trokmoi and their fearsome evil wizard but also against the Empire of Elabon, which was happier collecting tribute than giving anything back for it -- such as soldiers or chariots. Then all four moons went full at once, and Gerin's life got really complicated. And after that, there were such small details as his son getting kidnapped, earthquakes, bad omens, a threatened war with his neighbors, and an even more threatening eruption of monsters from deep underground. Gerin kept trying to hang on to such civilization as was left in his own little corner of the world. Everything would have been a lot simpler if most of his neighbors -- and an irate god or two -- hadn't wanted to do him in.",Paperback,,608 pages,"

","In a parallel-world 21st-century San Francisco where the Kaiser's Germany won World War One and went on to dominate the world, Paul Gomes and his father Lawrence are secret agents for our timeline, posing as traders from a foreign land. They run a storefront shop called Curious Notions, selling what is in our world routine consumer technology-record players, radios, cassette decks--all of which is better than anything in this world, but only by a bit. Their real job is to obtain raw materials for our timeline. Just as importantly, they must guard the secret of Crosstime Traffic--for of the millions of parallel timelines, this is one of the few advanced enough to use that secret against us.Now, however, the German occupation police are harassing them. They want to know where they're getting their mysterious goods. Under pressure, Paul and Lawrence hint that their supplies comes from San Francisco's Chinese...setting in motion a chain of intrigues that will put the entire enterprise of Crosstime Traffic at deadly risk.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","At the bloody height of World War II, the deadliest enemies in all of human history were forced to put aside their hatreds and unite against an even fiercer foe: a seemingly invincible power bent on world domination.With awesome technology, the aggressors swept across the planet, sowing destruction as Tokyo, Berlin, and Washington, D.C., were A-bombed into submission. Russia, Nazi Germany, Japan and the U.S. were not easily cowed, however. With cunning and incredible daring, they pressed every advantage against the invader's superior strength, and, led by Stalin, began to detonate their own atom bombs in retaliation.City after city explodes in radioactive firestorms, and fears grow as the worldwide resources disappear; will there be any world left for the invaders to conquer, or for the uneasy allies to defend?While Mao Tse-tung wages a desperate guerrilla war and Hitler drives his country toward self-destruction, United States forces frantically try to stop the enemy's push from coast to coast. Yet in this battle to stave off world domination, unless the once-great military powers take the risk of annihilating the human race, they'll risk losing the war.The fatal, final deadline arrives in Harry Turtledove's grand, smashing finale to the Worldwar series, as uneasy allies desperately seek a way out of a no-win, no-survival situation: a way to live free in a world that may soon be bombed into atomic oblivion.",Hardcover,,,"

","The high school reunion occurs throughout the United States and cuts across differences in age, locality, and ethnicity. This popular event is commonly thought of as a light-hearted social occasion or an exercise in nostalgia that has little other significance in the lives of its participants. Drawing on candid personal narratives derived from reunions ranging from the fifth to the fiftieth, this pathbreaking study demonstrates, however, that for many Americans the high school reunion is a rich and often poignant experience.Of particular interest is the fact that this ethnographic study was conducted by a Japanese anthropologist trained in the United States, who offers a comparative perspective on high schools in the two countries. High schools serve very different social purposes in Japan and the United States, and the ways people in the two countries view their high school years differ accordingly.The author examines the American high school reunion as a dramatic scene in the construction of self and meaning in adulthood. During the high school reunion, Americans are thrown into a room full of mirrors in which they are confronted by different visions of themselves. There they see images of their high school selves filtered through the lights and shadows cast by classmates’ memories and projected against the backdrop created by the lives of those classmates in the present day. Through an analysis of the multiple reflections of self that emerge during reunions, the author shows how reunions afford people an occasion on which to reevaluate their own memories and arrive at a new understanding of self. The American high school reunion thus provides participants with a series of self-perceptions from which they can construct new narratives of their own lives.",Hardcover,,220 pages,"

","Harry Turtledove’s acclaimed alternate history series began with a single question: What if the South had won the Civil War? Now, seventy years have passed since the first War Between the States. The North American continent is locked in a battle of politics, economies, and moralities. In a world that has already felt the soul-shattering blow of the Great War, North America is the powder keg that could ignite another global conflict—complete with a new generation of killing machines.“Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” In 1934, the chant echoes across the Confederate States of America, a country born of bloodshed and passion, stretching from Mexico to Virginia. But while people use the word to greet each other in the streets, the meaning of “Freedom” has become increasingly unclear.Jake Featherston, leader of the ruling Freedom Party, has won power—and is taking his country and the world to the edge of an abyss. Charismatic, shrewd, and addicted to conflict, Featherston is whipping the Confederate States into a frenzy of hatred. Blacks are being rounded up and sent to prison camps, and the persecution has just begun. Featherston has forced the United States to give up its toeholds in Florida and Kentucky, and as the North stumbles through a succession of leaders, from Socialist Hosea Blackford to Herbert Hoover and now Al Smith, Featherston is feeling his might. With the U.S.A. locked in a bitter, bloody occupation of Canada, facing an intractable rebellion in Utah, and fatigued from a war in the Pacific against Japan, Featherston may pursue one dangerous proposition above all: that he can defeat the U.S.A. in an all-out war.The Victorious Opposition is a drama of leaders and followers, spies and traitors, lovers and soldiers. From California to Canada, from combat on the high seas to the secret meetings where former slaves plot a desperate strategy for survival, Harry Turtledove has created a human portrait of a world in upheaval. The third book in his monumental American Empire series, The Victorious Opposition is a novel of ideas, action, and surprise—and an unforgettable re-imagining of history itself.",,,672 pages,"

","Isolated in the remote Egyptian desert, at the base of Mount Sinai, sits the oldest continuously inhabited monastery in the Christian world. The Holy Monastery of Saint Catherine at Sinai holds the most important collection of Byzantine icons remaining today. This catalogue, published in conjuction with the exhibition Holy Image, Hallowed Ground: Icons from Sinai, on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum from November 14, 2006, to March 4, 2007, features forty-three of the monastery's extremely rare--and rarely exhibited--icons and six manuscripts still little-known to the world at large. The exhibition and catalogue bring to life the central role of the icon in Byzantine religious practices. Themes include the icon's status as holy object, the ways in which the icon sanctified the place of worship, and the monks' quest for the holy. The Greek Orthodox monastery at Mount Sinai not only functioned as a major pilgrimage site for centuries but was also a cultural crossroads at the center of the shifting sands of ecclesiastical and secular politics. The accompanying essays explore how the monastery's contact with the outside world, through pilgrimage, resulted in aesthetic exchanges between the monastery and Coptic, Crusader, and Islamic art; and between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic communities in Europe.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","On the morning of September 11th, a new kind of horror shook the world. Terrorists crashed two passenger airliners into the World Trade Center in the worst attack on U.S. soil in the nation's history. But at the same time a new generation of heroes rose up to fight it. This book chronicles not only the devastation of that day, but also the valor and heroism of those who saved thousands of lives.Not one of these photographs has been published before. On top of that, these images offer a vantage point no ordinary photographers could obtain: They were taken by members of the New York City Police Department, uniformed and civilian, who were on the scene moments after the first plane hit and who were behind the scenes during the entire rescue and recovery effort.Many officers took pictures during the course of their duties. Some were inside the lobbies of the World Trade Center before they collapsed. Some were in helicopters hovering near the burning towers. Some were trapped in the dust cloud after the buildings fell. They took pictures of the pandemonium around them, the fear, the effort, the exasperation. This collection portrays the courage of those who rushed into the danger so that others could escape it.One of the featured photographers, Detective Dave Fitzpatrick, was off duty when he heard a report of the attack over his radio. He immediately went to an NYPD airfield, joined a crew boarding a police helicopter, and flew to the World Trade Center. They arrived right after the second plane hit and were instructed to observe the scene and watch for any other incoming aircraft. Over the course of three flights that day, Fitzpatrick shot thousands of photographs that became the only aerial views of the devastation and early rescue efforts downtown. He also covered all Ground Zero operations for the next two months. His best photos, along with those of numerous other members of the NYPD, have been collected in this book. Together they make up the most in-depth visual document of the September 11th tragedy and its aftermath.",Hardcover,,192 pages,"

","If you search the scripture, you will find that there is a place where every man can meet his maker and that place is on Hallowed Ground. It was no accident that the believers written of in the Bible had a much closer relationship with God than many of us, if not all of us, do today. God's word repeatedly emphasizes that it was their obedience that was the key, for God will not allow the rebellious to remain in His presence. Isaiah 59: 1-2 Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. Since it would be impossible for anyone to live a life of continual obedience and true faith towards God without having experienced the new birth, this work was created to explain the highly misunderstood process of true conversion, the marks of the new birth, and the fundamentals of the Christian Faith.",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","This latest edition of our classic text draws on analysis of new material released from archives in Moscow, Beijing, Hanoi, and other capitals of communist-bloc nations--helping to develop a truly international history of the Cold War, a complex and dynamic conflict that lasted more than forty years and continues to shape the foreign policy of the United States and other nations. Another important recent trend considered is the intensive study of the role of ideology in influencing policy on both sides of the conflict. Dr. Levering holds that the liberal internationalism espoused by leading Democrats and Republicans during World War II, plus most Americans' profound dislike of communism and communists, contributed greatly to America's decision to oppose postwar Soviet foreign policy.Many recent studies of the Cold War emphasize the role of Marxist-Leninist ideology in postwar Soviet and Chinese foreign policy. Although these new directions in scholarship are important, the basic emphases of the original edition remains the same--U.S. actions and public opinion and relations between the two leading actors in the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union. Enhanced as well is coverage of the two large-scale but limited wars that grew out of the conflict, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and of the most dangerous confrontation of the nuclear age thus far, the Cuban missile crisis.",Paperback,,212 pages,"

","How has memory--collective and individual--influenced European politics in the aftermath of the Second World War and the Cold War? How has the past been used in domestic struggles for power, and how have 'historical lessons' been applied in foreign policy? This book is the first to examine the connection between memory and politics directly. The chapters combine theoretical innovation with historical, empirically-grounded case studies of major European countries. This ground-breaking book will be of interest to historians of contemporary Europe, political scientists and sociologists.",Paperback,,302 pages,"

","Charles Johnson Post (1873–1956) received not one but two handmade red flannel bellybands for protection against tropical fevers when he enlisted as a private in 1898 with the 71st New York Infantry. He was paid a monthly wage of $13.00, with an additional $1.30 combat pay per month. Setting off for what he later termed ""the little wars that are the mere trivia of history,"" he came back to write ""a mild chronicle of many little men who were painting on a big canvas, and of their little epic routines of life, with a common death at their elbow. It is only the little, but keen, tribulations that made the epic routine of an old-fashioned war.""",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Post-war Cinema and Modernity explores the relationship between film and modernity in the second half of the twentieth century. It begins with essays analyzing new post-war forms of film narrative and responses to the filmic innovations of the 1960s and the question of modernism. Pasolini's landmark polemic on the cinema of poetry is a vital springboard for the later critiques of time and the image, subjectivities and their narrative transformation, and the topical question of film and postmodernity. A discussion of changes in film technology and cinematic perception extend to the questions of film documentary. Finally, there is a focus on cinematographers and their filmic collaboration.The second section, International Cinema, places filmmaking and filmmakers in a social and a national context. It brings together landmark essays which contextualize feature films historically, yet also highlight their aesthetic power and their wider cultural importance. Filmmakers discussed include Ozu, Welles, Bresson, Hitchcock, Godard, Egoyan, Fassbinder and Zhang Yimou.Contributors include: Nestor Almendros, Jacques Aumont, Andre Bazin, Noel Burch, Scott Bukatman, Michael Chapman, Rey Chow, Terry Comito, Timothy Corrigan, Angela Della Vacche, Gilles Deleuze, Peter Harcourt, Frederic Jameson, Bruce Kawin, Krzystof Kieslowski, Vassiliki Kolocotroni, Teresa de Lauretis, Colin MacCabe, Christian Metz, Tania Modleski, Laura Mulvey, Bill Nicholls, John Orr, David Pascoe, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Duncan Petrie, Donald Richie, Larry Salvato, Dennis Schaefer, Paul Schrader, Susan Sontag, Andrei Tarkovsky, J.P.

","In 1950, Clive Staples Lewis published the first in a series of children's stories that became The Chronicles of Narnia. The now vastly popular Chronicles are a widely known testament to the religious and moral principles that Lewis embraced in his later life. What many readers and viewers do not know about the Chronicles is that a close reading of the seven-book series reveals the strikingly effective influences of literary sources as diverse as George MacDonald's fantastic fiction and the courtly love poetry of the High Middle Ages. Arguably the two most influential sources for the series are Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen and John Milton's Paradise Lost. Lewis was so personally intrigued by these two particular pieces of literature that he became renowned for his scholarly studies of both Milton and Spenser. This book examines the important ways in which Lewis so clearly echoes The Faerie Queen and Paradise Lost, and how the elements of each work together to convey similar meanings. Most specifically, the chapters focus on the telling interweavings that can be seen in the depiction of evil, female characters, fantastic and symbolic landscapes and settings, and the spiritual concepts so personally important to C.S. Lewis.",Paperback,,188 pages,"

Each of the seven books is a masterpiece, drawing the reader into a land where magic meets reality, and the result is a fictional world whose scope has fascinated generations.This edition presents all seven books—unabridged—in one impressive volume.

","British scholar and author Clive Staples Lewis (1898 - 1963) wrote more than 40 books, including science fiction, literary criticism, Christian apologetics, and poetry, but his most popular works remain the seven children's books that constitute ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", published between 1950 and 1956. Drawing on biblical symbols, Greek and Roman mythology, and English and Irish fairy tales, Lewis was able to create the enchanted setting of Narnia, a fictional world where magic meets reality. Today these novels continue to sustain an immense and wide readership, and have inspired an impressive body of literary criticism. The first published book in the series, ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"", is a perennial children's favorite. C.S. Lewis' ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" is an ideal resource for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of the epic topics and ethereal imagery presented in the works, and is a perfect guide for students composing compare-and-contrast essays on this enduring and endearing classic.",Hardcover,,236 pages,"

The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas—namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics.

It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future. (amazon.com)",unknown,,,"

","A new, definitive translation of Heidegger’s most important work.The publication of Martin Heidegger’s magnum opus, Being and Time, in 1927 signaled an intellectual event of the first order and had an impact in fields far beyond that of philosophy proper. Among the most complex and original analyses of the character of philosophic inquiry and the relation of the possibility of such inquiry to the human situation, Being and Time has long been recognized as a landmark work of the twentieth century. Still provocative and much disputed, Heidegger’s text has been taken as the inspiration for a variety of innovative movements in fields ranging from psychoanalysis, literary theory, existentialism, ethics, hermeneutics, and theology. A work that disturbs the traditions of philosophizing that it inherits, Being and Time raises questions about the end of philosophy and the possibilities for thinking liberated from the presumptions of metaphysics.This new translation by Joan Stambaugh takes account of English-language Heidegger research since the first translation of Being and Time in 1962. The Stambaugh translation captures the vital relation to language that animates Heidegger’s original text. Through this translation elements of Being and Time that were not so clearly evident hitherto should become more apparent to readers of the English text. The new translation of key notions here should serve as the standard for Heidegger studies to come.“Stambaugh’s new version has large virtues, and improves on the only alternative … [It] is best suited to beginning or general audiences … These will find its spare and unobtrusive apparatus, which lets the text stand out more simply on its own and not bristling with flagged complications, a decisive virtue … As a supplement or for comparison, or as a vehicle for reacquainting oneself with the work, it gives excellent service.” — TLS“This new translation … offers the text in a more precise and understandable English than earlier editions.” — Library Journal“Stambaugh’s greatest merit as a translator is her ability to render the most difficult of Heidegger’s prose … into an English that remains both elegant and as faithful as possible to the original … The bilingual glossary and index in the back are marvelously helpful … Any translation of Sein und Zeit cannot help being a welcome contribution, even a significant landmark, within the world of Heidegger scholarship.” — MLNJoan Stambaugh is Professor in the Department of Philosophy at Hunter College. She is the author of The Real is Not the Rational, The Finitude of Being, and The Other Nietzsche, all published by SUNY Press.Table of ContentsTranslator's PrefaceAuthor's Preface to the Seventh German Edition[Exergue]INTRODUCTIONThe Exposition of the Question of the Meaning of Being I.

","On Time and Being charts the so-called ""turn"" in Martin Heidegger's philosophy away from his earlier metaphysics in Being and Time to his later thoughts after ""the end of philosophy."" The title lecture, ""Time and Being,"" shows how Heidegger reconceived both ""Being"" and ""time,"" introducing the new concept of ""the event of Appropriation"" to help give his metaphysical ideas nonmetaphysical meanings. On Time and Being also contains a summary of six seminar sessions that Heidegger conducted on ""Time and Being,"" a lecture called ""The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking,"" and an autobiographical sketch of Heidegger's intellectual history in ""My Way of Phenomenology.""""This collection may well vie with Vom Wesen des Grundes and Identität and Differenz as definitive statements of Heidegger's ontology.""—Library Journal""The title of the English translation is that of the lead essay, the highly celebrated lecture which Heidegger gave in 1962 and which bears the same title as the never published 'third division' of the 'first half' of Being and Time. This lecture is perhaps the most significant document to be added to the Heideggerian corpus since the Letter of Humanism. . . . Stambaugh's translation is superb.""—Stanley O.

","Being-in-the-World is a guide to one of the most influential philosophical works of this century: Division I of Part One of Being and Time, where Martin Heidegger works out an original and powerful account of being-in-the-world which he then uses to ground a profound critique of traditional ontology and epistemology. Hubert Dreyfus's commentary opens the way for a new appreciation of this difficult philosopher, revealing a rigorous and illuminating vocabulary that is indispensable for talking about the phenomenon of world.The publication of Being and Time in 1927 turned the academic world on its head. Since then it has become a touchstone for philosophers as diverse as Marcuse, Sartre, Foucault, and Derrida who seek an alternative to the rationalist Cartesian tradition of western philosophy. But Heidegger's text is notoriously dense, and his language seems to consist of unnecessarily barbaric neologisms; to the neophyte and even to those schooled in Heidegger thought, the result is often incomprehensible.Dreyfus's approach to this daunting book is straightforward and pragmatic. He explains the text by frequent examples drawn from everyday life, and he skillfully relates Heidegger's ideas to the questions about being and mind that have preoccupied a generation of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind.",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Continuum's Reader's Guides are clear, concise and accessible introductions to classic works of philosophy. Each book explores the major themes, historical and philosophical context and key passages of a major philosophical text, guiding the reader toward a thorough understanding of often demanding material. Ideal for undergraduate students, the guides provide an essential resource for anyone who needs to get to grips with a philosophical text.  Heidegger's Being and Time is one of the most influential and controversial philosophical treatises of the 20th century. It had a profound impact on Sartre and Merleau-Ponty in their further development of phenomenology and existentialism, hugely influenced Gadamer's hermeneutics, and paved the way, partly directly and partly indirectly through Heidegger's later thought, for the emergence of deconstructionism. In addition to being a very important text, it is also a very difficult one. Heidegger presents a number of challenges to the the reader, asking them to abandon many assumptions fundamental to traditional philosophy, such as the mind/body distinction and the concept of substance. The text also introduces a whole host of new concepts and terms and as such is a hugely challenging, yet fascinating, piece of philosophical writing. In Heidegger's 'Being and Time': A Reader's Guide William Blattner explains the philosophical background against which the book was written and provides a clear and concise overview of the key themes and motifs. The book then examines this challenging text in details, guiding the reader to a clear understanding of Heidegger's work as a whole. Finally Blattner explores the reception and influence of the work and offers the student guidance on further reading. This is the ideal companion to study of this most influential and challenging of texts.",Paperback,,204 pages,"

Six more books followed, and together they became known as The Chronicles of Narnia.For the past fifty years, The Chronicles of Narnia have transcended the fantasy genre to become part of the canon of classic literature.

Now, in Enchantment, Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure.The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm.Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest — or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy's fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it.This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.",Audiobook,Abridged,0 pages,"

","Thousands of people live in the subway, railroad, and sewage tunnels that form the bowels of New York City. This book is about them, the so-called ""mole people"" living alone and in communities, in the frescoed waiting rooms of long-forgotten subway tunnels and in pick-axed compartments below busway platforms. It is about how and why people move underground, who they are, and what they have to say about their lives and the treacherous ""topside"" world they've left behind. There are even the voices of young children taken down to the tunnels by parents who are determined to keep their families together, although as one tunnel dweller explains, ""once you go down there, you can't be a child anymore."" Though they maintain an existence hidden from the world aboveground, tunnel dwellers form a large and growing sector of the homeless population. They are a diverse group, and they choose to live underground for many reasonssome rejecting society and its values, others reaffirming those values in what they view as purer terms, and still others seeking shelter from the harsh conditions on the streets. Their enemies include government agencies and homeless organizations as well as wandering crack addicts and marauding gangs. In communities underground, however, many homeless people find not only a place but also an identity. On these pages Jennifer Toth visits underground New York with various straight-talking guides, from outreach workers and transit police to vetern tunnel dwellers, graffiti artists, and even the ""mayor"" of a large, highly structured community several levels down. In addition to chilling and poignant firsthand accounts of tunnel life, she describes the fascinating and labryrinthine physical world beneath the city and discusses the literary allusions and historical points of view that prejudice our culture against those who ""go underground"". Toth has gained unprecedented access to a strange and frightening world, but The Mole People is not a daredevil jo",Paperback,,267 pages,"

","From Christian Science and the Jehovah's Witnesses to Soka Gakkai, Wicca, and Falun Gong, the last century and a half has seen an unprecedented growth of new religious movements, sects, and alternative spiritualities. New Religions offers an authoritative and lavishly illustrated guide to more than two hundred of these wildly varied groups and movements. The volume is organized according to an entirely new method of classification, which associates movements, sects, and spiritualities with the religious traditions from which they arose. Rastafarianism, for example, is shown to have its roots in Christianity, while Bahai is an offshoot of Islam. Included are both long-established groups like the Seventh-Day Adventists and the Hutterites and more recent movements like Santeria, the Unification Church, and ISKCON (the ""Hare Krishnas""). In addition to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Indian Religions, and the Religions of East Asia, sections are devoted to movements and groups inspired by Indigenous and Pagan Traditions, and by Western Esoteric and New Age Traditions. Particularly fascinating is the discussion of the religious offspring of Modern Western Culture, including Scientology, UFO-based groups (such as the Raelians), and even the worship of celebrities like Elvis and Princess Diana. Each entry clearly and concisely explains the history, beliefs and practices, and status in the world today of the movement or group in question. Special entries highlight broad topics such as New Religions in China as well as intriguing subjects such as Cargo Cults, Martial Arts, Astrology, and Feng Shui. Written by specialists, New Religions is a fascinating and colorful guide to the bewildering array of religious and spiritual options available to the modern seeker.",Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","In the 21st century, a vast and growing array of new religions and sects has emerged. Some are familiar traditions, moving further into prominence; others seem to have been made up almost overnight. The sheer number can be overwhelming and confusing. Many people know the names but have no idea what these sects and religions really believe. In this new reference, Nigel Scotland systematically examines fifty key groups in modern religion, including Mormonism, Kabbalism, Wicca, Scientology, and UFO religions. Each brief, but thorough chapter walks through the origins, core beliefs, recent developments, and present practices of the movement. Accessible and concise, this reader-friendly guide is a great reference for people who don't have time to study each in depth but want a quick overview in understanding.",Paperback,,255 pages,"

","A Guide to the World's Religions analyzes the twelve main faiths from the standpoint of their underlying concepts, philosophy, history, and current influence. The religions of the biblical lands, the religions of India, and the religions of East Asia are treated as groups. Since Dr. Bradley believes that the greatest understanding among men rests in the knowledge of their differences, he describes, in well-organized and enlightening summaries, not only the basic similarities but also the distinctive features of the religions.",Paperback,,182 pages,"

","An exploration into the vitality and richness of Japanese religious life! Distinguished scholar and teacher H. Byron Earhart provides a fresh, firsthand look at Japanese religious life, sensitively distilling its unique characteristics. Within the larger framework of the distinctive Japanese religious heritage, Earhart explains the major traditions; provides a historical-cultural context; examines objects of worship--kami (""gods""), Buddhas, ancestors, and holy persons; interprets Japanese concepts of worship reflected in views on society, space, time, and human life; and assesses the general world view created by the individual traditions taken as a whole. Religions of Japan is enriched by the author's fieldwork, which brings an immediacy to his description of a traditional rural community festival and the life story of a member of a new religion in a modern urban setting. The result is an insider's view of Japanese religious life today, showing its vitality and the richness and distinctiveness of its impressive heritage.",Paperback,,142 pages,"

","A captivating guide to Buddhism! Robert C. Lester provides an expert introduction to the diversified beliefs, traditions, and practices of Buddhism. Tracing Buddhism's historical development, Lester identifies its central concepts--the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, Nirvana, Karma--and describes the path to enlightenment through charity, moral discipline, and meditation. He examines Buddhism's enduring characteristics and its essential logic as a world view. Lester's rare approach explores the relationship between philosophical and practical Buddhism and, more importantly, the relationship between monastic and lay Buddhism. Moving from history to ideal to concrete practice, he vividly portrays the two major traditions of Buddhism--the Theravada as practiced in a Thai village and the Mahayana as experienced in a Japanesemonastery of the Zen sect. Lester draws upon the best scholarship, working the insights of historians, textual scholars, and anthropologists into a highly readable and captivating guide.",Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Can we address the issue of nationalism without polemics and restore it to the domain of social science? Claudio Lomnitz-Adler takes a major step in that direction by applying anthropological tools to the study of national culture. His sweeping and innovative interpretation of Mexican national ideology constructs an entirely new theoretical framework for the study of national and regional cultures everywhere. With an analysis of culture and ideology in internally differentiated regional spaces—in this case Morelos and the Huasteca in Mexico—Exits from the Labyrinth links rich ethnographic and historical research to two specific aspects of Mexican national ideology and culture: the history of legitimacy and charisma in Mexican politics, and the relationship between the national community and racial ideology.",Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","In Mexico, as elsewhere, the national space, that network of places where the people interact with state institutions, is constantly changing. How it does so, how it develops, is a historical process-a process that Claudio Lomnitz exposes and investigates in this book, which develops a distinct view of the cultural politics of nation building in Mexico. Lomnitz highlights the varied, evolving, and often conflicting efforts that have been made by Mexicans over the past two centuries to imagine, organize, represent, and know their country, its relations with the wider world, and its internal differences and inequalities. Firmly based on particulars and committed to the specificity of such thinking, this book also has broad implications for how a theoretically informed history can and should be done.An exploration of Mexican national space by way of an analysis of nationalism, the public sphere, and knowledge production, Deep Mexico, Silent Mexico brings an original perspective to the dynamics of national cultural production on the periphery. Its blending of theoretical innovation, historical inquiry, and critical engagement provides a new model for the writing of history and anthropology in contemporary Mexico and beyond.Public Worlds Series, volume 9",Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","Over twenty-five years and through five editions, Walter I. Trattner's From Poor Law to Welfare State has served as the standard text on the history of welfare policy in the United States. The only comprehensive account of American social welfare history from the colonial era to the present, the new sixth edition has been updated to include the latest developments in our society as well as trends in social welfare.Trattner provides in-depth examination of developments in child welfare, public health, and the evolution of social work as a profession, showing how all these changes affected the treatment of the poor and needy in America.

Through an examination of the history of the symbolism of death, this innovative study is a landmark in the comprehension of the unique, rich usage which Mexico has made of the image of death. Unlike contemporary Europeans and North Americans, whose denial of death is deeply imbedded in their cultures, Mexico cultivates a good-humored familiarity with death that has made death a cornerstone of the country's national identity.",Paperback,,525 pages,"

","Rebecca Nachman is a Rabbi without a synagogue. Having resigned from her dwindling congregation, she now works as a college counselor at a small Vermont college advising students about private matters and offering the ""Jewish perspective"" on issues raised at faculty dinner parties.Deeply lonely and on the edge of losing her faith, she comes into possession of a Torah, the last relic of Czechowa, a village of Polish Jews who were exterminated by the Nazis. With the Torah, the unquiet spirits of the village dead begin to visit Rebecca. On one visit they leave a manuscript written in Hebrew and titled My Life, an autobiography by God who, like any eager author, is seeking a sympathetic reader. No one has ever finished reading the manuscript, including Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, Maimonides, and Augustine. God thinks Rebecca will.Rebecca's life is further complicated when one of her advisees-a troubled young woman who seemed on the verge of confessing something-is found murdered. As the college struggles to comprehend the tragedy and a police investigation is launched, Rebecca begins reading, and so comes to confront the central challenge to her faith in His most troubling and unlikely incarnation.Julius Lester's first adult novel in more than a decade, The Autobiography of God marks the return of an utterly original and provocative voice in American letters, addressing religion with wicked humor and profound reverence.",Paperback,,247 pages,"

She travelled to the most holy sites of the medieval world, including Rome and Jerusalem.In her life and her boisterous devotion, Kempe antagonized many of those around her; yet she also garnered friends and supporters who helped to record her experiences.

","This is the story of one man's faith, told with unrivaled reflection and candor. William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction.In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. ""Nearer, My God"" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues.

","Said God to Moses, ""I am who I am.""  Ever since, questions about God abound. Who, what, where, when, why? Even, how many? In the Christian faith tradition, what about all that ""trinitarian"" stuff - the Father, the Son, the Holy Sprit? Is it one God? Three Gods? What's up?  I AM WHO I AM is God's answer to all these questions and more. For the first time ever, God speaks out. The God of the Holy Spirit, the immanent God inside, speaks out And all is good.  I AM WHO I AM is God's answer to all these questions and more. For the first time ever, God speaks out. By overthrowing the hierarchical Trinity (with the Father enjoying a view from the top and the Holy Spirit bringing up the rear) and by replacing it with a circular Trinity having no beginning and no end, for the first time ever, God is free to speak God's mind. The God of the Holy Spirit, the immanent God inside, speaks out And all is good.  The book is divided into six Parts (as we all know, on the seventh, God rests). After a general introduction in Part I, Parts II - IV are devoted to each persona of the Trinity offering thoughts on anything and everything: on Creation and the Creative Process; on the ""mind of God; "" on the need for an ""extreme make-over"" when it comes to God and the Holy Trinity in contemporary society; on the universality of the story of Jesus; and so much more. Speaking to the reader in no-nonsense, user-friendly terms, Part V addresses such theological topics as ""The Prayer of the Preyer,"" ""S.I.N.,"" Satan, Heaven, Hell, and everything in between. The final part, the Epilogue, is a return of that talking donkey out of the Book of Number's, Balaam's Donkey, reporting from the parade route ofJesus into Jerusalem. It is something that no one should miss.  Finally, an autobiography of God as seen through the lens of God  Finally, the God of the Holy Spirit gets his/her say  And all is good.  (I AM WHO I AM is the first of three autobiographies featuring God, Satan, and Jesus, respectively. Stay tuned for Satan's personal story in E-MAILS FROM THE UNDERWORLD and for I AM THE WORD: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JESUS.)",Paperback,,212 pages,"

","As the lines between advertising, news, and entertainment blur, the ideal of an informed citizenry becomes harder and harder to achieve. We, the American public, aren't sure anymore what to believe, or where to put our money and trust. We know we're being manipulated, misled, and outright lied to by those who seek our support. Whether it comes from advertisers, activists, or the government, the manipulation is constant and pervasive.Those who are supposed to help us understand the world and the problems we face frequently fail us. Journalists and the news media offer entertainment and sensationalism instead of significant information. Politicians and lawmakers who guide our country are little better; instead of real solutions, we are offered merely illusions of change.This hard-hitting critique of our media culture examines not only the ways in which we are deceived, but the media's role in propagating those deceptions. But Media Mythmakers goes beyond criticism to give concrete examples of the damage that manipulation of the news causes. From missing children to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, from the efforts to end slavery to AIDS education, myths and deception in the media threaten us all. While the public is being misled, real problems go unaddressed and resources are wasted on misguided ideas.In an increasingly complex world, where accurate and unbiased information is more important than ever, this book provides a timely and much-needed analysis.",Hardcover,,230 pages,"

","Maccoby, a Talmudic scholar from London's Leo Baeck College, will inflame many with his contention that Paul, not Jesus, was the true founder of Xianity. Despite impressive research, the author's needlessly pugilistic stance--he comes off as one defending the honor of Judaism against pagan insurgents--bleeds his argument of real force. In sum, these are his beliefs: Paul, who claimed to be a Pharisee rabbi, was in fact ""an adventurer of undistinguished background""; Jesus, portrayed by Gospel writers as opposing the Pharisees, was in fact one himself, a devout Jew who believed he'd been chosen by God to overthrow Roman rule & reign as King of Israel; the earliest Xians didn't preach the divinity of Christ until Paul rejected the Torah & replaced it with a pagan myth of a dying & resurrected god. When it comes to asserting the Jewishness of Jesus, he stands on firm ground alongside most contemporary scholars. His work will probably strengthen the belief that Jesus was to some extent an anti-Roman political revolutionary, Paul a Hellenistic interloper. However, it's difficult to take seriously the charge that Paul ""sought fame by founding a new religion"" because he ""was disappointed in his hopes of advancement."" By making Paul out as a sort of carnival huckster, he ignores the apostle's religious profundity; by making of Paul a spiritual Svengali who misled many of Jesus' closest followers, he'll seem to some to be promulgating his own religious myth. His arguments simply confirm the observation that when it comes to the early years of Xianity, documentary material is so scarce & fragmentary that the few available texts can, & have, been used to bolster every conceivable viewpoint. Like other debunkers, he sometimes lets polemic get in the way of prudence; many of his assertions stand unsubstantiated by quote or other reference. A historical brief of questionable reliability--but undeniably fascinating. Elegantly argued, this should ruffle feathers for years to come.--Kirkus (edited)",Paperback,,249 pages,"

","This study is the first to consider the whole body of Leonardo's works with an eye to a comprehensive interpretation that combines both cultural history and the history of ideas. According to Maiorino, Leonardo's was a mythmaking mode of activity that had a Daedalian range and affected art and technology alike. As both artist and inventor, Leonardo did not separate reason from experience, empiricism from abstraction, an attitude Maiorino characterizes as ""Anti-Humanism."" Rather than accepting the earlier view that the culture of the Renaissance was divided against itself or that it came to be divided, he argues that anti-Humanism was present from the start in such founders as Petrarch and Alberti and continued to be a current in later authors and artists; hence the significance of Leonardo to Humanism and to Baroque and Renaissance culture at large.",Hardcover,,320 pages,"

The participants exchanged views on the significance of Abraham and the founding figures of each faith (Moses, Jesus and Muhammad); examined how the three religions are connected; compared ideas on the nature of revelation, scripture, law and grace; explored the meaning of peoplehood in each community and - in the final section - reflected on how they had been affected by the dialogues.",Paperback,,280 pages,"

","After many years of daily UNIX and Internet activity, we came to be enthusiasts of the World-Wide Web while trying to choose an authoring system for a CD-ROM project. We decided to use Web software for the CD-ROM, thus seamlessly integrating the two dis- joint worlds of CD-ROM publishing and the Internet. We are grate- ful to our publisher, Allan M. Wylde, for the initiative leading to that idea and then to this book. As we enter the third millennium and complete the computer revo- lution, our future will depend on our creative actions taken today. The politics of cyberspace, our future world, are being determined now by those who are already empowered with full cyberfunction- ality on the Internet - which today means the multimedia browsing capabilities of the WWW.theWorld-WideWeb.Itis urgent that concerned people extend themselves as soon as possible into this new world, to participate in the creation of the future. Our purpose in presenting this introduction and empowerment package is to enable as many people as possible to attain this level of citizenship in the future. Turn on, boot up, and jack in!

","Not since the early nineteenth century, when California was still part of Mexico, have there been such close ties between Mexico and its former northern territory. Today, one Californian in five is of Mexican heritage, compared with fewer than one in ten in 1970. California is Mexico's second-largest trading partner (after Texas) and Mexico is California's second-largest trading partner (after Japan). This book is the first in any language to explore the nature, scope, and effects of the California-Mexico connection. It analyses the movements of people, goods, money, politics, and culture across the California-Mexico border, and explores its implications for both parties.",Paperback,,388 pages,"

","The author of The Other Boleyn Girl (2002) returns to the executed queen's doomed family in a historical novel that maps the sad demise of Henry VIII in a series of intimate personal testimonies.Gregory's tale of greed and revenge takes place against the short, unhappy tenures of Henry's fourth and fifth wives. Jockeying for position close to the throne, three powerful, ambitious women collide. The author skillfully allows each character to tell her side of the story in her own words. The first voice we hear belongs to 30-year-old Jane Boleyn, widowed sister-in-law to Anne. Jane's husband George was implicated in his sister's alleged infidelities and went with her to the scaffold in 1533; his calculating wife moved to save her inheritance rather than her husband and six years later is still scheming. Next up is Anne of Cleves, soon to be Queen Number Four, a provincial, German-speaking Protestant princess chosen by Henry's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, as a politically suitable alliance to keep Spain and France at bay. Badgered and bullied all her life by her brother and mother, 24-year-old Anne wants nothing more than to escape Cleves and have a meaningful life. The third voice belongs to Katherine Howard, a pretty, 15-year-old cousin of the dead Anne Boleyn and an incorrigible flirt who is brought to court as a lady-in-waiting by her conniving, powerful uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Also summoned to court to attend the new queen, Jane begins plotting behind the scenes with Norfolk to assure Anne of Cleve's hasty fall and Katherine's quick ascent in Henry's favor. Gregory's knowledge of the period, combined with her novelistic skill, allows her to view this grim tale through the eyes of the three women: wily, experienced Jane; na™ve, sensible Anne; and vain, greedy young Kitty. Their first-person accounts are convincing and shockingly self-serving.",Audio CD,Unabridged,15 pages,"

He examines the new federal law requiring prospective fathers to free themselves from their self-made macho prisons--to laugh, cry, love and just generally behave like certified wimps.Dave also reveals, for the first time in print, the secret chant for painless childbirth.Then learn why no secret chant could possibly take a woman's mind off the fact that she is in such pain that she wants a gigantic comet to crash into the earth and kill her and her husband and the dotor and the nurses and everyone else in the world.",Paperback,,96 pages,"

Throughout her life, which spanned the Nazi era, the war, and the postwar consumer economy, she struggled to maintain appearances, only to arrive at a terrible recognition: ""I'm not human any more."" Not long after, she killed herself with an overdose of sleeping pills.In A Sorrow Beyond Dreams her son sits down to record what he knows, or thinks he knows, about his mother's life and death before, in his words, ""the dull speechlessness—the extreme speechlessness"" of grief takes hold forever. And yet the experience of speechlessness, as it marks both suffering and love, lies at the heart of Handke's brief but unforgettable elegy.

","This translation captures the terse and enigmatic beauty of the ancient original and resists the tendency toward interpretive paraphrase found in many other editions. Along with the complete translation, Lombardo and Addiss provide one or more key lines from the original Chinese for each of the eighty-one sections, together with a transliteration of the Chinese characters and a glossary commenting on the pronunciation and meaning of each Chinese character displayed. This greatly enhances the reader's appreciation of how the Chinese text works and feels and the different ways it can be translated into English.",Paperback,,106 pages,"

","Following the successful debut of the Parent's Tao Te Ching---William Martin now reinterprets the Tao for couples.With The Parent's Tao Te Ching, William Martin beautifully re-interpreted Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching--one of the world's oldest and most widely read books of wisdom--expressly for parents. Now, he distills and freshly re-interprets the essence of each of the Tao's 81 chapters to speak directly and clearly to couples.William Martin's indelible, spirited, and sage advice, rendered in free verse, captures the ancient spirit of Lao Tzu's original text, yet speaks directly to modern lovers--and to the full sweep of their experiences and emotions. A deeply felt alternative to advice books that urge readers to manipulate their partners rather than to love them, The Couple's Tao Te Ching is for everyone who has embarked upon a loving relationship, which, as William Martin says, ""can be the most rewarding and enlightening adventure possible.""Foreword by Hugh and Gayle Prather",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching is not only the single most important text in Chinese spirituality, it is probably the most influential spiritual text in human history. Like all of his translations, Hinton's translation of the Tao Te Ching is mind-opening. It adds startling new dimensions to this text, revealing it as the originary text of deep environmental and feminist thought. In the past, virtually all translations of this text have been produced either by sinologists having little poetic facility in English, or writers having no ability to read the original Chinese. Hinton's fluency in ancient Chinese and his acclaimed poetic ability combine both of these essential qualifications. Together, they allow a breathtaking new translation that reveals how remarkably current and even innovative this text is after 2500 years.",Paperback,,128 pages,"

","Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching,  or ""The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue,"" has probably had a greater influence on Asian thought than any other single book. It is also one of the true classics of world literature.Traditionally attributed to the near-legendary ""Old Master,"" Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching  teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity.",Paperback,,165 pages,"

","Selected for the 2019 Commandant's Professional Reading List J. Glenn Gray entered the army as a private in May 1941, having been drafted on the same day he was informed of his doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. He was discharged as a second lieutenant in October 1945, having been awarded a battlefield commission during fighting in France. Gray saw service in North Africa, Italy, France, and Germany in a counter-espionage unit. Fourteen years after his discharge, Gray began to reread his war journals and letters in an attempt to find some meaning in his wartime experiences. The result is The Warriors, a philosophical meditation on what warfare does to us and an examination of the reasons soldiers act as they do. Gray explains the attractions of battle—the adrenaline rush, the esprit de corps—and analyzes the many rationalizations made by combat troops to justify their actions. In the end, Gray notes, “War reveals dimensions of human nature both above and below the acceptable standards for humanity.”",Paperback,,242 pages,"

","The Library of Congress, considered by many to be the greatest library on earth, holds over 110 million items—books in 450 languages, irreplaceable national documents, priceless art works, and objects of cultural fascination. From a modest collection of 740 books purchased by the Congress in 1800, the Library has grown to house hundreds of miles of bookshelves. Laid end to end, they would stretch from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. This book tells the continuously interesting story of the first two hundred years of the Library of Congress. It is a vast history, filled with an immense cast of characters ranging from presidents, poets, journalists, and congressmen to collectors, artists, curators, and eccentrics. James Conaway centers this history around the thirteen men who have been appointed by presidents to lead the Library of Congress. The author investigates how the Librarians’ experiences and contributions, as well as the Library’s collections, have reflected political and intellectual developments in the United States. Each Librarian confronted great challenges: the entire Library collection was lost when the British burned the Capitol in 1814; in the 1940s, a backlog of one and a half million objects waited to be catalogued; the gigantic task of replacing the card catalogue with a computerized system was undertaken in the 1980s. Yet each Librarian also enjoyed the excitement of acquiring unique treasures—from Walt Whitman’s walking stick to the papers of the Wright brothers, from the Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady to the archives of Leonard Bernstein. This lively account of the Library of Congress and those who guided its progress over two centuries is the history of an American institution that today is truly a library to the world, serving readers and researchers everywhere.",Hardcover,,240 pages,"

This is the story of Gallos and Mondavis, of fortunes made and lost, of dynasties and destinies. In this delightful, full-bodied social history, James Conaway charts the rise of a new aristocracy and, in so doing, chronicles the collective ripening of the American dream.

","In the tradition of his New York Times bestseller, Napa, James Conaway picks up the story he began a decade ago. The Far Side of Eden offers ""a fascinating look at the political side of the wine revolution that put California's Napa Valley on the world map"" (Miami Herald). Now, Conaway reveals, Napa is awash in dollars generated by the boom economy and the social ambitions it inspired. The valley is beset by new arrivals determined to have vineyards of their own and by cult-wine producers in thrall to fabulously expensive ""rocket juice"" (cabernet sauvignon) that few locals can afford - while established families wish to hold on to the old ways, and camp followers get caught up in the glamour of it all. Conaway, long known for his controversial, compulsively readable social reporting, here ""indicts the wave of new-money millionaires from Silicon Valley, who have brought with them gaudy displays of wealth -- building so-called 'McMansions' and planting 'vanity vineyards'"" (Los Angeles Times). ""A cautionary tale . . . [with] a seductive pull"" (San Francisco Chronicle), The Far Side of Eden takes us to the frontlines of America's ongoing conflicts over money, land, and power to tell a story that has ramifications for us all.",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","James Conaway knew there was something wrong with his father before he let himself think about it. The signs were there, in unfocused phone calls and cryptic letters, but for a time they could be ignored. Finally, on a reporting trip to Memphis, his hometown, Conaway visited his parents and faced the facts: his father was sick; he was in the early stages of what proved to be Alzheimer's disease. The dreaded illness is the inspiration for this beautifully written memoir of family and the South. As memory left his father, the author felt moved to recreate the world they had shared, to shore up as many fragments of the past as possible against oblivion. As it happens, many of those fragments are outrageously funny. Memphis Afternoons takes us back to a 1950s society when the rules of southern gentlemanliness were still in effect, if only barely. This is a world where propriety had always fought a dubious battle with bourbon, and now was being defeated by the likes of Elvis Presley. With a rueful wit, Conaway artfully renders a youth of hunting and fishing trips, brawls, and debutante parties, of sexual and alcoholic and literary explorations. The story is told against a wistful background of another generation, his father's, told with a belated appreciation for that generation's ideals, hopes, and its diminished postwar reality. Conaway writes of the idiosyncrasies of his family life with a keen yet tender sense of the absurd, particularly of a sometimes loving, mysterious relationship with his father. Linking the generations is an antiquated but powerful code of conduct, recalled here with extraordinary vividness and humor.",Hardcover,,211 pages,"

","The politics, organized crime, and affluence of the new South come together in World’s End, a parish below New Orleans where the continental United States slides into the Gulf of Mexico. World’s End abounds in oil, racial diversity, and political control as subtle and as absolute as that of a Latin American caudillo. It is bossed by the O’Neills, original Irish settlers in the lower Mississippi Valley. The dynasty is now in the hands of Rory O’Neill, whose patriarchal authority is reminiscent of Willie Stark’s in All the King’s Men, and his son and heir, Bo O’Neill.  As the story opens, Michael Duran, a former assistant district attorney in New Orleans, is summoned by Rory O’Neill and offered a political job raising funds for O’Neill’s candidate for governor, the well-born Strather Ward. O’Neill controls Ward because he knows of the one black mark on his record. O’Neill and the New Orleans district attorney are bitter enemies, but of greater significance is O’Neill’s hatred of the local Mafia, headed by Salvador Cinque, whose cruelly-efficient syndicate competes with the O’Neills.  World’s End (originally published by William Morrow) is a contemporary novel but much of the real world it captures was swept away by hurricane Katrina, so it’s nostalgically bittersweet as well. Intricately plotted, the novel works on several levels — as a family saga, a political thriller, a kind of generational noir, and a love story — and deals not just with power and the ever-changing South but also with the themes of faith, guilt, and retribution.  Passionate, unrelenting, hedonistic, violent, funny and, like the society it portrays, not devoid of beauty, World’s End is a complete and compelling literary experience and an ideal complement to the author’s other New Orleans novel, The Big Easy.  Novelist Michael Mewshaw wrote in the Washington Star when the novel was first published: “Conaway has written a saga which... leads to the conclusion that at the top — at the bottom? — the country is run by an interlocking directorate of corporate executives, mafiosi, elected officials and regional power brokers... What raises the book above its genre is Conaway’s sure knowledge of the place and its people... he knows, for instance, that racketeers in New Orleans wear elastic white socks as a kind of professional badge. And he can describe a Cajun celebration, a morning coffee at Cafe du Monde, or a ritualistic serving of Sambuca just a skillfully as he handles the action sequences.”  New York Daily News, “If tight melodrama laced with sex, power grabs and corruption is your dish, you’ll devour World’s End with the relish of a hungry mule in a cornfield...a spellbinder.”  Kirkus: “This Louisiana tale, with its Mafia crime barons pitted against corrupt-government barons, expertly lifts numerous Puzo-ian scenes and motifs - tit-for-tat violence, family honor - while adding some strong local colorations and cinematic effects... there’s enough action and avarice down among the bayous to make this a solid, never crass or tasteless, commercial entry.”  The Miami Herald: “There is a good deal more to World’s End than just politics. Conaway’s novel is at once a family chronicle, a thriller, and a brief history of Louisiana. It is filled with authentic detail and atmosphere, told with great skill.”  Philadelphia Inquirer: “The teaser on the jacket flap says that James Conaway’s new novel ‘will remind some readers of ‘All the King’s Men’ and others of ‘The Godfather’... The good news is that it’s an astonishingly successful hybrid.",Paperback,,0 pages,"

","James Conaway knew there was something wrong with his father before he let himself think about it. The signs were there, in unfocused phone calls and cryptic letters, but for a time they could be ignored. Finally, on a reporting trip to Memphis, his hometown, Conaway visited his parents and faced the facts: his father was sick; he was in the early stages of what proved to be Alzheimer's disease. The dreaded illness is the inspiration for this beautifully written memoir of family and the South. As memory left his father, the author felt moved to recreate the world they had shared, to shore up as many fragments of the past as possible against oblivion. As it happens, many of those fragments are outrageously funny. Memphis Afternoons takes us back to a 1950s society when the rules of southern gentlemanliness were still in effect, if only barely. This is a world where propriety had always fought a dubious battle with bourbon, and now was being defeated by the likes of Elvis Presley. With a rueful wit, Conaway artfully renders a youth of hunting and fishing trips, brawls, and debutante parties, of sexual and alcoholic and literary explorations. The story is told against a wistful background of another generation, his father's, told with a belated appreciation for that generation's ideals, hopes, and its diminished postwar reality. Conaway writes of the idiosyncrasies of his family life with a keen yet tender sense of the absurd, particularly of a sometimes loving, mysterious relationship with his father. Linking the generations is an antiquated but powerful code of conduct, recalled here with extraordinary vividness and humor.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","En estas páginas, que pueden parecer insuficientes, pero respecto a las cuales puedo garantizar su sinceridad, se hace frecuente alusión a la culpa y a la expiación, puesto que no he podido tener miramientos ni para la sensibilidad de los otros ni para la mía. Sin embargo creo que esta obra, como diagnóstico, se sitúa más allá de la culpa y de la expiación. En ella se describe cómo se sufre la violencia, eso es todo. En este libro no me dirijo a mis compañeros de infortunio. Ellos ya saben. Cada uno debe soportar a su modo el peso de esta experiencia. A los alemanes, por el contrario, que en su aplastante mayoría no se sienten, o no han dejado de sentirse, responsables de los actos al mismo tiempo más sombríos y más característicos del Tercer Reich, me gustaría narrarles algunos hechos que tal vez no les habían sido aún revelados. En definitiva, todavía aliento la esperanza de que este trabajo sirva a una buena causa: entonces podría concernir a todos aquellos que no renuncian a su condición de prójimos.Jean Améry no es el nombre real del autor, sino un pseudónimo, el que Hans Mayer elige cuando a raíz de la anexión de Austria por Alemania en 1938 decide emigrar a Bélgica.Jean Améry (o Hans Mayer) nació en 1912 en Viena, donde estudió Filosofía y Letras. Arrestado y deportado por los alemanes, se escapa del campo de Gurs y se une a la resistencia antinazi en Bélgica. En 1943 es arrestado de nuevo e internado hasta 1945 en el campo de concentración de Auschwitz. Tras la liberación regresa a Bruselas, donde comienza su carrera como escritor y crítico, colaborando, al mismo tiempo, en la radio y la televisión. En 1978 decide quitarse la vida en la ciudad de Salzburgo, en Austria.Otras obras del autor: Charles Bovary, médico rural; Levantar la mano sobre uno mismo (Pre-Textos, 1998); Más allá de la culpa y la expiación (Pre-Textos, 2001); Revuelta y resignación.

","In this new and original book, Alain Lipietz develops a challenging account of the economic and political forces which have shaped the world in the late twentieth century, and outlines a new political agenda for the future. Lipietz analyzes the Fordist model of economic development dominant in the postwar years, and shows how it can be seen to account for the political and economic crisis of the latter decades of the century. Drawing on examples from the recent history of Europe, the Third World and North America, Lipietz argues that there are two intersecting economic reasons for the crisis: the changing international economy and the experience of reaching the limits of Fordist forms of production. He charts the responses of governments and businesses to the weaknesses of Fordism and their proposals for a postfordist future. Lipietz presents a radical critique of the model for solving the crisis prevalent in Anglo-Saxon countries, and outlines his own proposals for its solution, based on the values of solidarity, the autonomy of individuals and ecological responsibility. He puts forward an alternative set of progressive measures to address the social changes of the late twentieth century - the reorganization of work, the future of professional relations, the reform of the welfare state, the development of free time and changes in international relations. Towards a New Economic Order is a major contribution to the study of the political economy of Europe in the last decades of the century. It will be welcomed by students, researchers and practitioners in economics, political science, ecology and international relations.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","In this book Max Koch develops a theoretical model to understand the restructuring of labour markets and social structures of advanced capitalist countries on the basis of the 'regulation approach'. This approach is then applied to comparative analysis of the national trajectories of the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Against the background of the classical sociological theories of Marx and Weber, he examines whether there are general links between inclusion, exclusion and capitalism. This is followed by an outline of key concepts of the regulation approach and a discussion of the transition from Fordism to Post-Fordism which leads to empirically verifiable hypotheses about long-term trends in labour markets and social structures in Western Europe. These hypotheses serve as the theoretical basis for the subsequent country studies that are founded on an evaluation of international labour statistics.",Hardcover,,210 pages,"

","In the fourteen articles collected in this volume, Carol Gilligan and her colleagues expand the theoretical base of In a Different Voice and apply their research methods to a variety of life situations. The contrasting voices of justice and care clarify different ways in which women and men speak about relationships and lend different meanings to connection, dependence, autonomy, responsibility loyalty, peer pressure, and violence. By examining the moral dilemmas and self-descriptions of children, high school students, urban youth, medical students, mothers, lawyers, and others, the authors chart a new terrain: a mapping of the moral domain that includes the voices of women. In this new terrain the authors trace far-reaching implications of the inclusion of women's voices for developmental psychology, for education, for women, and for men.",Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Making Connections maps new territory in the field of psychology. The essays in this volume are ""a series of exercises en route to a new psychology of adolescence and women... [and] part of a process that they also describe: of changing a tradition by including girls' voices, of listening to girls and asking again about the meaning of self, relationship, and morality - concepts central to any psychology of human development... Each essay originated with a question that arose or became clarified in the experience of the research. No attempt has been made to unify these essays or to arrive at a central thesis, beyond the common intention to listen for the ways in which girls orchestrate themes of connection and separation and concerns about care and justice in speaking about themselves, about their relationships, and about experiences of conflict...""When Women's Studies is joined with the study of girls development it becomes clearer why adolescence is a critical time in girls' lives--a time when girls are in danger of losing their voices and thus losing connection with others, and also a time when girls, gaining voice and knowledge, are in danger of knowing the unseen and speaking the unspoken and thus losing connection with what is commonly taken to be 'reality. This crisis of connection in girls' lives at adolescence links the psychology of women with the most basic questions about the nature of relationships and the definition of reality. Girls questions about relationships and about reality, however, also tug at women's silences.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","""Should sound a national alert to society that even our most privileged girls still pursue normal femininity at great risk to personal and civic health.""THE BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBELyn Mike Brown and Carol Gilligan ask ""What, on the way to womanhood, does a girl give up?"" One hundred girls gave voice to what is rarely spoken and often ignored: that the passage out of girlhood is a journey into silence and disconnection, a troubled crossing when a girl loses a firm sense of self and becomes tentative and unsure. These changes mark the endge of adolescence as a watershed in women's psychological development and the stories the girls tell are by turns heartrending and courageous. Listening to these girls provides us with the means of reaching out to them at this critical time, and of better understanding what we as women and men may have left behind at our own crossroads.A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR",Hardcover,,258 pages,"

","In her landmark 1982 study In a Different Voice, Carol Gilligan argues that there is not only one, true moral voice, but two: one masculine, one feminine. Moral values and concerns associated with a feminine outlook are relational rather than autonomous; they depend upon interaction with others. Susan J. Hekman argues that the approach to morality suggested by Gilligan's work marks a radically new departure in moral thinking.In a far-reaching examination and critique of Gilligan's theory, Hekman seeks to deconstruct the major traditions of moral theory that have been dominant since the Enlightenment. She challenges the centerpiece of that tradition: the disembodied, autonomous subject of modernist philosophy. Hekman argues that the logic of Gilligan's approach entails multiple moral voices, not just one or even two, and that factors other than gender--class, race, and culture--are constitutive of moral voice. Using the work of Wittgenstein and Foucault, she outlines the parameters of a discursive morality and its implications for feminism and moral theory.",Unknown Binding,,188 pages,"

","Adolescent girls’special needs in the teen-age years are thoroughly examined in Women, Girls & Psychotherapy, a compelling book focusing on the vitality of resistance in young girls. Drawing on studies of women?s and girls’development, clinical work with girls and women, and their personal experiences, the voices of adolescent girls are used to reframe and greater understand their resistance against debilitating conventions of feminine behavior. As adolescent girls are often overlooked in feminist books in psychotherapy, this is an important volume as it looks positively at resistance, both as a political strategy and a health-sustaining process.The chapters cover such diverse topics as reconceptualizations of women?s and girls’psychological development and the psychotherapy relationship; adolescent female sexuality; new approaches to psychological problems commonly seen in girls and women; female adolescent health; and diverse perspectives and experiences of growing up female. The voices of young women are increasingly important in the exploration of the field of psychotherapy and among the voices included are those from African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and lesbians. An enlightening look at resistance in females in the growing up years, this volume provides valuable insight on their experiences. The work of many researchers,therapists, and educators with diverse backgrounds, Women, Girls & Psychotherapy is an informative book on distinct psychological issues facing young females.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","This profoundly illuminating, entertaining book could well change the way we ""read"" the visual world around us, and certainly help open our eyes and minds to its astonishing riches. The language in which we speak about art has become steadily more abstruse, a jargon that only art critics and con-artists can understand, though for thousands of years this was not the case. Today, we live in a kaleidoscopic new world of images: Is there a vocabulary we can learn in order to read these images? Is there something we can do so as not to remain passive when we flip through an illustrated book, or download images on a screen? Are there ways in which we can ""read"" the stories within paintings, monuments, buildings and sculptures? We say ""every picture tells a story"" - but does it?Taking a handful of extraordinary images - photographed, painted, built, sculpted - Alberto Manguel explores how each one attempts to tell a story that we, the viewer, must decipher or invent. A History of Love and Hate is not about art history or theory - it is about the astonishing pleasures and surprises of stories.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

Artificial intelligence is one way that we may add diversity to our civilization. But in this series we've done it by giving a boost in intelligence to some of our fellow creatures on Planet Earth. Dolphins and apes -- especially -- seem trapped under a ""glass ceiling"" that limits their ability to speak, to argue, to create, to use tools, to invent and take part in Terran culture. But what if we, the first species on Earth to cross the wide gulf of sapience, were to turn around and offer a hand to others?

Dramatic, thought-provoking, and inventive, these books describe a fully realized world rich in character, detail, and ideas. Now Uplift author David Brin collaborates with acclaimed artist Kevin Lenagh to compile the definitive guide to the species, societies, and technology of one of the greatest feats of literary world-building ever accomplished.CONTACTING ALIENSHere in the form of a handbook for Terran field agents is a detailed look at Uplift’s many alien races--from the friendly Tymbrimi to the warlike Tandu, from the wise and enigmatic Kanten to the fiercely reptilian Soro, from the bureaucratic Hoon to the manipulative Thennanin--their physiology, psychology, history; their clans and alliances; and their shifting attitudes toward Earth and its representatives.Here, too, is a history of Earth’s contact and challenging interactions with the mysterious and powerful Civilization of Five Galaxies, a look at its institutions, languages, and customs, plus a time line of momentous events going back 3 billion years. For the millions of fans of the Uplift novels, this long-awaited guide will be an essential reference work, filled with vital information and never-before-seen illustrations that reveal, for the first time in one volume, the keys to the ambitious vision and bold speculation of the Uplift universe.From the Trade Paperback edition.",Paperback,,191 pages,"

The author examines the transformation of the narrator's discourse in the adaptation process and discusses the meaning conveyed by signs and sign systems unique to the filmic text and its medium, including lighting, foregrounding and backgrounding, and the soundtrack. In his analysis, the author demonstrates how filmmakers use sign systems unique to film to add and/or alter meanings conveyed in the literary texts on which their films were based.""",Hardcover,,249 pages,"

At the same time he tried to discover what makes different countries play a simple game so differently.Kuper meets a remarkable variety of fans along the way, from the East Berliner persecuted by the Stasi for supporting his local team, to the Argentine general with his own views on tactics. He also illuminates the frightening intersection between soccer and politics, particularly in the wake of the attacks of 9-11, where soccer is obsessed over by the likes of Osama bin Laden. The result is one of the world's most acclaimed books on the game, and an astonishing study of soccer and its place in the world.",Paperback,,302 pages,"

","In this compelling study of the treatment of ""enemy"" minorities in the Russian Empire during the First World War, Eric Lohr uncovers a dramatic story of mass deportations, purges, expropriations, and popular violence.A campaign initially aimed at restricting foreign citizens rapidly spun out of control. It swept up Russian subjects of German, Jewish, and Muslim backgrounds and drove roughly a million civilians from one part of the empire to another, resulting in one of the largest cases of forced migration in history to that time. Because foreigners and diaspora minorities were prominent among entrepreneurial and landowning elites, the campaign against them also became an explosive element in class and national tensions on the eve of the 1917 revolutions.During the war, the imperial regime dropped its ambivalence about Russian nationalism and embraced unprecedented and radical policies that ""nationalized"" the economy, the land, and even the population. The core idea of the campaign--that the country needed to free itself from the domination of foreigners, internal enemies, and the exploitative world economic system--later became a central feature of the Soviet revolutionary model.Based on extensive archival research, much in newly available sources, Nationalizing the Russian Empire is an important contribution to the study of empire and nationalism, the Russian Revolution, and ethnic cleansing.",Hardcover,,237 pages,"

","A best-selling author investigates the causes of the twentieth century's deadliest race riot and how its legacy has scarred and shaped a community over the past eight decades.On a warm night in May 1921, thousands of whites, many deputized by the local police, swarmed through the Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma, killing scores of blacks, looting, and ultimately burning the neighborhood to the ground. In the aftermath, as many as 300 were dead, and 6,000 Greenwood residents were herded into detention camps.James Hirsch focuses on the de facto apartheid that brought about the Greenwood riot and informed its eighty-year legacy, offering an unprecedented examination of how a calamity spawns bigotry and courage and how it has propelled one community's belated search for justice. Tulsa's establishment and many victims strove to forget the events of 1921, destroying records pertaining to the riot and refusing even to talk about it. This cover-up was carried through the ensuing half-century with surprising success. Even so, the riot wounded Tulsa profoundly, as Hirsch demonstrates in a compelling combination of history, journalism, and character study. White Tulsa thrived, and the city became a stronghold of Klan activity as workingmen and high civic officials alike flocked to the Hooded Order. Meanwhile, Greenwood struggled as residents strove to rebuild their neighborhood despite official attempts to thwart them. As the decades passed, the economic and social divides between white and black worlds deepened. Through the 1960s and 1970s, urban renewal helped to finish what the riot had started, blighting Greenwood. Paradoxically, however, the events of 1921 saved Tulsa from the racial strife that befell so many other American cities in the 1960s, as Tulsans white and black would do almost anything to avoid a reprise of the riot.Hirsch brings the riot's legacy up to the present day, tracing how the memory of the massacre gradually revived as academics and ordinary citizens of all colors worked tirelessly to uncover evidence of its horrors. Hirsch also highlights Tulsa's emergence at the forefront of the burgeoning debate over reparations. RIOT AND REMEMBRANCE shows vividly, chillingly, how the culture of Jim Crow caused not only the grisly incidents of 1921 but also those of Rosewood, Selma, and Watts, as well as less widely known atrocities. It also addresses the cruel irony that underlies today's battles over affirmative action and reparations: that justice and reconciliation are often incompatible goals. Finally, Hirsch details how Tulsa may be overcoming its horrific legacy, as factions long sundered at last draw together.",Hardcover,,358 pages,"

","In the middle of a steamy Calcutta night the phone rings. An unnamed man in a city of millions answers to a voice telling him that his long-lost sister is dead. He must go to the hospital to identify the body and claim his sister's orphaned newborn daughter until she can be adopted the next day.During the long hot night, the baby sleeps on a bedspread that used to be indigo blue, but has faded to almost white. As the child lies where the man and his sister used to sleep as children, he quietly writes stories for her, telling of his own childhood full of intensity, anguish, and poetry. He doesn't know his place in the world, but with the help of these stories, the baby someday might.Raj Kamal Jha's ethereal, poetic prose echoes the loneliness of the human condition.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Look at the picture on the cover, there's a child, a girl in a red dress; there's a bird, a crow in a blue white sky. And then there are a few things you cannot see. -f r o m If You Are Afraid of HeightsBut the crow sees everything: In Part One, a man and a woman meet in a midnight road accident and fall in love. In Part Two, a reporter arrives in a small town to uncover the story of a child's rape and murder. In Part Three, a young girl, shaken by suicides in her neighborhood, begins to fear for her parents' lives. And the lives of all of these characters overlap and intersect in a magical realm that lies somewhere between fantasy and reality. Ultimately, multiple coincidences and recurring motifs pull the parts together and reveal the ways in which all three tales are both their own stories and the many sides of one story.

","American Politicians presents a marvellous collection of images, from Mathew Brady's indelible portraits of Abraham Lincoln to the carefully staged ""photo opportunities"" of today. Among them are icons of political photography - Calvin Coolidge wearing a Native American headdress, Fiorello La Guardia reading comics over the radio, Harry Truman playing piano for Lauren Bacall, Lyndon Johnson displaying the scar from his surgery. Also reproduced are many rare photographs of both prominent and obscure practitioners of the rites of American politics, caught unrelentingly by the camera. The pictures have been selected from an array of public and private collections, including those of the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, the Museum of the City of New York, the New-York Historical Society, the Chicago Historical Society. The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the archives of photo agencies, newspapers, and magazines. Many of the photographs in this book are the work of professional news photographers, but after World War II, independent artists offered alternative views, represented here by the photographs of Robert Frank in the 1950s, Garry Winogrand and Elliott Erwitt in the 1960s, Larry Fink in the 1970s, and Judith Joy Ross in the 1980s. Despite unceasing advances in visual technology, which simultaneously aid and hinder photographers, and despite the best efforts of political handlers, both newsmen and independents continue to make the pictures that help to create and confirm the image of ourselves we see reflected in our politicians.",Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","In American Children, sixty photographs from the collection of The Museum of Modern Art provide a historical survey of the changing concept of childhood as reflected in American photography from the middle of the nineteenth century to 1978. Photographs taken during the 1840s, 50s, and 60s capture the Victorian sense of the child as a solemn miniature adult. As the expressive capabilities of the medium developed, the Photo-Secessionists idealized children in settings of complete harmony and beauty, while social reformers such as Lewis Hine and Jacob Riis documented the deplorable conditions of the urban slum children. During the 1920s there was a concern with beauty of form, as evidenced in Edward Weston's photographs of his son Neil, while the Farm Security Administration photographers of the 1903s portrayed young victims of the Depression. In the 1940s, equipped with a smaller camera and faster film, street photographers such as Helen Levitt captured the private fantasies of city children at play. The postwar years brought a renewal of family values and a new approach to photographing children; it also resulted in an increasing awareness of adolescent sexuality and of childhood as a complex psychological period.This book confirms that photographing children remains special, as the author states, ""for children still live out their fantasies as part of their reality, and sensitive adult photographers share this proclivity. Because they keep alive the child in themselves, they understand and can capture the elements of fantasy in the child's subtle and fleeting array of gestures and movements.""Photographers whose work is represented in the book include Diane Arbus, Harry Callahan, Walker Evans, Robert Frank, Lee Friedlander, Lewis Hine, Gertrude Käsebier, Jacob Riis, Edward Weston, and Clarence White, among many others.Susan Kismaric is Associate Curator in the Department of Photography of The Museum of Modern Art.",Hardcover,,80 pages,"

","The past has long fingers into the present, but they are not just the fingers of fact. How we remember the past is at least as important as the objective facts of that past. The memories used by a people to define itself have to be understood not just as (sometimes) bad history but also as historical artifacts themselves. Texas’ pasts are examined in this groundbreaking volume, featuring chapters by a wide range of scholars.Current historians’ views of Texas in the nineteenth century and especially the significance of the Alamo as a site of memory in architecture, art, and film across the years comprise a major element of this volume. Other nineteenth-century historical events are also examined through their memorializations in the twentieth century: the construction of Civil War monuments by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, public and private Juneteenth celebrations, and the Tejano memorial on the Capitol grounds commemorating the history of Mexicans in Texas. Twentieth-century chapters include collective memories and meaning attached to the Ku Klux Klan, the significance of the civil rights movement in the eyes of different generations of Texans, and the lasting (or fading) Texan memories of Lyndon Baines Johnson.The volume editors offer these studies as a model of how Texas historians can begin to incorporate memory into their work, as historians of other regions have done. In the process, they offer a more nuanced and even a more applied version of Texas history than many of us learned in school.",Paperback,,324 pages,"

","Long ago the Tripods, gigantic three-legged machines, descended upon Earth and took control. They used ""Caps,"" administered ceremoniously near each child's 14th birthday, to control humans' brains and keep them docile. Now there is pleasant life in villages, little technology, and no war--but there is no freedom either. In this powerful and suspenseful series, 13-year-old Will Parker and his friends deal with hunger, humanity, envy, and pride as they struggle to find out all they can about the Tripods and overthrow their rule. Written by John Christopher, author of many juvenile science fiction and fantasy books, The Tripods Trilogy is sure to make a science fiction fan out of any reader--young or old. This box set of paperbacks includes The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire, the chilling conclusion to the series that poses the question: Who would rule the world if it were freed from the aliens?

Beginning in the present volume, The Knight, to be concluded next year in The Wizard, The Wizard Knight is in the rare company of those works that spring from the myth and literature of past ages, not last year's genre fantasy series. A teenager passes from our world to a magical realm of seven worlds, where he is soon given the body of a mature man of heroic proportions. Forced to act as a man, inside he remains a boy, even as he sets off to find his destined sword and become a knight. His quest is filled with danger and adventure, giants, elves, and dragons. And a literally enchanting romance. The Knight is a thrilling, charming, emotionally-riveting tale of wonders, written with the stylistic clarity and beauty we have come to expect of Gene Wolfe at his best.",Hardcover,,432 pages,"

","This gripping legal thriller illustrates the ambiguity of justice, where an innocent man dangles fourteen years on death row before gaining his hard-won freedom. Based on the true story of Joe Brown and his young, court-appointed defense attorney, this book examines the illusion of a neutral or impartial jury, particularly in a capital murder trial of a young black man in the South. The attorney's insight into the lengthy appeals process causes one to question the ultimate sentence of society; the death penalty; and the fight for life that ensues once it has been mandated.In broad strokes, this legal thriller paints a picture of the U.S. criminal justice system. Upon closer inspection, individual brush strokes reveal the underlying themes of racial and socio-economic prejudice, the concept of a neutral jury in capital murder trials, and the ;good old boy; brand of justice so prevalent, still, in law enforcement agencies, courtrooms and judges' chambers, not just in Florida, where this story takes place, but throughout the United States.Although this is a work of fiction, and some of the names and places have been changed, the details of this story closely reflect the original case history and trial circumstances.",Paperback,,281 pages,"

Taking as his framework diplomatic postings to Berlin, Ghana, Bonn, Bucharest and New York, and later his unexpected secondment to Buckingham Palace, Shea regales us with vivid behind-the-scenes encounters with awesome dictators like Nicolae Ceaucescu as well as minor tyrants like media magnate Robert Maxwell; spies and counter-spies in a Cold War Europe straight out of Le Carre; glittering banquets with US presidents and desert potentates; and the pleasures and perils of aminding' the great and the good, from Harold Wilson to Princess Diana, from Margaret Thatcher to the Queen.We remember the famous and the infamous for their great public moments but, as Michael Shea demonstrates, it is the tiny incidents, the facial expression or remark caught off camera, that really define the wisdom or weakness of those who have impressed or shocked us. Witty and incisive, A View from the Sidelines takes us right up close to our icons, sometimes revealing their feet of clay.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","When human beings first arrived in North America at the end of the last Ice Age, they encountered a teeming variety of animals, from ground sloths and mastodons to zebras and camels. This spectacularly illustrated book takes us on a captivating journey back to that time, showing us the entire continent and its incredible wildlife as it looked 13,000 years ago. The book travels the ancient continent region by region, from the icy Arctic vastness to the steamy tropical swamps of Florida. We are introduced to bizarre beasts, now extinct (including glyptodonts, scimitar-toothed cats, and mammoths); animals that have long since disappeared from their North American habitats (lions, cheetahs); and species still seen today (grizzlies, condors, alligators). A wealth of fossil evidence informs the stunning computer-generated panoramas that fill the pages of this extraordinary book. The bones of the ancient beasts again have flesh and fur, unfamiliar animals again roam the landscapes, and the world of prehistoric North America comes startlingly to life.",Hardcover,,192 pages,"

When she receives a letter from a grandmother she never knew existed, Carla asks questions, but her mother refuses to discuss the past. Left without recourse, she journeys to Dunleavy Farm in Kentucky.An opportunity of a lifetime…The once-renowned racehorse farm amazes Carla, and so does her grandmother. Octavia Whitworth Dunleavy—the formidable matriarch of the family—wants to pass her legacy to her three grandchildren. But is Carla ready to put her jet-setting lifestyle aside? And why had her mother denied the family connection?A chance for love…If the skeletons rattling the family closet weren’t enough, Wade Petrie, the handsome cowboy who manages Dunleavy Farm, certainly has Carla’s heart fluttering. He’s infuriating and entirely too opinionated for her liking. But when danger strikes the elderly Octavia and the Dunleavy reputation is at risk, can Carla trust Wade to help them—or will the secrets he keeps overshadow all her dreams?Bestselling author Janis Flores (aka Risa Kirk) weaves a rich tale of deception, hope, and love in Done Driftin’, the first classic romance in the Dunleavy Legacy trilogy.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

As an over-sixty today you are likely to be very much healthier than previous generations of retirees and you're close to outnumbering the younger age group. So why should they have all the fun?

","JUHA ILMARI LEIVISKA has enjoyed a distinguished career as one of Finland's leading architects. This book provides a perceptive account of his work to date, locating it within both Finnish modernism and that of Dutch De Stijl. Leiviska's profound interest in architectural history has not led him to mere imitation of historic forms: even in his faithful adherence to the principles of De Stijl he succeeds in dissolving its formal vocabulary of abstraction by his uncanny and totally unnerving use of daylight. What is reflected in Professor Quantrill's authoritative account is not only Leiviska's sensitivity to the chemistry of built form when immersed in light, but the interaction of physical form and musical structure in his designs. Born in Helsinki in 1936, Leiviska studied architecture at Helsinki's celebrated University of Technology in Otaniemi. After graduating in 1959, he began lecturing there on the history of architecture, and continued to do so until 1971. His architectural practice dates from 1964, when he was only 28, and his best known and most admired work - both executed buildings and projects - has centred on the design of religious buildings for the Lutheran Church. The qualities of his architecture, as well as his own uniquely personal talents as a designer, have been widely recognised since the completion of St Thomas's Parish Church and Centre in Oulu (1975). Leiviska was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in 1991, and was appointed as an 'Artist Professor' by the Finnish President in 1992. In 1994 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was awarded the prestigious Carlsberg Prize in 1995, and in 1997 he followed Alvar Aalto and Reima Pietila in becoming the architecture Member of the Academy of Finland.",Paperback,,127 pages,"

","A true classic novel in Finnish literature, Juha was written by Juhani Aho, the uncontested grand old man of Finnish Literature at the turn of the 20th century. Juhani Aho was a member of the turn-of-the-century Young Finland (Nuori Suomi) circle of artists that included artist Akseli Gallén-Kallela and composer Jean Sibelius. Juha has proven to be a timeless, perpetually relevant work of art, a classic triangle drama with Finnish trappings. Juha has inspired several generations of filmmakers; it has been made into film no less than four times: Mauritz Stiller’s silent movie, 1919 (Johan), Nyrki Tapiovaara’s classic film Juha, 1937 with Aho’s son Björn Soldan as cinematographer, T.J. Särkkä made a colour version in 1957 and, of course, Aki Kaurismäki crowned the effort with his silent, black & white Juha of 1998.Juha is characterized by deceptively simple yet multilayered language. The translator, the eminent stylist Dr. Richard Impola, captures the depth of emotion and fine nuances in the relationships, in particular between Marja and Juha.Introduction by Professor Börje Vähämäki, the University of Toronto.",Paperback,,172 pages,"

The material can be roughly divided into three different types: classical, standard but sometimes with a new twist, and recent. The author first studies basic covering theorems and their applications to analysis in metric measure spaces. This is followed by a discussion on Sobolev spaces emphasizing principles that are valid in larger contexts. The last few sections of the book present a basic theory of quasisymmetric maps between metric spaces. Much of the material is recent and appears for the first time in book format.",Hardcover,,141 pages,"

","The energy of Eros is powerful--alluring, fascinating, compelling. Many people--especially those who are single or celibate by choice or by circumstance--struggle with the containment of erotic energies. Many people in all walks of life wonder how sexuality and spirituality can live together in harmony. The instinctual energy of Eros and the compelling archetype of Self fire and guide the desires that lead to psychological growth and ultimate spiritual development. These issues were central to Jung as he began to formulate his theories over against Freud's. The Fires of Desire explores the consequences of Jung's split with Freud over the nature of libido as sexual energy and describes the vicissitudes of that energy's unfolding. The central question is: What is the nature of erotic energy and how may it be transmuted? Just as Jung looked to mythology and the alchemical mysteries of medieval Europe to find answers from the realm of the deep psyche, today one continues to wonder: How is the lead of life transformed into gold? How are ordinary erotic energies transmuted into the passionate yearning that leads the soul to mystical union with the Divine? In this book leading Jungians--psychotherapists, analysts, educators, and theologians--revisit the issue that created the Freud/Jung split and attempt to reformulate our understanding of Eros in relation to Spirit. The Fires of Desire follows a developmental path depicting human experience. It marks out the similarities and differences between psychosis and mystical experience. It sketches the structure of feminine and masculine development. It looks at the process of psychospiritual growth and at the transformations of religious experience.

","Imagine earthy Tolkienesque characters in a setting full of cemeteries, graverobbers, necromancers, corpse-eaters--even a huge labyrinthine necropolis. Imagine mephitic gardens where the sarcophage, selenotrope, and necrophilium bloom. Then throw in star-crossed lovers, crazed zealots, stalwart heroes, bloodthirsty renegade armies, hideous monsters, and likeable misfits. You've got just a hint of the wondrous and original visions in the dark fantasy world of Brian McNaughton.  Horror scholar S. T. Joshi, in the afterword to this collection of stories, notes the strong influence of Clark Ashton Smith, Lord Dunsany, H. P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Greco-Roman decadent works such as Petronius's Satyricon. ""McNaughton seems to have mastered one of the most difficult of literary arts: to draw upon the classics of the field without losing his own voice.... The world that McNaughton has created in this book is the world of the ghoul; and who knows but that The Throne of Bones will become the standard textbook for the care and feeding of ghouls just as Dracula has become that for vampires?""Contents:Ringard and Dendra (1996)The Throne of Bones (1997)The Vendren Worm (1990)Meryphillia (1990)Reunion in Cephalune (1997)The Art of Tiphytsorn Glocque (1997)A Scholar from Sythiphore (1995)Vendriel and Vendreela (1988)The Retrograde Necromancer (1993)The Return of Liron Wolfbaiter (1997)",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Alain Robbe-Grillet is internationally hailed as the chief spokesman for the noveau roman and one of the great novelists of the twentieth century. The Erasers, his first novel, reads like a detective story but is primarily concerned with weaving and then probing a complete mixture of fact and fantasy. The narrative spans the twenty-four-hour period following a series of eight murders in eight days, presumably the work of a terrorist group. After the ninth murder, the investigation is then turned over to a police agent, who may in fact be the assassin.Both an engrossing mystery and a sinister deconstruction of reality, The Erasers intrigues and unnerves with equal force as it pull us along to its ominous conclusion.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Reminiscent of Orson Welles's The Third Man, Repetition is an atmospheric spy novel of violence, mystery, and tricks of the eye, set in a bombed-out 1949 Berlin. Henri Robin, a special agent of the French secret service, arrives in the ruined city and feels linked to it by a vague and recurrent memory. There is a shooting, a kidnapping, druggings, encounters with pimps and teenage whores, police interrogations, even torture. Bits and pieces of the Oedipus story resonate through the book's elegant labyrinth as Robin slowly senses that he was in Berlin before - as a child, with his mother, perhaps looking for his father. A brilliantly executed novel in prose of an almost hallucinatory richness, Repetition is proof that Robbe-Grillet's vision is, in a time of identity theft and porous nationhood, more relevant than ever.",Paperback,,208 pages,"

","PUBLISHED IN FRENCH. Jealousy, the old standby in fiction and drama, is the subject of this short French novel set on a banana plantation in the West Indies. Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie treats a traditional situation (husband, wife, outsider) in a fascinating, detective-story-like way. Readers discover as they read what is happening and speculate on how to interpret the incidents related. The whole fascination of the novel lies in the question: What really happened? It can be raised almost at every page. No two critics ever agree on the answer. Questions, given in French, as notes, serve to alert readers to the significance of certain facts and give them a grasp of the techniques Robbe-Grillet uses. The general introduction, in English, briefly discusses the significance of the ""new novel,"" Robbe-Grillet's particular theories, and attempts to place La Jalousie in perspective without giving away clues to the solution of the story, which readers will want to find for themselves.",Paperback,,129 pages,"

","What do rabbis have to say about intermarriage? Nearly all Jews have an opinion and all Jews have a stake concerning intermarriage. Each member of the tribe is considered precious and irreplaceable. Passions about intermarriage, debates about how to prevent it or reap benefits from its consequences have at their core a genuine concern about group survival. Rabbis are by definition at the center of these issues. Rabbis face daily decisions about whether or not to perform wedding ceremonies with intermarried couples, how to counsel interfaith couples, what they will teach their congregants about intermarriage, and how interfaith families fit into the synagogue. Rabbis Talk About Intermarriage takes a broad, thorough, contemporary look at the diverse rabbinic response to intermarriage and the conflicts it has produced.",Paperback,,186 pages,"

","To most Jewish immigrants New York was America. Not many ventured as far as North Dakota at the turn of the century. Sophie Trupin writes of her father and other Jewish farmers who came to the northern plains: ""Each was a Moses in his own right, leading his people out of the land of bondage—out of czarist Russia, out of anti-Semitic Poland, out of Romania and Galicia. Each was leading his family to a promised land; only this was no land flowing with milk and honey—no land of olive trees and vineyards."" Dakota Diaspora adds a little-known chapter to the saga of the settlement of America. In a series of vignettes Sophie Tmpin recalls her childhood in ""Nordokota,"" where her father built a sod house and farmed a quarter-section of rocky land before opening a butcher shop in the town of Wing. Against that background plays out the perennial conflict between her father; who had escaped the violent anti-Semitism of his native Russia and found here a man's freedom and dignity, and her mother; who felt ""trapped, betrayed and helpless in this desolate land,"" far from her roots in the Old Country. But out of the struggle to bring in the harvest, survive the blizzards, and maintain a kosher home, a warm family life developed, as well as a sense of community with Jewish neighbors on scattered homesteads.",Paperback,,160 pages,"

","In performance ""The Merchant of Venice"" often proves a problematic blend of romantic artifice and social realism. Especially since the last century, the figure of Shylock has focused attention on the play's anti-Semitism. Does Shakespeare promote a comic Jewish stereotype, or use that stereotype only to overturn it? Or does he expose the Christians as the true villains and Shylock as his victim? No production of ""The Merchant"" can be politically or socially disinterested: over the years, the play has tended to arouse more passion and to prompt more theatrical experimentation than any other Shakespearian comedy. The author examines the major solutions directors have offered for staging this ""problem"" play, from Henry Irving onwards. Recent productions such as the Miller/Olivier (1970), the Alexander/Sher (1987), and the two televised ""Merchants"" (1973, 1980) have adapted the play to accommodate or challenge contemporary sensibilities and prejudices. Considering the play's popularity, not only in England and North America but in post-Holocaust Germany and even in Israel, this volume explores the ways in which ""The Merchant"" has served to test changing cultural attitudes towards race, religion, gender and theatrical practice.",Unknown Binding,,164 pages,"

Such a detour, with its various discomforts, is used to penetrate a current historical and political historiography, rendering Shylock a character that remembers various languages and locations, as well as multiple alternatives for political self-definition. This complex Shakespearean character speaks in many voices and for various purposes and is the only character that can provide the missing link between two contradictory Jewish stereotypes - a persecuted and victimized underling and a merciless and violent plaintive, holding out his knife to draw blood.",Hardcover,,247 pages,"

","The Target is an interarts study of Pop art and metafiction. It highlights the relationship between Alain Robbe-Grillet, an internationally acclaimed French new novelist and cinematographer, and Jasper Johns, an internationally renowned artist. Robbe-Grillet wrote ""The Target,"" an introduction to the catalog for the Johns 1978 exhibition in Paris--an introduction in the guise of fiction--that was generated by the works in the show. Fifty-six of the works illustrate the translation of Robbe-Grillet's narrative. Eight additional illustrations in color accompany the essay that analyzes Johns's targets and numbers and Robbe-Grillet's ""target."" The accompanying essay addresses topics such as self-reflexivity, topologies, chaos theory, and the social function of art. The book shows how Johns's targets and Robbe-Grillet's writing subvert social codes and the observer's expectations in order to produce new and unexpected perceptions of reality.",Hardcover,,115 pages,"

","Emerging early in the 1950s as an articulate and provocative spokesman for the new novel, Alain Robbe-Grillet has remained one of the world's leading practitioners of experimental narrative. He continues to reinvent the genre in ways that challenge the conventions of traditional realism, much of the time bewildering readers and critics with his subversion of narrative structure and of such staples of traditional fiction as character, plot, and chronology. In this introduction to the French writer, Roch C. Smith suggests that despite the initial shock often felt on a first encounter with Robbe-Grillet, reading his work can be great fun for someone willing to tolerate defamiliarization and ambiguity and to become an interactive traveller through his narrative mazes. With this exploration of Robbe-Grillet's novels, short stories and autobiographies, Smith offers a guide for the adventuresome reader to the writer's labyrinthine and playful world.",Hardcover,,192 pages,"

","Featuring two first-person interviews with the major contemporary French man of letters, this work investigates the relationships between Alain Robbe-Grillet's experimental writing (novels, picto-novels, auto-fictions, films, and essays) and developments in a number of fields of contemporary inquiry - new sciences (quantum mechanics, chaos theory, and contemporary biology, among others), poststructuralism, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Bringing together the ghosts in the apparently contradictory pair of science and sexuality, Ramsay suggests a connection between concepts of the world as complementary and chaotic and the sado-erotic character of Robbe-Grillet's work. At this intersection, she argues, the analogy sheds light on both the obsessive nature of Robbe-Grillet's metaphors and on the troubling presence of sexual violence in postmodern texts.",Hardcover,,312 pages,"

","The Jokes of Sigmund Freud unravels the intimate connections between Sigmund Freud and his Jewish identity. Author Elliott Oring observes that Freud frequently identified with the characters in the jokes he told, and that there was a strong relationship between these jokes and his own psychological and social state. This analysis offers novel insights into the enigmatic character of Freud and a fresh perspective on the nature of the science that he founded.",Paperback,,168 pages,"

","""Adds significant new insights into the mental, psychological, and rhetorical laboratory of three major contemporary French novelists. . . . Its rigorous focus on autofictional narratives also reflects the widening of the scope of contemporary critical theory and practice.""--Raymond Gay-Crosier, University of Florida Raylene Ramsay explores the significance of the new autobiographical genre--the ""autofictions""--that emerged from the nouveau roman in the 1980s in France. She focuses on the work of Nathalie Sarraute, Marguerite Duras, and Alain Robbe-Grillet, major figures of French avant-garde writing whose complex autobiographies slide between true and false memories and between fact and fiction, examining the limits imposed by the conventions of the traditional autobiography.  While she questions the ability of memory to capture the past and the ability of language to record the experience of an ever-elusive self, Ramsay grounds the three authors in their particular historical, political, and sexual context. In this light she reads Sarraute's negative portrait of her mother, Duras' lyrical evocations of the intensity and pain of desire, and Robbe-Grillet's pirouetting ""confession"" of his family's anti-Semitism and pro-German feeling during World War II as deriving from the individuated (the ""auto"" and the ""bios"") rather than from the collective (the ""graphy""), the forms of a shared language.  In the final instance, Ramsay claims, the new autobiography, seeking individuated truths, offers the power to rewrite inner life--for example, Sarraute comes to identify with the ""feminine"" in the self; Duras casts the writing of her relationship with her Chinese lover as a form of liberation; even Robbe-Grillet, staging his predilection for young girls as the most banal of stereotyped sexual impulses, comes closer to self-knowing. She broadens the scope of her study by showing how this new kind of writing reflects contemporary critical movements, such as postmodernism and the scientific theory of ""complementarity,"" as it telescopes the private and the public, the past experience and the present writing. Raylene Ramsay is professor of French at Auckland University in New Zealand. She is the author of Robbe-Grillet and Modernity: Science, Sexuality, and Subversion (UPF, 1992) and of many articles in journals such as French Review, College Literature, Language Quarterly, European Studies Journal, and Literature and History.",Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","Sieben Mal verfilmt. In unzähligen Auflagen Millionen Leser begeistert. Dreimal ins Fernsehserienformat gepreßt. Tausende von Bühnenaufführungen erlebt. Als Comic die Jugend erreicht. Im Alltag einer ganzen Nation verankert. Hier handelt es sich nicht um Shakespeare oder Star Wars, sondern um einen Stoff aus der kriegerischen Epoche Japans am Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts. Worum geht es? Eiji Yoshikawa begleitet in seinem Roman Musashi den Lebensweg eines Samurai von dessen erster Teilnahme als grobschlächtiger Bauerntölpel an einer verlorenen Schlacht bis zum triumphalen Sieg über seinen größten Rivalen unter den Schwertkämpfern. Zwischen diesen beiden Ereignissen liegt für Musashi ein langer, entbehrlicher Weg des Schwertes, der geprägt ist von einsamen Tagen der Askese, brutaler Selbstdisziplin und körperlicher Züchtigung sowie unstillbarem Hunger nach Wissen und der Suche nach der Erleuchtung. Diesem Erdbeben in Menschengestalt, das sich seine Bahn durch die japanische Geschichte schlägt, stehen mehrere Figuren zur Seite, deren Schicksal mit dem seinen eng verwoben sind und deren Wege sich im Laufe der Zeit immer wieder kreuzen. So reist ihm seine seine platonische Liebe Otsu ebenso lange hinterher wie die verbitterte Alte Osugi, die durch ein Duell mit ihm ihre Familienehre wiederherstellen möchte. Viele verlieren bei einem Aufeinandertreffen mit Musashi ihr Leben, nur wenige Zeitgenossen können ein Band der Freundschaft mit ihm knüpfen. Doch seinen Weg zum furchtlosen, unbesiegbaren Samurai muß er alleine gehen. Miyamoto Musashi ist eine historische Figur. Er selbst hat Das Buch der fünf Ringe, eine Schrift über die Kriegskunst, verfaßt, den Stil der Zwei-Schwert-Technik, zahlreiche kalligraphische sowie einige poetische Werke geschaffen und galt als äußerst hart gegen seine Mitmenschen und sich selbst. Sich stark an den historischen Ereignissen orientierend, schuf Yoshikawa dank seiner meisterhaften Erzählkunst einen Roman, der sowohl den Alltag, als auch die Kultur und Philosophie im japanischen Mittelalter lebendig werden läßt. Auf über 1.200 Seiten entführt er den Leser in eine vergangene fremde Welt, gespickt mit fernöstlicher Sitte und Würde, gelebten buddhistischen Weisheiten und dem lebendigen, alltäglichen Treiben der Stadt- und Landbevölkerung. Wer dieses Stück Weltliteratur für sich entdeckt hat, wird davon so begeistert sein, daß er dieses Buch wirklich uneingeschränkt empfehlen wird. Zum Schluß noch ein kleiner Tip. Um auf die zen-buddhistische Komponente des Romans nicht teilweise verzichten zu müssen, sollte man unbedingt auf die ungekürzte Fassung zurückgreifen. --Andreas Kerschner",Paperback,,791 pages,"

","Miyamoto Musashi es, quizás, el más famoso de todos los samurais que poblaron la época feudal del Japón. Vivió en unos tiempos convulsos, en los cuales Japón se recuperaba de una guerra civil que desencadenó el inicio del shogunato Tokugawa, y donde la nueva paz reinante reformulaba una serie de reformas sociales que afecta ba de forma especial a los ronin, aquellos samurais que, como Musashi, carecían de amo. Musashi, escrita por Eiji Yoshikawa y publicada inicialmente por entregas entre 1935 y 1939, rápidamente se convirtió en todo un éxito al tiempo que se ha ido haciendo con un hueco cada vez más importante en el panorama tanto nipón como del resto del mundo. Con su mezcla de ficción y realidad es una obra fundamental para acceder al mito, gozando de una popularidad e influencia inigualables que siguen acrecentándose a medida que pasan los años. Pero Musashi es además una novela en la mejor tradición de la narrativa japonesa. Es un relato vivo, sutil e imaginativo, rebosante de personajes memorables, que pinta vívidamente un mundo que durante mucho tiempo fue impenetrable para Occidente. Llena de brío y humor, posee una épica repleta de calidad y un atractivo universal. Ha sido llevada a la gran pantalla en numerosas ocasiones. El actor Toshiro Mifune interpretó a Miyamoto Musashi en la saga Samurai, cuya primera parte obtuvo el Oscar a la mejor película de habla no inglesa en 1955. Musashi ha progresado en el Camino de la Espada y sus tempranos éxitos empiezan a hacer de él un espadachín de renombre. Durante su peregrinaje vence a los estudiantes de la prestigiosa escuela Yoshioka de Kyoto, quienes heridos en su orgullo no están muy dispuestos a aceptar su derrota. Musashi es desafiado a un duelo con Seijuro, el joven maestro de los Yoshioka, quien espera poder vengar a su escuela y restablecer el prestigio perdido...

Peter Lance, author of the highly acclaimed 1000 Years for Revenge and Cover Up, returns to uncover the story of Ali Mohamed, a trusted security advisor of Osama bin Laden who hoodwinked the United States for more than a decade. As Lance reveals for this first time, this one man served in a series of high-security position within the United States security establishment, as a Special Forces advisor, FBI informant, and CIA operative, while simultaneously helping orchestrate the al Qaeda campaign of terror that led to 9/11. In October 2000, after tricking three U.S. intelligence agencies for almost two decades, Ali Mohamed appeared in handcuffs and a blue prison jumpsuit in a Federal District courtroom on Manhattan's Lower East Side, where he pleaded guilty five times. His crimes included brokering terror summits, financing an attack on two Black Hawk helicopters, training jihadis in improvised bomb building and the creation of secret cells. And yet, for decades Mohamed had lived the life of a Silicon Valley computer executive. How did this evildoer move in and out of and around the U.S.? is just one of the questio Leakgate, Mohamed appears at nearly every crucial turn of America's terror probes. An important final piece to the 9/11 investigation, Triple Cross penetrates Mohamed's secret past and the dark reaches of Al Qaeda to reveal the danger that still threatens America and its internal security.",Hardcover,,604 pages,"

","Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Navy started a crash program, gathering information and educating personnel to deal with enemy bombs, land mines, and other explosive ordnance. Figuring ""lawyers make the best cannon fodder,"" recent law school graduate J. Frank Durham was among early volunteers for this dangerous and highly-classified work. Graduating with a perfect grade from the navy's new Bomb Disposal School, he was retained on staff to help the operation expand, then dispatched to Guadalcanal, where Americans were fighting the pivotal battle of World War Two. While learning how to handle explosive devices, Durham endured bombing, shelling, and an unexpected encounter with the enemy, but tales of suspense and danger are balanced by a humorous perspective on everyday life as an enlisted man. He describes ""unofficial"" enterprises, manufacturing souvenirs from brass shells in the captured Japanese ammo dump, and making moonshine from anything available, to sell to the troops. Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to the field hospital inspired a pithy comment about a painful loss from a wounded marine, and a classic riposte from the First Lady. Excerpts from captured Japanese diaries provide rare insight into the other side of the conflict.",Paperback,,156 pages,"

","Both Worlds at Once is a study of works of art conceived and produced late in their creators' careers. It pronounces an alternative to the mainstream life span creativity research which has, in general, adopted a decline perspective to the fruits of old age. Amir Cohen-Shalev argues that this age-decrement approach misses what the artists themselves tried to do in old age, which is often to develop a new form that allows them to thrive on ambivalence. Against the bleak predictions of developmental psychology and folk wisdom, this book focuses on old age as a unique stage of creative activity.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","In a theatre which self-consciously cultivated its audiences' imagination, how and what did playgoers ""see"" on the stage? This book reconstructs one aspect of that imaginative process. It considers a range of printed and documentary evidence, the majority previously unpublished, for the way ordinary individuals thought about their houses and households; and it then explores how writers of domestic tragedies engaged those attitudes to shape their representations of domesticity. It therefore offers a new method for understanding theatrical representations, based around a truly interdisciplinary study of the interaction between literary and historical methods. The plays cited include Arden of Faversham, Two Lamentable Tragedies, A Woman Killed With Kindness, and A Yorkshire Tragedy.",Hardcover,,352 pages,"

      Nine American Jewish Thinkers

","The nine American Jews of whom Milton Konvitz writes are philosophers, jurists, or rabbis, widely known and readily accepted as American Jewish thinkers. Their work reflects all essential Jewish values. Each person in his own way has dedicated his work to the betterment of life and the advancement of human ideals. In this sense, their Jewishness is not defined by religion alone. Americanism permeated all they thought and all they did.Konvitz argues that in the complex modern world, secularists often serve God more handsomely than do members of synagogues or churches. For example, when the Supreme Court in 1954 (with Felix Frankfurter playing a key role behind the scenes) agreed to outlaw segregation of the races in public schools, was the Court's action secular or religious? When Congress passed the statute known as the Americans with Disabilities Act, requiring equal treatment of handicapped persons, was the action secular or religious? Is a minimum wage act secular or religious? Is Medicaid a secular or a religious act? Konvitz believes the distinction is not useful, or even possible.The book is divided into three parts, reflecting Konvitz's range of intellectual interests. The nine essays offer concise intellectual biographies of three American Jewish philosophers, three Supreme Court Justices, and three rabbis. The philosophers-Horace M. Kallen, Morris Raphael Cohen, and Sidney Hook-are world-renowned. The jurists-Louis D. Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, and Felix Frankfurter-hold prominent places in American legal history. And the three rabbis-Leo Jung, Robert Gordis, and Jacob Agus-are known wherever Jewish thought is studied. By treating with equal seriousness the lives and writings of both religious and secularist thinkers, the author intentionally minimizes the conventional antagonism and frequent conflict between religion and secularism.An unusual feature of the book is the fact that the author was a close friend of six of the persons whose lives and work are examined, allowing him a perceptive insight into their character and thought. Although the book is about serious subjects, its graceful style makes the contents easily accessible to lay persons as well as scholars and students of Judaica.",Hardcover,,173 pages,"

","In this history Manuel ranges over the centuries, from antiquity to recent times, analyzing the diverse responses of European Christendom - Catholic, Protestant, and freethinking - to the culture and religious thought of the Judaism that survived, even thrived, in its midst. It is a history of marked contrasts. Though prolific in the outpouring of diatribes, European writers never agreed about Jewish thought and religion. should the worlds embodying Jewish beliefs be burned or ignored? Should they be consulted for what might be learned from them? Manuel shows the ""rediscovery"" of historical Judaism by Renaissance humanists alongside the vicious attacks mounted by Reformation leaders. He surveys the Christian Hebraists in the period that followed: clergymen, university professors, and gentlemen-scholars who studied Jewish religious thought and Hebrew to further Christian purposes. And he discusses the many ends - missionary, political, eschatological, Judeophobic - to which Christian thinkers turned their learning. In the 18th century the English deists and French ""philosophes"" - notably Voltaire - virulently attacked what they described as a primitive oriental religion. Manuel's picture of writers in 19th-century Germany encompasses the learned research, negative image-making, and polemics of the period.",Hardcover,,363 pages,"

","These essays begin with a dissection of the intifada at the end of 1987 and deal with people and events through 1994, when Israel began to withdraw from the disputed territories. Ineffective militarily, Edward Alexander notes, the intifada proved a potent propaganda tool: ""The spectacle of young Palestinian Arabs (at least in the early stages of the uprising, before the violence became highly organized) facing Israeli soldiers won for the Arabs precisely the victory they had sought: it swung liberal, including (if not especially) Jewish liberal, sympathy decisively to the side of the Arabs and against Israel.""Alexander’s book is the first to subject to withering criticism the ""body of ideas that lured Israel into the quagmire called the ‘peace process.’"" He excoriates prominent figures in politics, journalism, education, and literature who express hostility to, or open hatred of, Jews, Judaism, and Israel. Convinced that it is in the realm of ideas that the battle will be lost or won, Alexander has given special attention to ""some of the more brazen and flamboyant combatants in. . . the ‘Jewish wars’—Edward Said, Patrick Buchanan, the late George Ball, Alexander Cockburn, Michael Lerner, Noam Chomsky and still more to certain omnipresent personality types: the timorous Jew cloaking his timidity in the robes of the biblical prophet; the treacherous Jew presenting betrayal of his own people as ethical idealism; the ferocious antisemite parading as a dispassionate ‘critic of Israeli policies’; the journalist and publicist exploiting the full public-address and public-relations systems afforded by his profession while complaining that his voice is being ‘stifled’ by ‘the Jewish establishment.’""Recurring themes in Alexander’s essays are the relations between the Jews of America and those of Israel, the incorporation of anti-Zionism into the ideology of ""multiculturalism"" and the conventions of literary discussion, the politically motivated ""distortion and exploitation"" of the Holocaust, the strategies of moral and political discrimination used against Israel, the strategies employed by some prominent American and Israeli Jews to evade the implications of this discrimination, and the growing impunity with which antisemitism can be preached at both ends of the political spectrum.Alexander also reproduces some of the lively debate engendered by his essays in Commentary and Congress Monthly.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Making history from the moment of her birth, England's Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603) was a legend within her own lifetime. To her supporters, Elizabeth I was Gloriana, the Faerie Queene, a dignified and powerful woman who ruled with cunning and skill for forty-four years. To her detractors she was the ruthless supporter of a false religion; the murderer of her cousin Mary Queen of Scots; a wanton woman, herself illegitimate, who sullied the crown with her licentious behavior.    The legends that have grown up around Elizabeth are fascinating, but as this book shows, the truth is just as remarkable. In Elizabeth I: Ruler and Legend, Clark Hulse brings Elizabeth to life, combining text and images to tell her story through the objects handed down by history.   Commemorating the four hundredth anniversary of Elizabeth's death, this handsome volume contains over one hundred photographs of books, manuscripts, maps, letters, paintings, clothing, furniture, and many more artifacts dating from her reign. Each of these objects tells a story, and Hulse uses them as a starting point for a broad and thorough examination of Elizabeth and the society in which she lived.   Beginning with an analysis of the political events surrounding her birth, the book describes Elizabeth's relationship with her father, Henry VIII, and the maneuvering that led to her eventual coronation upon the death of her half-sister Mary Tudor in 1558.    As queen, Elizabeth oversaw a period of breathtaking cultural achievement. She kept England from being torn apart by the religious wars raging across Europe, and she withstood both an assassination plot and the massive military threat of the Spanish Armada. This book addresses all these major events, as well as a whole host of lesser-known aspects of Elizabeth's reign.   Hulse includes discussions of topics such as the education of Tudor women; markers of identity; portraits of Elizabeth; the queen's speaking style; her interest in America; music at the Tudor court; and literary depictions of Elizabeth by Shakespeare, Spenser, and other poets.  ",Paperback,,192 pages,"

The richness of late medieval art, philosophy, and history are powerfully brought to bear on one of Chaucer's most controversial works. So too are the insights of modern critical theory—semiotics, historicism, and gender studies especially—making this a unique achievement in medieval and Chaucerian studies.Delany's strikingly original readings of Chaucer's Orientalism, his sexual wordplay, his theological attitudes, and his treatment of sex and gender have given us a Chaucer for our time.",Hardcover,,259 pages,"

","Designed to fill a gap in Chaucerian studies, this book offers new insight into the development of Chaucer's artistry at a critical point in his career, after he had completed the Troilus and just before he embarked on The Canterbury Tales. Chaucer and ""The Legend of Good Women"" rejects the usual critical assessment of the Legend, setting it forth instead as a serious and experimental work,an important and necessary prelude to the achievement of The Canterbury Tales.Robert Worth Frank, Jr., begins his analysis of the Legend with a careful consideration of Chaucer's situation in1386, the year he presumably began the Legend. It was, he suggests, a moment in his career propitious for changechange in subject and in art as well. TheLegend reveals this change in the process of its accomplishment.Frank stresses that the road to The Canterbury Tales runs through the Legend.In tracing the route he shows how Chaucer broke away from the limited tradition of courtly love and experimented with a variety of tones and styles and an expanded range of subject matter, with a new verse form, the pentameter couplet, and with new techniques of compression which led to a greater dedication to the short narrative form. The individual legends, though not Chaucer's greatest creations, have merits of their own. The general uniformity of theme proves misleading. The legends provide Chaucer with a broader canvas than he had ever used before, making possible a wide variety in tone and dramatic incident.Above all, this study, enlivened by the author's supple and spirited prose, depicts Chaucer boldly committing himself to the great world of story and thereby drawing on some of the most enduring classical myths for material and moving toward a new art and a new and richer realm of human experience.",Hardcover,,233 pages,"

","In this masterful debut by a major new voice in fiction, Jon Clinch takes us on a journey into the history and heart of one of American literature’s most brutal and mysterious figures: Huckleberry Finn’s father. The result is a deeply original tour de force that springs from Twain’s classic novel but takes on a fully realized life of its own.Finn sets a tragic figure loose in a landscape at once familiar and mythic. It begins and ends with a lifeless body–flayed and stripped of all identifying marks–drifting down the Mississippi. The circumstances of the murder, and the secret of the victim’s identity, shape Finn’s story as they will shape his life and his death.Along the way Clinch introduces a cast of unforgettable characters: Finn’ s terrifying father, known only as the Judge; his sickly, sycophantic brother, Will; blind Bliss, a secretive moonshiner; the strong and quick-witted Mary, a stolen slave who becomes Finn’s mistress; and of course young Huck himself. In daring to re-create Huck for a new generation, Clinch gives us a living boy in all his human complexity–not an icon, not a myth, but a real child facing vast possibilities in a world alternately dangerous and bright.Finn is a novel about race; about paternity in its many guises; about the shame of a nation recapitulated by the shame of one absolutely unforgettable family. Above all, Finn reaches back into the darkest waters of America’s past to fashion something compelling, fearless, and new.",Hardcover,,287 pages,"

","Clark Ashton Smith could well be considered one of the great poets of the twentieth century, and much of his verse explores the realms of fantasy, terror, wonder, and the supernatural. In this volumethe first major selection of Smith's poetry in more than thirty yearseditors S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz have presented an extensive array of poetic work that fully reveals Smith's exotic language, imaginative range, and metrical precision. Including work from as early as the precocious Star-Treader and Other Poems (1912) and as late as the posthumously published The Hill of Dionysus (1962), The Last Oblivion features such celebrated works as ""Nero,"" ""Ode to the Abyss,"" and Smith's exquisite elegies to his mentor George Sterling and to his colleague in fantasy, H. P. Lovecraft. Poems on Zothique, Averoigne, and Atlantis, realms in which many of his prose tales are set, are also featured. More than two dozen unpublished or uncollected poems, never previously included in any of Smith's books, make The Last Oblivion a must for Smith devotees. Two full-color illustrations by Clark Ashton Smith and an exhaustive glossary of unusual words and names used in Smith's poetry enhance the volume.",Paperback,,200 pages,"

In the enchanted regions of Hyperborea, Atlantis and Xiccarph, encounter malefic magic and demonic deeds beneath the last rays of a fading sun . . . For the first time ever, this volume encompasses Clark Ashton Smith's entire career as a writer. Smith virtually stopped writing stories in 1937, for reasons that have never been satisfactorily explained, but he left behind a unique legacy of fantasy fiction which is as imaginative and decadent today as when it was first published in the pulp magazines more than half a century ago.",Paperback,Fantasy Masterworks #26,592 pages,"

","In 1911 the poet George Sterling was the focus of a thriving literary community in California that included Jack London, Mary Austin, and the aged Ambrose Bierce. When he received a letter and some manuscript poems from a young writer in Auburn named Clark Ashton Smith, he immediately recognized that a literary prodigy of tremendous potential had come his way, and for the remaining fifteen years of his life he nurtured Smith's poetic talent with care and sensitivity. This volume presents, for the first time, the complete surviving correspondence between these two poetic titans. In the decade and a half of their involvement, they exchanged many poems and prose works, visited each other on several occasions, and discussed the burning literary and social issues of the day--Modernist poetry, the founding of Weird Tales,  the publication of their collections of cosmic and fantastic verse, and much else besides. Such figures as H. L. Mencken, H. P. Lovecraft, and Donald Wandrei are the subjects of their frequent letters, and we come to see why Smith took over the mantle of poetic greatness from Sterling, whose suicide in 1926 left Smith shocked and bereft. As an appendix, all of Smith's essays on Sterling, and Sterling's writings on Smith, are gathered.This volume has been scrupulously annotated by David E. Schultz and S. T. Joshi, leading authorities on Smith, Sterling, Lovecraft, Bierce, and other writers.",Paperback,,344 pages,"

Back in print for the first time since 1971, Lost Worlds brings together twenty-three of Smith's classic stories, all of which were originally published in Weird Tales. Rather than center his works on heroes, Smith created fantastical worlds around which he built cycles of stories. Included here are tales from the realms of Averoigne, Zothique, Hyperborea, and others. Told in lush poetic prose, these haunting stories bring to life dark, dreamlike realms full of gothic monsters and mortals.

","In 1927, H.P. Lovecraft wrote about Clark Ashton Smith: ""In sheer daemonic strangeness and fertility of conception, Mr. Smith is perhaps unexcelled by any other writer dead or living. Who else has seen such gorgeous, luxuriant, and feverishly distorted visions of infinite spheres and multiple dimensions and lived to tell the tale?"" If you relish horror or dark fantasy, and you have yet to discover Klarkash-Ton, you have a real treat in store. This beautifully produced Arkham House collection is a bejeweled corridor into the dark worlds of vampire-cursed Averoigne, Zothique of the dying sun, primordial Hyperborea (which, with its black, amorphous god Tsathoggua, is close in spirit to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos), and others. Smith is a consummate stylist whose evocations of lush exoticism and languid evil led critic Brian Stableford to call him ""the poet of American Decadence,"" and yet his tales are also humorous—in a wry, macabre way. A Rendezvous in Averoigne collects 30 tales, with illustrations by J.K. Potter and an introduction by Ray Bradbury.Contents:Introduction (A Rendezvous in Averoigne) • essay by Ray BradburyA Rendezvous in Averoigne • interior artwork by J.K.

","According to popular definition, prophets accurately predict the future. In Jewish tradition, as Abraham Joshua Heschel explains in The Prophets, they earn the title by witnessing the world around them with outstanding passion. Prophets are those whose ""life & soul are at stake"" in what they say about ""the mystery of [God's] relation to man."" They're ""some of the most disturbing people who have ever lived."" Yet they're also ""the men whose image is our refuge in distress & whose voice & vision sustain our faith."" This book, a classic text on the subject, contains sophisticated, straightforward discussions of each of the Hebrew prophets, the primary themes of their preaching & comparisons of Israel's prophets to those of other religions'. Throughout, he avoids the two great temptations in any discussion of prophesy: overstating the supernatural quality of a prophet's epiphany (""A prophet is a person, not a microphone"") & reducing prophesy to a merely human phenomenon. Instead, he describes the prophet's peculiar status as God's spokesman in a way that does justice to its complexity: ""He speaks from the perspective of God as perceived from the perspective of his own situation.""--Michael Joseph Gross (edited)",Hardcover,,522 pages,"

","In his lifetime, the late Abraham Joshua Heschel was celebrated as a profound religious thinker, an eloquent writer on Hasidism, a modern prophet who led civil rights marches. All of these eclipsed his reputation as a first-rate scholar of Jewish thought; since his death his work has gradually emerged from behind his fame. Central among his interests was the nature of the direct experience of God, either mystically or prophetically. While his work on the ancient Israelite prophets is well known, his studies of prophetic inspiration among Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages is not, in part because it exists in article form and in part because these articles were written in Hebrew. The standard Jewish view is that prophecy ended with the ancient prophets, somewhere early in the Second Temple era. Heschel demonstrated that this view is not altogether accurate. Belief in the possibility of continued prophetic inspiration, and in its actual occurrence - appear throughout much of the medieval period, and even in modern times.",Hardcover,,157 pages,"

","""Bible"" as used in the title of this book refers to the Bibles used by mainstream American Jews, Roman Catholics and Protestants. This book deals with the books of the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, including those of the Apocrypha. This is a study of the people who wrote the books of the Bible and of the historical, political and social settings in which they wrote and of the factors that caused the authors to write. The search for the authors and what motivated them to write takes the readers into the origins of the stories that make up a large part of the Bible. While many popular and scholarly books have been written about the authorship of specific books of the Bible, this is the only book known to the author that deals with all of the books of the Bible in less than several volumes. It is in laymen's language with footnotes suggesting where readers can find further information for expanded study. Where scholars have offered differing views of biblical matters that affect the determination of authorship, this book presents the various views - in laymen's language. Because many of the authors of the books of the Bible wrote in response to the social and political situations in which they lived, this book looks into those situations. For example: The exile of the Hebrews of Judah to Babylon set the stage for the collection and editing of what became the first books of the Old Testament. The person or team who did that work did so as preparation for taking ""the law"" back to Judah and Jerusalem. In a not-too-dissimilar fashion, the political and social climate of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries A.D. caused Christians to gather and worship in secret, isolated groups. That led to the development of aberrant local doctrines, such as Gnosticism. That in turn contributed to the flow of correspondence between Christians. Some of that correspondence became or contributed to the books of the New Testament. Another example: When Emperor Constantine made Christianity the official religion of Rome in A.D. 318, the previously hidden schisms came to the surface. That led to the Council of Nicea and the debate between Arius and Athanasius about the nature of Jesus and to the writing of the Nicene Creed stating belief in Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Those events helped to set the tone for at least some of the books of the New Testament. It is all there in laymen's language. Read, learn and enjoy! C. Jack Trickler",Hardcover,,372 pages,"

","In this book, Bino takes the words of both Testaments beyond the religious significance of holy and beyond the religious doctrines and dogmas, which arose from the Bible's varied interpretations. Against a historical background, particularly where it relates to Christianity, he questions and places the Passion of the Christ in doubt Bino emphasises the need to liberate not only the biblical writings, but also - and particularly so - the interpretations of these writings by different religious sects, from the label of holiness. Bino shows the need to question and query what has been taken, as being religiously accepted truths for two millennia. He places a question mark in the reality of the Old Testament (Genesis in particular), and in the veracity of the gospels, and in the inspiration of the Gospels writers. His research into the churches' varied religious doctrines takes him beyond the restrictions imposed by each religion, within one's own religious background (whichever religion). Underlying the above, Bino confesses his beliefs in spirituality and his faith in the Heavenly Father. He also emphasises the need to be on the guard against unwanted and undesirable influences, which go against two basic core principles: thou shalt not kill and do unto others. He takes these principles one step further and brings them into the reality of today's environment of the family life, and into the management of corporations and organisational behaviour. The first part of Bino's book is a summary of spiritual principles which he believes were Jesus true teachings. It is in this part of the book that he addresses the concepts of reincarnation and freewill, and the existence of Good and Evil. Inthe second part of the book, Bino analyses the Book of Genesis and relates the impact that the biblical interpretations thereof have had on shaping Christianity's path. It is here that he liberates mankind from the Christian insistence that man was born in sin; and he also liberates the world, from the biblical eschatology, and God from what they say God said and did. In the third part of the book, Bino assesses the impact that the interpretations of the Gospels have exerted on mankind's free spiritual growth and development. He considers the Gospels, their writers and the early Church Fathers, and their possible motivations in the establishment of basic Christian doctrines. These, he believes are the result of three fundamental Christian principles (the heel of Achilles): that man was born in sin; that repentance for the sins committed means forgiveness; and that salvation is conditional, upon acceptance of the Paschal Lamb. In this chapter, he evaluates the Gospel narratives concerning Jesus birth, His betrayal, arrest, condemnation, crucifixion, death, burial, resurrection and ascension, and he also questions the pertinent Christian prophecies (as quoted), as being applicable to any of these stages of Jesus' life. It is in the last part of his book that Bino clarifies the Christian principles, within his spiritual beliefs and faith. It is also here where Bino addresses the occult, such as possessions and evil controls; as well as sin, day of judgement, forgiveness for sins committed, pity, compassion, love, marriage, divorce, and companionship, amongst other principles.",Paperback,,464 pages,"

","The narrator of The Bottoms is Harry Collins, an old man obsessively reflecting on certain key experiences of his childhood. In 1933, the year that forms the centerpiece of the narrative, Harry is 11 years old and living with his mother, father, and younger sister on a farm outside of Marvel Creek, Texas, near the Sabine River bottoms. Harry's world changes forever when he discovers the corpse of a young black woman tied to a tree in the forest near his home. The woman, who is eventually identified as a local prostitute, has been murdered, molested, and sexually mutilated. She is also, as Harry will soon discover, the first in a series of similar corpses, all of them the victims of a new, unprecedented sort of monster: a traveling serial killer.From his privileged position as the son of constable (and farmer and part-time barber) Jacob Collins, Harry watches as the distinctly amateur investigation unfolds. As more bodies -- not all of them ""colored"" -- surface, the mood of the local residents darkens. Racial tensions -- never far from the surface, even in the best of times -- gradually kindle. When circumstantial evidence implicates an ancient, innocent black man named Mose, the Ku Klux Klan mobilizes, initiating a chilling, graphically described lynching that will occupy a permanent place in Harry Collins's memories. With Mose dead and the threat to local white women presumably put to rest, the residents of Marvel Creek resume their normal lives, only to find that the actual killer remains at large and continues to threaten the safety and stability of the town.Lansdale uses this protracted murder investigation to open up a window on an insular, poverty-stricken, racially divided community. With humor, precision, and great narrative economy, he evokes the society of Marvel Creek in all its alternating tawdriness and nobility, offering us a varied, absolutely convincing portrait of a world that has receded into history. At the same time, he offers us a richly detailed re-creation of the vibrant, dangerous physical landscapes that were part of that world and have since been buried under the concrete and cement of the industrialized juggernaut of the late 20th century. In Lansdale's hands, the gritty realities of Depression-era Texas are as authentic -- and memorable -- as anything in recent American fiction.",Paperback,,328 pages,"

","The man widely believed to have been the model for Alden Pyle in Graham Greene's The Quiet American, Edward G. Lansdale (1908--1987) was a Cold War celebrity. A former advertising executive turned undercover CIA agent, he was credited during the 1950s with almost single-handedly preventing a communist takeover of the Philippines and with helping to install Ngo Dinh Diem as president of the American-backed government of South Vietnam. Adding to his notoriety, during the Kennedy administration Lansdale was put in charge of Operation Mongoose, the covert plot to overthrow the government of Cuba's Fidel Castro by assassination or other means.In this book, Jonathan Nashel reexamines Lansdale's role as an agent of American Cold War foreign policy and takes into account both his actual activities and the myths that grew to surround him. In contrast to previous portraits, which tend to depict Lansdale either as the incarnation of U.S. imperialist ambitions or as a farsighted patriot dedicated to the spread of democracy abroad, Nashel offers a more complex and nuanced interpretation. At times we see Lansdale as the arrogant ""ugly American,"" full of confidence that he has every right to make the world in his own image and utterly blind to his own cultural condescension. This is the Lansdale who would use any conceivable gimmick to serve U.S. aims, from rigging elections to sugaring communist gas tanks. Elsewhere, however, he seems genuinely respectful of the cultures he encounters, open to differences and new possibilities, and willing to tailor American interests to Third World needs.Rather than attempting to reconcile these apparently contradictory images of Lansdale, Nashel explores the ways in which they reflected a broader tension within the culture of Cold War America. The result is less a conventional biography than an analysis of the world in which Lansdale operated and the particular historical forces that shaped him -- from the imperatives of anticommunist ideology and the assumptions of modernization theory to the techniques of advertising and the insights of anthropology.",Paperback,,278 pages,"

","Lawgiver and liberator. Seer and prophet. The only human permitted to converse with God ""face-to-face."" Moses is the most commanding presence in the Old Testament. Yet as Jonathan Kirsch shows in this brilliant, stunningly original volume, Moses was also an enigmatic and mysterious figure--at once a good shepherd and a ruthless warrior, a spiritual leader and a magician, a lawgiver who broke his own laws, God's chosen friend and hounded victim. Now, in Moses: A Life, Kirsch accomplishes the wondrous feat of revealing the real Moses, a strikingly modern figure who steps out from behind the facade of Sunday school lessons and movie matinees.Drawing on the biblical text and a treasury of both scholarship and storytelling, Kirsch examines all that is known and all that has been imagined of Moses. In these vivid pages, we see the marvels and mysteries of Moses's life in a new light--his rescue in infancy and adoption by an Egyptian princess; his reluctant assumption of the role of liberator; his struggles to wrest his people from the pharaoh's dominion; his desperate vigil on Mount Sinai. Here too is the darker, more ominous Moses--the sorcerer, the husband of a pagan woman, the military commander who cold-bloodedly ordered the slaying of innocent people; the beloved of God whom God sought twice to murder.Jonathan Kirsch brings both prodigious knowledge and a keen imagination to one of the most compelling stories of the Bible, and the results are fascinating. A figure of mystery, passion, and contradiction, Moses emerges from this book very much a hero for our time.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,448 pages,"

","St. Gregory of Nyssa This great spiritual master of the fourth century was born as the general persecution of Christians was ending. One of the Greek Cappadocian Fathers (the other two were Gregory's brother, St. Basil the Great, and their mutual friend, St. Gregory Nazianzen), Gregory has come to be regarded increasingly as the most brilliant and subtle thinker and most profound mystical teacher of the three. Whether or not one agrees with Jean Danielou who saw Gregory as the founder of mystical importance within the Christian tradition.The Life of Moses has special significance because it reflects Gregory's spiritual sense of the Scriptures. He maintained that the ultimate purpose of the Bible was not its historical teachings but its capacity for elevating the soul to God. Gregory saw the totality of the spiritual life as an epektasis, a continual growth or straining ahead, as in the words of St. Paul, Forgetting the past, I strain for what is still to come. Gregory frames an immensely significant synthesis of the earlier Hellenistic and Jewish traditions in this work. He describes the spiritual ascent as taking place in three stages, symbolized by the Lord's revelation of Himself to Moses, first in light, then in the cloud and, finally, in the dark. This translation and introduction, winner of the Christian Research Foundation Award, has been expertly rendered by Professors Abraham Malherbe of Yale University and Everett Ferguson of Abilene Christian University.",Paperback,,208 pages,"

","Moses is probably the most important figure in the Old Testament of the Bible. Born into a Hebrew family, he was rescued from a cruel death and raised in the court of the Pharaoh. But after killing an Egyptian, he fled into the desert. Many years later, God appeared to him in the form of a burning bush. He ordered Moses to go back to Egypt and lead the Hebrews out of bondage and into the Promised Land. It wasn't easy. The Hebrews spent many years wandering in the desert, during which time Moses received the Ten Commandmentstwice. He smashed the stone tablets on which they were inscribed the first time because the Hebrews had begun worshiping a golden calf during his absence. Despite all the difficulties and the dangers, Moses' determined leadership finally brought his people to the Promised Land. But he died before he could accompany his fellow Hebrews into their new home.",Library Binding,,48 pages,"

","This collection of Joe R. Lansdale stories represents the best of the “Lansdale” genre—a strange mixture of dark crime, even darker humor, and adventure tales. The stories are varied in setting and theme, but they are all pure Lansdale—eerie, amusing, and occasionally horrific. In “The Pit,” modern gladiators square off against one another using Roman methods. An alternate-history tale called “Trains Not Taken” shows Buffalo Bill as an ambassador and Wild Bill Hickok as a clerk. Lansdale’s love of large lizards and humor are evident in the stories “Godzilla’s Twelve Step Program” and “Bob the Dinosaur Goes to Disneyland.”",Paperback,,267 pages,"

","The endlessly inventive mind of Joe R. Lansdale whips up yet another batch of stories to amaze, surprise, and entertain you.His new offering covers a lot of territory, producing what may be his best short story collection yet.One tale concerns an East Texas mule race in the early 1900s that proves to be an unexpected turning point and learning experience for the main character, a lifelong loser. It also chronicles the unusual circumstances of the race, which include a friendship between a rare white mule that can run like the wind, and his friend, a loyal, spotted pig.Another tale drops us into the disturbed mind of a mass murderer and his friendship with the shadows.Two others stories reintroduce us to the supernatural adventures of Reverend Rains, the flawed hero from Lansdale's cult favorite novel, Dead in the West. Here ghouls prowl and werewolves howl.There's a poetic collaboration with Melissa Mia Hall about the nature of loneliness and loss that echoes back to science fiction stories of an earlier time, as well as a famous, award winning novella reprinted here for the first time in several years about a clutch of unusual crime solvers.Read about a world where the dead almost rule, and venture into an alternate universe that is the background for perhaps the strangest tale of all, an adventure concerning an earnest and horny steam shovel named Bill, and his challenge to do the right thing at all costs.It's the usual wild and crowd pleasing display of what has become a subgenre of modern literature as only Joe R. Lansdale can present it: Tales Lansdalien.Welcome to his world.",Hardcover,Signed Trade Edition,287 pages,"

","Robert McGee is a man living under a dark cloud. Acclaimed cartoonist of the underground comic book Birdland, he has moved his family from Texas to New Orleans and finally to Missing Mile, North Carolina. But Robert is unable to escape the drinking and the violence that have become as natural to him as breathing. Soon after he and his family settle into a decrepit farmhouse, Robert kills his wife, his younger son, and then himself. Only his five-year-old son, Trevor, is left alive. Twenty years later Trevor McGee, also a cartoonist, returns to Missing Mile to the house in which his family once lived. He has been running from the truth for years, and finally realizes he must face his demons. He fears that what happened to his father will happen to him. But if it does, Trevor thinks, at least I won't have anyone to kill. Then he befriends Zachary Bosch, a computer hacker from New Orleans running from the law. In the house, which Trevor calls Birdland, they must confront much more than bad memories. For the house itself carries its own dark force, which threatens to envelop Trevor in the past and destroy him. Stephen King's The Shining re-created the haunted house novel in the '70s with a stunning vision; Brite combines these elements in a totally new way to reimagine this genre for the '90s with a brilliant new power.",Hardcover,,373 pages,"

When Rickey concocts the idea of opening a restaurant in their alcohol-loving hometown where every dish packs a spirited punch, they know they're on their way to the bank. With some wheeling and dealing, a slew of great recipes, and a few lucky breaks, Rickey and G-man are soon on their way to opening Liquor, their very own restaurant. But first they need to pacify a local crank who doesn't want to see his neighborhood disturbed, sidestep Rickey's deranged ex-boss, rein in their big-mouth silent partner before he runs amok, and stay afloat in a stew of corruption in a town well known for its bottom feeders.A manic, spicy romp through the kitchens, back alleys, dive bars, and drug deals of the country's most sublimely ridiculous city, author Poppy Z.

","""The Troubles"" in Northern Ireland have proved to be one of the most intractable conflicts in Europe since the Second World War, consistently attracting international attention, particularly from the United States. This highly readable exploration of the central issues and debates about Northern Ireland sets them in the historical context of hundreds of years of conflict. It introduces all the key figures and organizations involved in current violent and political conflicts and tackles many questions, such as: What accounts for the perpetuation of ethnic and religious conflict in Ireland? Why has armed violence proven so hard to control? Who are the major figures and issues in the conflict? Can we expect more ""Northern Irelands"" in the future? A concise, reliable introduction to the historical and current situation, this book is ideal reading for anyone wanting to know more about the political climate of Northern Ireland.",Paperback,,209 pages,"

","The body of a well-liked local historian is found half-buried under a drystone wall near the village of Helmthorpe, Swainsdale. Who on earth would want to kill such a thoughtful, dedicated man? Penny Cartwright, a beautiful folk singer with a mysterious past, a shady land-developer, Harry's editor and a local thriller writer are all suspects - and all are figures from Harry's previous, idyllic summers in the dale. A young girl, Sally Lumb, knows more than she lets on, and her knowledge could lead to danger. Inspector Banks' second case unearths disturbing secrets behind a bucolic facade. ""The novels of Peter Robinson are chilling, evocative, deeply nuanced worksof art."" - Dennis Lehane. ""If you haven't encountered Chief Inspector Alan Banks before, prepare for a crash course in taut, clean writing and subtle psychology. And watch for those twists - they'll get you every time."" - Ian Rankin.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Through the lens of American Lutheranism, this book offers a unique examination into the intersection of religion, war, foreign policy, church politics, and nationalism during the contentious 1960s and 1970s. It contributes a two-pronged investigation of American history during the Vietnam War era. First, it outlines how this diverse group of Christians understood foreign policy and the churches' relationship to it. Lutherans offer a broad spectrum of religious, political, and diplomatic points of view because they never have represented a homogenous or unified group in U.S. history. Second, this investigation provides the perspective of one cross section of Americans who often remain hidden from historic memory: the silent majority as so labeled during the Richard M. Nixon administration. Most Lutherans held 'moderate' religious and political ideologies, but Lutherans also had representatives from the far left and far right. Lutherans also signify the Cold War context of this decade with a relatively uniform hostility toward the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Yet, simultaneously they vigorously debated whether or not Communists had infiltrated U.S. institutions and contentiously disagreed about the Vietnam War. Further reflecting America at that time, by the mid-1970s they had reached a tentative reconciliation with one another because the infighting had so tired them. In doing so, they healed some of the wounds created by a decade of conflict but failed to learn lessons from the experience because they refused to dialogue further about it.",Hardcover,,221 pages,"

","In his classic story ""The Call of Cthulhu"" H.P. Lovecraft wrote: ""The cult would never die till the stars came right again, and the secret priests would take great Cthulhu from His tomb to revive His subjects and resume His rule of earth. The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.""Lovecraft was right, though he only glimpsed a tiny sliver of the true horror that governs the secret history of the world. The truth is much, much worse as several young people are about to discover. The miracle drug ""Essence"" opens doors of perception hitherto undreamed of, but there's a heavy price to paid. The price is to belong body and soul to nameless horrors that were old when the earth was young. Nobody rides for free, and damn few get out alive…",Hardcover,,148 pages,"

Haunted Hills and Hanging Valleys presents for the first time the best work of a writing career that has drawn Trower praise as ""the poet laureate of this mountain kingdom"" from Al Purdy and for ""heft and passion and a gift for telling place and detail"" from Irving Layton.

","With his father killed in the battle of Shiloh and four younger children still at home to support, and too young by one year to join the Union Army, fourteen-year-old Gideon Tell becomes apprentice photographer to fast-talking, clever and well-read Charles Rintree. Rintree is headed to infiltrate enemy lines at Vicksburg, to take photographs of positions and armaments, reckoning to get them to General Grant, not for outright cash, but for the fame and subsequent money that fame will bring. Vicksburg has been blocking Union supply lines in the Mississippi. Aboard Empress, Grant's supply steamer, Gideon and Rintree are caught between a double line of fire. The captain has taken civilian passengers aboard against the arguments of Union troop commander Lieutenant Stephen Kane. With the steamer under attack, Rintree and Gideon bravely remain on deck taking pictures of the shore battlements. Later, seeing the photographs and realizing that photographic surveillance is the way of the future, Kane conspires with Rintree to place him and Gideon inside the city of Vicksburg-their cover story to be that they are refugees desiring to return to the South; Rintree a surgeon, and Gideon his son with an interest in the new science of photography chronicling his father's work. The Millers, newspaper owners with Union sympathies, will be their contacts. Rintree quickly becomes a surprisingly good fulltime civilian surgeon. Vicksburg's society loves him. Gideon realizes that it is up to him to take the pictures. Under the guise of a newspaper photographer creating an image of Vicksburg for Miller's newspaper, Gideon may go almost anywhere and photograph freely on assignment. His objective is thepanoramic view from atop the courthouse. Slowly, Gideon reassesses Rintree as a liar, forger and perhaps wheeler-dealer angling to sell the photographs to the highest bidder. When Kane arrives incognito (switching identity with a recently dead war correspondent and doing a fine impression of him) they share their suspicions of Rintree being a double spy. It becomes imperative to get Gideon and his prints to General Grant. A prisoner/troop train out of Vicksburg is the answer. What follows is a thrilling, action-packed no-holds barred, identities revealing great train escape. The novel is seasoned with humor, seeds of romance, masked identities and great insight into character development and relationships. A bonus is actual photographs of Vicksburg and historical personages who are woven into the story.",Paperback,,190 pages,"

","Wednesday's Child is the 1997 winner of the Maine Chapbook Award. It is in its third printing. It is taught at universities throughout New England. Introduction in the book: This is a book about a female growing up, living in, trying to leave her cultural self behind, and then returning to the Franco-American cultural group which exists in the Northeast, and more specifically in Waterville, Maine. The book addresses what has been asked of me in order to be present to this cultural group of people. As a girl/woman who or how have I been asked to be? What has been asked of me? The book is written from the perspective of a contemporary woman who is also an historical person. The book is also as much about the conditions in which the Franco-American group exists as well as the writing about what it means to be Franco-American and female. This is a book about how we are our historical self while we are in the present. I am more of my past--than I am of the present moment--when it is in the present moment that I now exist. What is, or is not, reflected in my reality and the reality of other Franco-Americans? This book is about the female self and her formation through the many individuals and institutions around her. Through story and cultural filters, the book illustrates family, friends, religion, health, alcoholism, superstitions, art & craft, beliefs, values, song, recipe, story, coming-of-age, generations, motherhood, language, bilingualism, denials, sexuality and what constitutes a cultural individual in a society that will not always allow that person full access or realization to who she is. But she does it anyway.",Paperback,,89 pages,"

She left behind her faithless husband to begin a new life with her young son Jeremy-as a family doctor in a small northern California town.  But Hartwood held a bitter welcome. Leigh's first patient, a child, died mysteriously in her office. And soon Leigh was too busy to spend much time with Jeremy. It seemed her only friend was Nora-the woman who took such good care of the town's little children.

","A sequel to Howard Sachar's classic History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time, which Commentary called ""monumental...a triumph of comprehensive scholarship which is also a delight to read,"" this book offers an equally compelling and powerful narrative and a wealth of human detail. The second volume begins where its predecessor left off, tracing the political, social, and economic growth of the Israeli republic from the traumatic aftermath of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 through the Begin and Peres eras. With lucidity and incisiveness, Sachar presents the fascinating saga of the ethnic ""revolution"" that brought Menachem Begin to power; the social upheavals that have shaken the Arab population of the West Bank; the growth of Palestinian terrorism and of incipient Jewish vigilantism; and the clandestine dialogue between Israel's and Lebanon's political leaders that culminated in Ariel Sharon's ill-starred 1982 military invasion. Since the Yom Kippur War, Israel's history has consisted of stark contrasts between dramatic military strikes abroad--Entebbe, Baghdad, Tunis among them--and confusion and violent confrontation at home over such issues as the settlement of the occupied Arab territories and religious extremism. Covering all the dramatic milestones since the mid-seventies, Sachar explores Israel's current malaise and the extent to which the fate of the Jewish nation rests on the foreign and economic strategies of the Great Powers. Both a compelling story and a penetrating analysis of Israel's current difficulties and achievements, this volume stands as a brilliant successor to a book critics and scholars have recognized as the definitive work in the field.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","""A remarkable feat--clear, compelling and accessible--. Critical background for any appreciation of the Jewish state.""--The New York Times Book ReviewWith his characteristic grace and lucidity, Howard M. Sachar, renowned author of thirteen earlier books on Middle Eastern and Jewish history, brings to life the complex and dramatic story of the friendships and fallings-out between Israel and the various European powers over the last half-century.Dr. Sachar chronicles the always uneasy relationship between Israel and Great Britain; its early love-affair and nasty break-up with France; the shifting Soviet policies toward Israel; and the unlikely emergence of Germany as the new nation's chief European benefactor. A master of historical narrative, Sachar once again enlightens us with fine scholarship, insightful analysis, and an unerring knowledge of human--and national--motivations.",Paperback,,416 pages,"

","A devastating account of contemporary Russia by a great and brave writer.A Russian Diary is the book that Anna Politkovskaya had recently completed when she was murdered in a contract killing in Moscow. It covers the period from the Russian elections of December 2003 to the tragic aftermath of the Beslan school siege in late 2005. The book is an unflinching record of the plight of millions of Russians and a pitiless report on the cynicism and corruption of Vladimir Putin’s presidency.She interviews people whose lives have been devastated by Putin’s policies, including the mothers of children who died in the Beslan siege, those of Russian soldiers maimed in Chechnya then abandoned by the State, and of “disappeared” young men and women. Elsewhere she meets traumatized and dangerous veterans of the Chechen wars, and a notorious Chechen warlord in his fortified lair.Putin is re-elected as President in farcically undemocratic circumstances and yet Western leaders, reliant on Russia’s oil and gas reserves, continue to pay him homage. Politkovskaya offers a chilling account of his dismantling of the democratic reforms made in the 1990s. She also criticizes the inability of liberals and democrats to provide a united, effective opposition and a population slow to protest against government legislative outrages.A Russian Diary is clear-sighted, passionate and marked with the humanity that made Anna Politkovskaya known to many as “Russia’s lost moral conscience” and a heroine to readers throughout the world.",Paperback,,323 pages,"

","When last seen alive, sixteen-year-old Deborah Harrison was on her way home from school. Her friend Megan thinks she saw the shadowy figure of a man behind Deborah as they waved goodbye on the bridge, but the fog was so thick that evening she can’t be sure. Not long after, Deborah’s body is found in the local cemetery. The murder terrorises the wealthy enclave of St Mary’s, Eastvale, and because Deborah was the daughter of a prominent industrialist, high-flying new Chief Constable Jeremiah “Jimmy” Riddle puts pressure on Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his team to catch the killer without delay. And soon, partly thanks to the work of new boy Detective Inspector Barry Stott, it looks as if they have done…But Banks is not convinced. While the community breathes a collective sigh of relief and turns into a lynch-mob, Banks examines the loose ends: a vicar, accused of sexually harassing a refugee worker, who lies about his whereabouts at the time of the murder; his straying wife; a schoolteacher with a dark secret; the accused’s vindictive ex-girlfriend; a teenage thug who has threatened Deborah and her family with violence. And then there are Deborah’s own family secrets. With each new piece of information, a different pattern is formed, until Banks is forced to incur the wrath of Jimmy Riddle if he hopes to solve the case.",Paperback,,400 pages,"

Her friend Megan thinks she saw the shadowy figure of a man behind Deborah as they waved goodbye on the bridge, but the fog was so thick that evening she can’t be sure. Not long after, Deborah’s body is found in the local cemetery. The murder terrorises the wealthy enclave of St Mary’s, Eastvale, and because Deborah was the daughter of a prominent industrialist, high-flying new Chief Constable Jeremiah “Jimmy” Riddle puts pressure on Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his team to catch the killer without delay. And soon, partly thanks to the work of new boy Detective Inspector Barry Stott, it looks as if they have done…But Banks is not convinced. While the community breathes a collective sigh of relief and turns into a lynch-mob, Banks examines the loose ends: a vicar, accused of sexually harassing a refugee worker, who lies about his whereabouts at the time of the murder; his straying wife; a schoolteacher with a dark secret; the accused’s vindictive ex-girlfriend; a teenage thug who has threatened Deborah and her family with violence. And then there are Deborah’s own family secrets. With each new piece of information, a different pattern is formed, until Banks is forced to incur the wrath of Jimmy Riddle if he hopes to solve the case.",Paperback,,400 pages,"

","The eighth novel in the critically acclaimed Inspector Alan Banks series. Detective Inspector Banks had seen crimes just as savage in London, but somehow the murder of a teenage girl seemed all the more shocking in the quiet Yorkshire village of Eastvale. Deborah Harrison had been found one foggy night in the churchyard behind St Mary's, strangled with the strap of her school satchel. But Deborah was no typical sixteen-year-old. Her father was a powerful financier who ran in the highest echelons of industry, defence and classified information. And Deborah, it seemed, enjoyed keeping secrets of her own...",Paperback,,444 pages,"

But Joshua Walker had worked these mountains and streams most of his adult life and preferred it to what was becoming the new progressive way of living. With winter coming on soon he knew the much-feared Arikara Indians would be making way to their wintering camps, so he skirted their country in search of a place to set his traps and settle in for the winter himself. Just as he began his travels, he encountered something that bewildered him and upon closer inspection he bore witness to a grizzly scene that would alter his destiny forever.",Paperback,,245 pages,"

","""Allah has bought from the Umma-the true believers of Islam-their selves and their substance in return for Paradise; they fight in the way of Allah, killing and being killed. Their promise is written in the blood of the moon."" -From the Koran, chap. 9, v. 112 The conflict between Islam and the West existed long before the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other events that recently touched America. It goes back hundreds, even thousands, of years. Yet the struggle is upon us now as never before. In this well-reasoned, accessible book, Middle East expert George Grant answers the troubling questions on many believers' minds. Who are the followers of Islam, and what do they believe? What could have motivated those who carried out the acts of terror on September 11? Why has there been tension between Islam and the West for centuries? What are the true meanings of terms such as Ji'had, Intifada, and Dhimma? And is there any hope for peace? The call upon believers now-as always-is to prepare and equip ourselves so that we may stand fast. The Blood of the Moon will help readers better understand the history of Islam and its struggle with the Western world, as well as how Christians can share the message of salvation through Jesus Christ with the followers of Allah.",Paperback,,134 pages,"

","""THE FIRST FULL ACCOUNT OF THE CAPTURE OF ADOLF EICHMANN, TOLD BY THE FORMER HEAD OF ISRAEL'S SECRET SERVICE.""""I have to announce in the Knesset that a short time ago one of the greatest Nazi criminals was found by the Israeli Security Services: Adolf Eichmann, who was responsible, together with the Nazi leaders, for what they called the 'Final Solution of the Jewish Problem'—that is, the extermination of six million Jews of Europe. ""Adolf Eichmann is already under arrest in Israel, and he will shortly be brought to trial in Israel under the Nazis and Nazi Collaborators [Punishment] Law of 1950.""On May 23, 1960, Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion electrified the world with this simple pronouncement. Yet even in the ensuing drama of Eichmann's trial with its attendant worldwide publicity, some vitally important questions remained unanswered: How had the Israelis ""found"" this former Nazi leader, who had vanished so completely that many people presumed him dead? Who was involved in the successful capture of a man who had vowed to commit suicide if he was ever apprehended? How had they accomplished their mission? For fifteen years the true story behind the spectacular headlines remained shrouded in secrecy. Now the official silence is broken: Isser Harel, the man who directed every step of Operation Eichmann, reveals a complete account of that historic manhunt and arrest. Each development in the quest for justice is meticulously reconstructed, from the first tentative identification of Eichmann (made by a blind man) to the final nerve-searing flight from Buenos Aires to Israel.Surely no work of fiction could be more abundant in suspenseful detail or baffling plot twists.... The ""heroes"" of Operation Eichmann, however, bear little resemblance to their fictional counter-parts. They are touchingly human, so vulnerable to fear, despair, and, ultimately, exultation, that the story of their idealistic struggle is more absorbing and moving than that of any imaginary superspy. In 1945 Adolf Eichmann boasted, ""I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have 5,000,000 human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction."" Fifteen years later he stood in a courtroom in Jerusalem, brought to justice by some of the very people who had so narrowly avoided adding to his satisfaction. The House on Garibaldi Street is a complete record of that extraordinary mission and an inspiring portrait of the men and women who accomplished it. Isser Harel served as Chief Executive of the Secret Services of Israel from 1952 to 1963, supervising internal security as well as intelligence activities abroad. He remembers with bitter clarity that fateful evening when he received the first slim clue to Eichmann's whereabouts: ""That night I resolved that if Eichmann were alive, come hell or high water he'd be caught.""",Hardcover,,296 pages,"

","Shelby Foote's magnificently orchestrated novel anticipates much of the subject matter of his monumental Civil War trilogy, rendering the clash between North and South with a violence all the more shocking for its intimacy. Love in a Dry Season describes an erotic and economic triangle, in which two wealthy and fantastically unhappy Mississippi families—the Barcrofts and the Carrutherses—are joined by an open-faced fortune hunter from the North, a man whose ruthlessness is matched only by his inability to understand the people he tries to exploit and his fatal incomprehension of the passions he so casually ignites. Combining a flawless sense of place with a Faulknerian command of the grotesque, Foote's novel turns a small cotton town into a sexual battleground as fatal as Vicksburg or Shiloh—and one where strategy is no match for instinct and tradition.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","In this illuminating new work on the geography of poverty, David Rain dispels the notion that relentless human mobility is a byproduct of Western technological advances like superhighways and airports. Instead, it is much older and more deeply ingrained in the human spirit. Every year after the rainy season ends in the arid West African Sahel, hundreds of thousands of men and women leave their villages to work in the informal economies of West African cities. The seasonal flux of peasants swells urban markets and neighborhoods, as it has for centuries. These migrants, called masu cin rani in Hausa, or “those who eat the dry season,” travel after their crops are harvested in order to conserve household food supplies and earn money which is funneled back to their villages of origin. These “eaters” come from all walks of life, though they are more commonly poor and living by their wits.This book focuses on the activities of the seasonal migrants, persisting as they have through colonial and postcolonial changes, and constituting an important response to uncertainty in the region. Based on a combination of survey-interviews and geographic analysis, the book regards the migrants as practical people who are simply making the best of what has been dealt to them. Contextual andpanoramic, and centered on the immediacy of daily and seasonal routines, Eaters of the Dry Season delves deeper than typical alarmist accounts of African drought and famine, which are all too common in current literature. It will challenge laypeople as well as scholars and policymakers to consider how actual people respond to global changes in the next century, especially for the billions who are labeled “poor.” Unraveling the dynamics behind population, environment, and poverty requires us to set our sights on the intersection of the human and the physical realms, and to enter the worlds inhabited by the poor.",Paperback,,280 pages,"

","Ramsey Campbell, the highly regarded British horror author called him, ""the greatest living writer of supernatural horror fiction"". Drawing many of his own themes from Shakespeare, Edgar Allen Poe, and H.P Lovecraft, master manipulator Franz Leiber is a worldwide legend within the Fantasy genre, actually coining the term ""Sword and Sorcery"" that would describe the sub-genre he would more than help create. While Lord of the Rings took the world by storm, Leiber's fantastic but thoroughly flawed anti-heroes, Fafhrd and Grey Mouser, adventured and stumbled deep within the caves of Inner Earth as well, albeit a different one. They wondered and wandered to the edges of the Outer Sea, across the Land of Nehwon and throughout every nook and cranny of gothic Lankhmar, Nehwon's grandest and most mystically corrupt city. Lankhmar, is Leiber's fully realized, vivid, incarnation of urban decay and civilization's corroding effect on the human psyche. Fafhrd and Mouser are not innocents; their world is no land of honor and righteousness. It is a world of human complexities and violent action, of discovery and mystery, of swords and sorcery. ""Fritz Leiber's tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are virtually a genre unto themselves. Urbane, idiosyncratic, comic, erotic and human, spiked with believable action of a master fantasist!"" William Gibson ""After too long a wait, the master story teller of us all returns with a huge, anecdotal adventure in the magic-drenched lives of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Glowing imagination melds with gorgeous language to make this one of Leiber's very best...which is a better best than this poor world usually has to offer. Leiber's back: rejoice!"" -Harlan Ellison ""It's all Fritz Leiber's fault. If he weren't such a deadly fine fantasist I wouldn't be stopping everything to read his tales. And if he weren't such a master I wouldn't occasionally look out of the window and wish he'd interrupt my routine again, as he doesn't do it often enough. The Knight and Knave of Swords came into my life and took over an otherwise fully programmed afternoon. I stop everything when a new Fafhrd and Gray Mouser story comes into my hands.""

","The ""German question"" haunts the modern world: How could so civilized a nation be responsible for the greatest horror in Western history? In this unusual fusion of personal memoir and history, the celebrated scholar Fritz Stern refracts the question through the prism of his own life. Born in the Weimar Republic, exposed to five years of National Socialism before being forced into exile in 1938 in America, he became a world-renowned historian whose work opened new perspectives on the German past.Stern brings to life the five Germanys he has experienced: Weimar, the Third Reich, postwar West and East Germanys, and the unified country after 1990. Through his engagement with the nation from which he and his family fled, he shows that the tumultuous history of Germany, alternately the strength and the scourge of Europe, offers political lessons for citizens everywhere--especially those facing or escaping from tyranny. In this wise, tough-minded, and subtle book, Stern, himself a passionately engaged citizen, looks beyond Germany to issues of political responsibility that concern everyone. Five Germanys I Have Known vindicates his belief that, at its best, history is our most dramatic introduction to a moral civic life.",Hardcover,,546 pages,"

","Benedict Arnold always carried things too far. As a boy he did crazy things like climbing atop a burning roof and picking a fight with the town constable. As a soldier, he was even more reckless. He was obsessed with being the leader and the hero in every battle, and he never wanted to surrender. He even killed his own horse once rather than give it to the enemy.   Where did the extremism lead Arnold? To treason.   America's most notorious traitor is brought to life as Jean Fritz relays the engrossing story of Benedict Arnold -- a man whose pride, ambition, and self-righteousness drove him to commit the heinous crime of treason against the United States during the American Revolution. “A highly entertaining biography illuminating the personality of a complex man.” —Horn Book “A gripping story. . .

","  Fire. It violently destroys futures and pasts in a terrified heartbeat, devouring damning secrets while leaving even greater mysteries in its foul wake of ash and debris.    The night sky is ablaze as fire engulfs two barges moored end to end on a Yorkshire canal. On board are the blackened remains of two human beings. One was a reclusive and eccentric local artist, the other a junkie, a sad and damaged young girl.   To the seasoned eye of Inspector Alan Banks, this horror was no accident, its method so cruel and calculated that only the worst sort of fiend could have committed the dark act. And it isn't long before the fears of Banks and D.I. Annie Cabbot are brutally confirmed, when another suspicious blaze incinerates a remote trailer in the countryside . . . and another solitary life is gruesomely consumed.   But is it the work of a serial arsonist, or an ingeniously conceived plot to obliterate the trail to other heinous crimes? There are shocking secrets to be uncovered in the charred wreckage, grim evidence of lethal greed and twisted hunger, and of nightmare occurrences within the private confines of family. A terrible suspicion that a killer's work is not yet done drives Alan Banks as the hunt intensifies for an elusive, cold-blooded chameleon who could be anyone and anywhere.   In Playing with Fire, award-winning, internationally bestselling author Peter Robinson delivers a modern masterwork of suspense that confirms his standing as one of the brightest literary lights in crime fiction -- a blistering tale of murder and betrayal that is as frightening, devastating, and hypnotic as flame itself.

","Seven voices contribute to this rare glimpse of the work being done on the front lines of the fight for social change in India. Playing with Fire is written in the collective voice of women employed by a large NGO as activists in their communities and is based on diaries, interviews, and conversations among them. Together their personal stories reveal larger themes and questions of sexism, casteism, and communalism, and a startling picture emerges of how NGOs both nourish and stifle local struggles for solidarity. The Hindi edition of the book, Sangtin Yatra, published in 2004, created controversy that resulted in backlash against the authors by their employer. The publication also drew support for the women and instigated a public conversation about the issues exposed in the book. Here, Richa Nagar addresses the dispute in the context of the politics of NGOs and feminist theory, articulating how development ideology employed by aid organizations serves to reinforce the domination of those it claims to help. The Sangtin Writers, Anupamlata, Ramsheela, Reshma Ansari, Richa Singh, Shashibala, Shashi Vaish, Surbala, and Vibha Bajpayee, are grassroots activists and members of a small organization called Sangtin in Uttar Pradesh, India. Richa Nagar teaches women’s studies at the University of Minnesota.",Paperback,,232 pages,"

","In this work, the smoldering hatred of the Korean War period resurfaces decades later in the form of a ruthless quest for justice. The main character, a successful Seoul businessman, has a secret past: unknown to his wife and son, he once led another life under another name as a ruthless communist partisan. After a lifelong search, the son of one of his wartime victims discovers his true identity, then proceeds calmly and deliberately to exact a terrible revenge.  Playing With Fire was awarded the prestigious Korean National Literature Prize upon its publication in 1982. Cho Chong-Rae's novella ""Land of Exile"" appeared in English translation in 1992. Cho subsequently published the immensely popular ten-volume historical novel The Taebaek Mountains (Taebaek Sanmaek), which sold millions in Korea in the late 1980s and was successfully adapted into a film. In the 1990s Cho continued his success with Arirang, another ten-volume roman fleuve set in the period of Japan's occupation of Korea.",Paperback,,202 pages,"

","European sculptors of the Neoclassical period often modeled their works in clay before producing finished pieces in marble. These terracotta models are often more animated and revealing than the finished marbles and provide extraordinary insights into the creative process. This book offers the first comprehensive overview of Neoclassical terracotta models by European artists, featuring the works of Pajou, Houdon, and Canova, among many others. Leading scholars analyse modeling at every stage, from the brusque preliminary impulse to the highly finished statuette that is a work of art in its own right. They also comment on related issues: the model's role in the statuary of great men and in tomb sculpture; the sculptors' depictions of arcadia and the loves of the gods; the centering of activity in Rome, site of the collections of antiquities; and much more. Some 135 terracotta models are presented and reproduced, and short biographies of the artists are also included. This book is the catalogue for an exhibition that will be on view at the Musee du Louvre, Paris (September 15, 2003 to January 5, 2004); The Metropolitan Museum of Art (January 26 to April 23, 2004); and the Nationalmus""",Hardcover,,348 pages,"

"," Mutiny on the Bounty is one of history's greatest naval stories -- yet few know the similar tale from America's own fledgling navy in the dying days of the Age of Sail, a tale of mutiny and death at sea on an American warship.  In 1842, the brig-of-war Somers set out on a training cruise for apprentice seamen, commanded by rising star Alexander Mackenzie. Somers was crammed with teenagers. Among them was Acting Midshipman Philip Spencer, a disturbed youth and a son of the U.S. Secretary of War. Buying other crew members' loyalty with pilfered tobacco and alcohol, Spencer dreamed up a scheme to kill the officers and turn Somers into a pirate ship.  In the isolated world of a warship, a single man can threaten the crew's discipline and the captain's authority. But one of Spencer's followers warned Mackenzie, who arrested the midshipman and chained him and other ringleaders to the quarterdeck. Fearing efforts to rescue the prisoners, officers had to stay awake in round-the-clock watches. Steering desperately for land, sleep-deprived and armed to the teeth, battling efforts to liberate Spencer, Somers's captain and officers finally faced a fateful choice: somehow keep control of the vessel until reaching port -- still hundreds of miles away -- or hang the midshipman and his two leading henchmen before the boys could take over the ship.  The results shook the nation. A naval investigation of the affair turned into a court-martial and a state trial and led to the founding of the Naval Academy to provide better officers for the still-young republic. Mackenzie's controversial decision may have inspired Herman Melville's great work Billy Budd. The story of Somers raises timeless questions still disturbing in twenty-first-century America: the relationship between civil and military law, the hazy line between peace and war, the battle between individual rights and national security, and the ultimate challenge of command at sea.",Hardcover,,301 pages,"

Thompson himself seems nonplussed. He continues to write marvelously mordant songs, and to wring his own brand of Celtic angst from the electric guitar. Meanwhile, the journalist Patrick Humphries has taken on the Boswell role, taping hours of interviews and running down all the requisite sources. The result is this lively Life of Thompson, which includes an airtight discography and some goofy photos that only a fearless man would allow to be published.",Paperback,,,"

","Without a doubt, the family and friends of fictional sleuths are two of the most endangered species on the planet. Crime novelists seem to have no qualms about sacrificing the people nearest and dearest to their protagonists, if doing so will advance plot development or bestow emotional depth upon their series stars. Peter Robinson continues this ruthless tradition in Strange Affair, his tension-packed 15th novel featuring headstrong British Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks. Still on the mend after the blazing finale of 2004's Playing with Fire, temporarily sworn off whiskey but back to smoking, Banks is interrupted in the midst of brooding over his life and failed relationships by a message from his estranged younger brother, Roy, who says he needs the DCI's help in ""a matter of life and death."" Concerned, especially since Roy boasts a history of dubious business dealings, Banks leaves Yorkshire for his sibling's home in London, only to find that residence unlocked, Roy's computer missing, and his cell phone left behind. After learning that Roy was last seen stepping into a car with an unidentified man, and receiving on Roy's mobile what appears to be a photo of his only brother slumped over in a chair, the cop fears that a kidnapping has occurred.Meanwhile, back in Eastvale, Banks's colleague and ex-lover, Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot, probes the shooting death of Jennifer Clewes, a 27-year-old family planning center administrator from London who's been found in her car, with the address of Banks's once-ruined (and recently broken into) cottage tucked into her jeans pocket. As Annie seeks to identify Clewes's attacker and determine whether this crime fits a pattern of roadway assaults, she's anxious also to discover what connection Banks may have to the case. But the DCI is frustratingly nowhere to be found.Like 2003's Close to Home, Strange Affair adds some welcome bricks to Banks's back story, this time forcing him to reappraise a brother whom he had long resented and distrusted. Simultaneously, Robinson's latest police procedural delivers artfully contrived, intersecting story lines charged with rumors of international arms dealing, hints of misdeeds at a women's clinic, secondary players so shady they might be invisible after sundown, and insights into just how far Banks's career has distanced him from folks less steeped in the ugly side of mankind. An immensely satisfying mystery, filled with professional risks and personal regrets, this is truly an Affair to remember. --J. Kingston Pierce",Audio CD,Abridged,0 pages,"

","This essay collection fills a critical gap by examining Fritz Leiber and his work from an academic perspective. Examined here are the role of civilization in Leiber's work; the evolution of Our Lady of Darkness; the concept of time; death, rebirth and existentialism; feline characters; sexual desire; his gothic and weird tales; eccentricity in Leiber's poems; the theme of power in the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser adventures; connecting threads, and important contrasts between Leiber and Lovecraft; and biblical influence.",Paperback,,207 pages,"

","From the moment when they first met, in the commission of the same, audacious theft, Fafhrd, the giant barbarian warrior from the Cold Waste, and the Gray Mouser, master thief, novice wizard and expert swordsman, felt no ordinary affinity. Forged over the gleam of sharpened steel as, back to back, they faced their foes, theirs was a friendship that would take them from adventure to misadventure across all of Nehwon, from the caves of the inner earth to the waves of the outer sea. But it was in the dark alleys and noisome back streets of the great fog-shrouded city of Lankhmar that they became legends.The First Book of Lankhmar includes the first four volumes of the hugely enjoyable Swords series.",Paperback,,762 pages,"

But for a girl like Audrey, this is not as easy as it sounds.When Patrick Dugan, the charismatic owner of an old-world bar, fixes Audrey in his sights, some strange alliances are about to be formed.

","Forgotten Soldier recounts the horror of World War II on the eastern front, as seen through the eyes of a teenaged German soldier. At first an exciting adventure, young Guy Sajer’s war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all the terrifying Soviet artillery. As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland Division, he fought in all the great battles from Kursk to Kharkov. Sajer's German footsoldier’s perspective makes The Forgotten Soldier a unique war memoir, the book that the Christian Science Monitor said ""may well be the book about World War II which has been so long awaited."" Now it has been handsomely republished containing fifty rare German combat photos of life and death at the eastern front. The photos of troops battling through snow, mud, burned villages, and rubble-strewn cities depict the hardships and destructiveness of war. Many are originally from the private collections of German soldiers and have never been published before. This volume is a deluxe edition of a true classic.",Paperback,,465 pages,"

The axiom that the winners of wars write the histories is especially valid in regard to the story of the Irish who fought for the Confederacy from 1861–1865. Throughout the course of the Civil War, Irish Confederates made invaluable contributions to all aspects of the war effort. Yet, the Irish have largely been the forgotten soldiers of the South. In Irish Confederates: The Civil War's Forgotten Soldiers, Tucker illuminates these overlooked participants.  ",Paperback,,128 pages,"

By the time they were repatriated to France after Napoleon's defeat five years later, their number had dwindled to 2,500. Never before told in English, the story of Cabrera is not only a riveting account of survival and the community formed by these men, but also an intriguing look at the politics of divided Spain during this period.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

Along with the property, they have inherited some worthless bric-a-brac, including a collection of antique books. While rustling through a copy of The Black Arrow, Tuppence comes upon a series of apparently random underlinings.

His deconstruction of the classic monster stretched the creative boundaries of the medium and became one of the most spectacular series in comic book history.With modern-day issues explored against a backdrop of horror, SWAMP THING's stories became commentaries on environmental, political and social issues, unflinching in their relevance. SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING Book One collects issues #20-27 of this seminal series including the never-before-reprinted SAGA OF THE SWAMP THING #20, where Moore takes over as writer and concludes the previous storyline.Book One begins with the story ""The Anatomy Lesson,"" a haunting origin story that reshapes SWAMP THING mythology with terrifying revelations that begin a journey of discovery and adventure that will take him across the stars and beyond.",Paperback,,173 pages,"

","A renowned 19th-century cultural historian and specialist on the Middle Ages, J. H. Hefner-Alteneck spent much of his life observing the influence of art on many aspects of human life, including weaponry. His illustrations for this handsome archive — drawn with incredible exactitude — depict a wide array of medieval weapons and armor dating from the early ninth century to the mid-1700s.Adapted primarily from decorative ornamentation on burial monuments and manuscripts, hundreds of finely executed images depict authentic shields, swords, crossbows, helmets, and highly ornate suits of body armor for knights and their steeds. Newly translated descriptive notes, extracted from the original German text, identify the subjects. First published more than 100 years ago, this meticulously rendered study remains an invaluable source of permission-free illustrations for artists and designers and an indispensable reference for scholars, collectors, and hobbyists.",Paperback,,112 pages,"

To help readers infuse the rich traditions of Judaism into daily life, he examines what the Bible and the Talmud tell us regarding how to treat the environment, what greater roles women may play in Judaism, and how to allow worship to become an integral part of our lives.Rabbi Waskow also brings to life the history of many prayers, ceremonies, and laws, such as Kosher or Kashrut. Through his thoughtful interweaving of these four central areas, Rabbi Waskow celebrates the relevance of Jewish tradition to modern times.",Paperback,,416 pages,"

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewMartha Grimes fans will be thrilled to hear that her second Richard Jury novel, The Old Fox Deceiv'd, is finally back in print after an absence of nearly 20 years. In this traditional English mystery, Detective Chief Inspector Richard Jury of New Scotland Yard joins forces with noble-born amateur investigator Melrose Plant to unravel a puzzling case in the quaint and usually quiet northern fishing village of Rackmoor: Near midnight on Twelfth Night, on the steep and shadowy Angel Steps of Rackmoor, a costumed reveler is found savagely stabbed to death. The victim is soon identified as a visitor named Gemma Temple, and authorities are puzzled as to who might have had cause to kill a stranger in this usually quiet town. Motives and connections soon abound when it's revealed that the costume she was killed in was only one of the victim's disguises -- that she's been claiming to be Dillys March, the long-missing but seldom-missed ward of a wealthy local landowner and avid fox hunter. This story is vintage Martha Grimes, with well-drawn characters, an evocative setting, and an intricate plot that stands the test of time. Sue Stone",Audiobook,Abridged,0 pages,"

","Bestselling author Naomi Wolf was brought up to believe that happiness is something that can be taught -- and learned. In this magical book, Naomi shares the enduring wisdom of her father, Leonard Wolf, a poet and teacher who believes that every person is an artist in their own unique way, and that personal creativity is the secret of happiness.  Leonard Wolf is a true eccentric. A tall, craggy, good-looking man in his early eighties, he's the kind of person who likes to use a medieval astrolabe, dress in Basque shepherd's clothing, and convince otherwise sensible people to quit their jobs and follow their passions. A gifted teacher, he's dedicated his life to honoring individualism, creativity, and the inspirational power of art. Leonard believes, and has made many others believe, that inside everyone is an artist, and success and happiness in life depend on whether or not one values and acts upon one's creative impulse. In The Treehouse, Naomi Wolf's most personal book yet, Naomi outlines her father's lessons in creating lasting happiness and offers inspiration for the artist in all of us.  The book begins when Naomi asks Leonard to help build a treehouse for his granddaughter. Inspired by his dedication to her daughter's imaginative world, Naomi asks her father to walk her through the lessons of his popular poetry class and show her how he teaches people to liberate their creative selves. Drawn from Leonard's handwritten lecture notes, the chapters of The Treehouse remind us to ""Be Still and Listen,"" ""Use Your Imagination,"" ""Do Nothing Without Passion,"" and that ""Your Only Wage Will Be Joy,"" and ""Mistakes Are Part of the Draft."" More than an education in poetry writing, this is a journey of self-discovery in which the creative endeavor is paramount.  Naomi also offers glimpses into her father's past -- from his youth during the Depression to his bohemian years as a poet in 1950s San Francisco -- and the evolution of Leonard's highly individualistic vision of the artist's way. She reconsiders her own childhood and realizes the transformative effect Leonard's philosophy has had on her own life, as well as the lives of her students and friends. The Treehouse is ultimately a stirring personal history, a meditation on fathers and daughters, an argument for honoring the creative impulse, and unique instruction in the art of personal happiness.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","This reference provides a comprehensive survey of human rights in Judaism. It includes both theoretical discussions of the nature and substance of human rights and practical applications of that theory either by Jews or to Jews. While numerous dissertations and audio-visual materials focus on human rights and Judaism, the bibliography is limited to books and articles. The majority of the works have been written in English or Hebrew, but significant studies in other languages, chiefly French and German, have also been included. The volume contains more than 700 citations, each accompanied by a descriptive annotation.The book begins with an introductory essay that examines the basic concerns of the works that follow. The annotated entries are then presented in five chapters. The first chapter includes anthologies, references, and periodicals. The second chapter includes studies of human rights in the Bible and Talmud. The third chapter includes works on Jewish theories of human rights. The fourth chapter, broken down into smaller sections, includes works on Judaism and particular human rights. The fifth chapter contains entries for works on contemporary Judaism and human rights. The volume concludes with author, title, and subject indexes.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","In The Beauty Myth the fearless Naomi Wolf revolutionized the way we think about beauty. In Misconceptions, she demythologizes motherhood and reveals the dangers of common assumptions about childbirth. With uncompromising honesty she describes how hormones eroded her sense of independence, ultrasounds tested her commitment to abortion rights, and the keepers of the OB/GYN establishment lacked compassion. The weeks after her first daughter’s birth taught her how society, employers, and even husbands can manipulate new mothers. She had bewildering post partum depression, but learned that a surprisingly high percentage of women experience it. Wolf’s courageous willingness to talk about the unexpected difficulties of childbirth will help every woman become a more knowledgeable planner of her pregnancy and better prepare her for the challenges of balancing a career, freedom, and a growing family. Invaluable in its advice to parents, Misconceptions speaks to anyone connected–personally, medically, or professionally–to a new mother.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

Embarking on a voyage of discovery, she illustrates how flawed and prescribed are the notions of what women want, and how these change through the ages - from Taoist techniques for giving women pleasure, to Victorian repression, and the so-called liberated nineties.Drawing on scholarly texts, secret diaries, real life and fantasy, she demonstrates that female sexuality is wilder, more demanding and more powerful than our culture dares to accept.",Paperback,,244 pages,"

","Part memoir, part exposé, Promiscuities is Naomi Wolf's (author of The Beauty Myth and Fire with Fire) perspective on the confusion surrounding female sexuality. According to Wolf, promiscuous is ""a word that holds within it the mixed message girls today are given about sex: 'You're promiscuous if you do anything, but you are a prude if you do nothing.'"" Thus, still polarized on the spectrum between virgin and whore, adolescent girls are allowed little information and even fewer healthy outlets for their normal sexual desires. Wolf shatters the illusion that good girls and professional women are not sexual, and boldly embarks on redefining female sexuality outside of men's experience and assumptions. Wolf's own coming of age in the post-sexual revolution of Haight-Ashbury, serves as an evocative tool for revealing the naked and admirable truth of female sexuality. ",Paperback,,,"

","Promiscuities follows a group of adolescent girls as they gradually become aware of themselves as sexual beings and discover what our culture tells them being female means. Drawing on her own experiences as well those of her contemporaries, Naomi Wolf reveals the secrets of our coming of age: the sexual games, forbidden crushes, losses of virginity, and rites of initiation. She also uncompromisingly examines the darker territories of abortion, the influences of the sex industry, and sexual violence that underlie contemporary girl's struggle for womanhood. By bringing into light our relationship to the ""shadow slut"" that conditions our sexual development, Promiscuities explores how the sexual experiences of the adolescent years determine women's sense of their own value as adults, and envisions how we could better guide girls through the ""normatively shocking"" landscape they now inhabit. Finally, Wolf looks at the popular culture of the recent past, as well as at the history and mythology of female desire, to show how our ""liberated"" culture still fears and distorts female passion. Bold and candid, funny and revelatory, Wolf's stories illustrate the fear and excitement, the fantasies and sometimes crippling realities, that make up a young contemporary woman's journey of erotic and emotional discovery.",Hardcover,,286 pages,"

","In her first two books, Byron Katie showed how suffering can be ended by questioning the stressful thoughts that create it, through a process of self-inquiry she calls The Work. Now, in A Thousand Names for Joy, she encourages us to discover the freedom that lives on the other side of inquiry. Stephen Mitchell–the renowned translator of the Tao Te Ching–selected provocative excerpts from that ancient text as a stimulus for Katie to talk about the most essential issues that face us all: life and death, good and evil, love, work, and fulfillment. The result is an audiobook that allows the timeless insights of the Tao Te Ching to resonate anew for us today, while offering a vivid and illuminating glimpse into the life of someone who for twenty years–ever since she “woke up to reality” one morning in 1986–has been living what Lao-tzu wrote more than 2,500 years ago. With her stories of total ease in all circumstances, Katie does more than describe the awakened mind; she lets you see it, feel it, in action. And she shows you how that mind is yours as well.",Audio CD,Abridged,0 pages,"

Solomon's Song of Songs--a love story told by God Himself--is an often-overlooked message to the modern woman that can impact every area of her life--her relationship with her husband, parents, children, in-laws, friends, and most importantly, with the Shepherd who created her. Author Iva May contends that to ignore the Old Testament book, filled with oriental imagery and metaphors and sometimes considered difficult to understand, is to miss learning and applying marvelous truths about Christian marriage as well as about one's intimate walk with the Lord. The Song's main character--the Shulamite woman--is a biblical Cinderella who can help today's woman answer such questions as ""Who am I?,"" ""What does being a woman mean?,"" and ""What can I do to deal with suffering and pain?""",Paperback,,260 pages,"

","'It is my Royal and Imperial Command that you concentrate your energies and the valour of my soldiers to exterminate the treacherous English and walk over General French's contemptible little army.'  So spoke Kaiser Wilhelm II of Imperial Germany in August 1914.  But as it turned out, walking over the 'Old Contemptibles', those implacable riflemen of the British Expeditionary Force, proved a tougher task than the Kaiser imagined - and beyond the capability of the German armies. At Mons, Le Cateau, the Marne, on the Aisne and at the Battle of First Ypres, they shot the Kaiser's legions to pieces. This is the dramatic story of how those men, regular soldiers from every walk of life, plunged into this new and terrible war, held their muddy trenches against impossible odds and gave the Empire time to muster its forces and ready itself for the long struggle ahead.  'The Old Contemptibles' brings those battles vividly to life in all their terror and glory. But Robin Neillands does more than explain the role of the BEF in the early months of the First World War. He also tells the story of why they were sent to France and of that wily officer, General Henry Wilson, whose years of secret intrigue with the French High Command first committed the British Army to this global war.  'Excellent' - Literary Review  'Informed and explicit, this is military history at its best' - Western Daily Press  'Brings to life the horrific experiences of the British Expeditionary Force' - Soldier  Robin Neillands is the author of several acclaimed works on the First World War including ‘The Great War Generals on the Western Front’, ‘Attrition: The Great War on the Western Front, 1916’ and ‘The Death of Glory’.  Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent publisher of digital books. ",Paperback,,,"

","Osprey's study of British forces from the time of the Second Boer War (1899-1902) up to World War I (1914-1918). On 19 August 1914 Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered General von Kluck, commanding the German First Army, to 'exterminate the treacherous English and walk over General French's contemptible little Army'. The 'Old Contemptibles' adopted the aspersion like a treasured regimental title, their subsequent successes earning them a more accurate evaluation as 'the best trained, best organised and best equipped British Army that ever went forth to war'. This book examines the history, organization and uniforms of the British Expeditionary Force of the early 20th century. The text is accompanied by numerous illustrations, including maps, photographs, and colour plates.",Paperback,,64 pages,"

A professional soldier at the outbreak, Edward Roe was one of the first to cross over to France in 1914 and as such fought in the early battles of the war and took part in the Retreat from Mons. He was there for the crossing of the Marne and Aisne, the dreadful fighting at Ploegsteert and for the extraordinary events during the first Christmas. Remarkably he witnessed the debacle at Gallipoli and was part of the rear-guard of the Army during the re-embarkation and evacuation of the Peninsula. Thereafter the scene shifts to Mesopotania and the Tigris Corps in the attempt to relieve General Townshend at Kut. Wounded he returned for the final campaign that captured Baghdad",Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","""Till death do us part,"" ""Forsaking all others"": Marriage demands lifelong fidelity - at least in theory. Yet there is evidence that more than 50 percent of all partners have affairs at some time in their marriage. In this profoundly hopeful book about married couples facing transitions, overcoming pain, and sustaining marriage in the wake of infidelity, Janet Reibstein and Martin Richards outline their groundbreaking ideas about affairs and the healthy marriage. They show exactly what is wrong with the concept of marriage - that one's wife or husband will satisfy all of his or her partner's social and sexual needs. Highlighting the real stories of the many couples they have worked with in therapy, Reibstein and Richards demonstrate how the structure of marriage itself may encourage affairs. The greatest lover, the best father or mother, the perfect companion and best friend - we expect our partner to be everything to us, and inevitably the experience of marriage falls short of our expectations. But by identifying - and demolishing - the myths of marriage, the authors reveal how men and women can reconcile their fantasies with the reality they live every day. Elucidating the particularly vulnerable stress points in marriagesurprisingly, the first year is one - the authors demonstrate why affairs do not necessarily mean that a marriage has failed. The authors discuss the role of secrecy in marriage, and explain how affairs are very different for husbands and wives. (More women than ever are having affairs and, contrary to stereotype, they are having affairs that are primarily about sex, not love.) They also examine the impact of affairs on children. Sexual Arrangements is a revelatory book that will help reshape our understanding of how to make marriage fulfilling and enduring.",Hardcover,,226 pages,"

","Ralph Roberts has a problem: he isn't sleeping so well these days. In fact, he's hardly sleeping at all. Each morning, the news conveyed by the bedside clock is a little worse: 3:15...3:02...2:45...2:15. The books call it ""premature waking""; Ralph, who is still learning to be a widower, calls it a season in hell. He's begun to notice a strangeness in his familiar surroundings, to experience visual phenomena that he can't quite believe are hallucinations. Soon, Ralph thinks, he won't be sleeping at all, and what then?A problem, yes - though perhaps not so uncommon, you might say. But Ralph has lived his entire life in Derry, Maine, and Derry isn't like other places, as millions of Stephen King readers will gladly testify. They remember It, also set in Derry, and know there's a mean streak running through this small New England city; underneath its ordinary surface awesome and terrifying forces are at work. The dying, natural and otherwise, has been going on in Derry for a long, long time. Now Ralph is part of it. So are his friends. And so are the strangers they encounter.You, Gentle Reader, may never sleep again.Welcome to Insomnia.Also see: Alternate Cover Editions for this ISBN [ACE]

","Since his wife died, Ralph Roberts has been having trouble sleeping. Each night he wakes up a bit earlier, until he’s barely sleeping at all. During his late night walks, he observes some strange things going on in Derry, Maine. He sees colored ribbons streaming from people’s heads, two strange little men wandering around town after dark, and more. He begins to suspect that these visions are something more than hallucinations brought on by lack of sleep. There’s a definite mean streak running through this small New England city; underneath its ordinary surface awesome and terrifying forces are at work. The dying has been going on in Derry for a long, long time. Now Ralph is part of it…and lack of sleep is the least of his worries. Returning to the same Maine town where It took place, a town that has haunted Stephen King for decades, Insomnia blends King’s trademark bone-chilling realism with supernatural terror to create yet another masterpiece of suspense.",,,,,"['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy']"

This is a landscape that can easily deceive, the fens, a landscape that volunteers nothing, as if to say, a landscape that volunteers nothing, as to say, You're on your own, mate–much like the habitues of the only pub for miles around called The Case Has Altered. The Lincolnshire fens are the right setting for Richard Jury's latest case, a mystifying double murder. The body of one woman is found on the wash; another woman lies floating in a canal in Windy Fen. Both women are connected with Fengate: Dorcas Reese, a servant; Verna Dunn, the louche ex-wife of the owner, Max Owen, a man with a passion for antiques. So when the principal suspect turns out to be Jenny Kennington, a woman Jury has long loved, he decides he needs someone inside Fengate, someone who can impersonate an antiques expert...",Hardcover,,,"

","The Camargue, the vast and swampy region in southern France, has always been known for its wild horses. Herding together in groups, the horses live in this rural area of the Rhône delta in a semi-wild state, surviving on the poor vegetation of marshes where only reeds, glasswort, and couch grass grow. An undeniable product of this hostile but spectacular triangle of land, the Camargue horses are characterized by their small stature, wild appearance, and hardy nature. Even their coats seem to reflect some secret evolutionary process: the foals, black or dark brown at birth, gradually turn gray and, finally, in adulthood, pure white.Renowned photographer Hans Silvester demonstrated incredible patience and persistence in this wild, windy environment in order to capture the spirit and endless grace of the region’s famous inhabitants. Hours of waiting were necessary to earn the timid animals’ trust, but the results are these magnificent images, which allow us to catch a glimpse of the Camargue horses’ daily lives. We witness their fourteen-hour feedings as well as their periods of rest, when they sit in groups under the watchful eyes of one horse. We see the horses swimming in sweet-water marshes, galloping in herds in the vast expanses, fighting to establish hierarchy, romping in the fields, and relaxing in a rare patch of shade. We are even brought into the intimate life of mares giving birth and tending to their foals while they nurse, play, and nap. In the accompanying text, journalist Sophie Delavoie takes us on a journey through the unique history and the present-day struggles and rewards of all those who inhabit the rugged Camargue. Thisbook offers a rare opportunity to view wild-horse behavior that will intrigue all horse lovers and fans of animal photography.",Hardcover,,,"

","Tom Veitch's original comic strip story traces Luke Skywalker's entrance into the Dark Side in the years after the fall of Darth Vader. The Empire is fragmented, and the Rebels seem on the verge of winning their long struggle when the sinister power of World Devastators emerges from the galactic core. These Devastators chew up worlds and manufacture robotic war machines out of the resources they consume. Luke's dark journey seems the only way to halt the massacre. But despite the importance of Luke in Dark Empire, the portrayal of Leia as an emerging Jedi is really the centerpiece of this volume. Married to Han (who goes flat in Veitch's hands) and with two children, Leia is torn between her role as mother and her role as Jedi warrior. While the story sometimes jumps too quickly between major scenes, Veitch does a good job of capturing the epic feel of George Lucas's masterpiece trilogy. Cam Kennedy's artwork is mixed in quality. Some of his drawings of the Millennium Falcon, hunter-killer probes, and robotic TIE-fighters seem to leap directly from the movie screen, while his human figures (especially of Han and Luke) can appear generic. Also, his style of coloring, using washes of similar colors on each page, is good for capturing moods but tends to obscure details. Despite these occasional shortcoming, this comic is recommended for one simple reason: once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down. The other two parts of the Dark Empire trilogy include: Dark Empire II and Empire's End.--Patrick O'Kelley",Unknown Binding,,,"

Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he’s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son’s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access—through nodes designed into smart clothes—and to see the digital context—through smart contact lenses.  With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination.  In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert’s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot.  As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected.",Paperback,,381 pages,"

","Unprecedented in its scope, Rainbow's End provides a bold new analysis of the emergence, growth, and decline of six classic Irish- American political machines in New York, Jersey City, Chicago, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Albany. Combining the approaches of political economy and historical sociology, Erie examines a wide range of issues, including the relationship between city and state politics, the manner in which machines shaped ethnic and working-class politics, and the reasons why centralized party organizations failed to emerge in Boston and Philadelphia despite their large Irish populations. The book ends with a thorough discussion of the significance of machine politics for today's urban minorities.",Unknown Binding,,358 pages,"

","Rainbow's End tells the story of the stock market collapse in a colorful, swift-moving narrative that blends a vivid portrait of the 1920s with an intensely gripping account of Wall Street's greatest catastrophe. The book offers a vibrant picture of a world full of plungers, powerful bankers, corporate titans, millionaire brokers, and buoyantly optimistic stock market bulls. We meet Sunshine Charley Mitchell, head of the National City Bank, powerful financiers Jack Morgan and Jacob Schiff, Wall Street manipulators such as the legendary Jesse Livermore, and the lavish-living Billy Durant, founder of General Motors. As Klein follows the careers of these men, he shows us how the financial house of cards gradually grew taller, as the irrational exuberance of an earlier age gripped America and convinced us that the market would continue to rise forever. Then, in October 1929, came a ""perfect storm""-like convergence of factors that shook Wall Street to its foundations. We relive Black Thursday, when police lined Wall Street, brokers grew hysterical, customers ""bellowed like lunatics,"" and the ticker tape fell hours behind.This compelling history of the Crash--the first to follow the market closely for the two years leading up to the disaster--illuminates a major turning point in our history.",Paperback,,368 pages,"

But a devastating tragedy will force Summer to stare into the cold eyes of adulthood long before she is ready. She will learn very quickly about hardship -- but what of hope? Is she as strong as her courageous mother? Or will she crumble?  All her life, Summer has lived on the Virginia estate where the Hudson family's secrets have lurked among the shadows for generations.

","This is a story about a paradise lost. . . . About an African dream that began with a murder . . .In 1978, in the final, bloodiest phase of the Rhodesian civil war, eleven-year-old Lauren St John moves with her family to Rainbow's End, a wild, beautiful farm and game reserve set on the banks of a slowflowing river. The house has been the scene of a horrific attack by guerrillas, and when Lauren's family settles there, a chain of events is set in motion that will change her life irrevocably.""Rainbow's End"" captures the overwhelming beauty and extraordinary danger of life in the African bush. Lauren's childhood reads like a girl's own adventure story. At the height of the war, Lauren rides through the wilderness on her horse, Morning Star, encountering lions, crocodiles, snakes, vicious ostriches, and mad cows. Many of the animals are pets, including Miss Piggy and Bacon and an elegant giraffe named Jenny. The constant threat of ruthless guerrillas prowling the land underscores everything, making each day more dangerous, vivid, and prized than the last.After Independence, Lauren comes to the bitter realization that she'd been on the wrong side of the civil war. While she and her family believed that they were fighting for democracy over Communism, others saw the war as black against white. And when Robert Mugabe comes into power, he oversees the torture and persecution of thousands of members of an opposing tribe and goes on to become one of Africa's legendary dictators. The ending of this beautiful memoir is a fist to the stomach as Lauren realizes that she can be British or American, but she cannot be African. She can love it -- be willing to die for it -- but she cannot claimAfrica because she is white.",Hardcover,,269 pages,"

","The powerful true story of a heroic couple whose love for their country was matched only by their love for each other.  Mike and Kate Blaise fell in love during high school in small-town Macon, Missouri. Sharing a deep sense of patriotism, they both entered the U.S. Army—she as a commissioned officer and he as an enlisted infantry soldier who later became a helicopter pilot with the Air Cavalry. Forced to accept the realities of a military marriage yet determined to stay with her husband, Kate passed up her dream assignment in the United States to be with Mike, who was deployed to Korea. But they never imagined a day like 9/11 or the military aftermath that sent them to Iraq, where Mike would lose his life in combat.  A memoir unlike any other, The Heart of a Soldier captures the human side of war through the eyes of a unique insider. Delivering a candid take on life as a woman in the military as well as the grueling challenges facing all who serve, Kate Blaise takes us from the dreams of her idealistic youth to her final days with Mike, when she served in the battalion that provided support to his unit in Iraq. In vivid scenes, she describes her personal evolution as a female officer and a wife—and the incalculable price she and Mike paid in service to a country they love. Both a tribute and a work of riveting narrative, The Heart of a Soldier puts an unforgettable new face on love and war.  ""Kate Blaise reminds us that every war is, ultimately, a story of sacrifice and human tragedy. Kate's personal story -- and the sacrifice she made in Iraq -- humble us all.” —Andrew Exum, author of THIS MAN’S ARMY: A Soldier’s Story from the Front Lines of the War on Terrorism",Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Soldiers of Light and Love is an acclaimed study of the reform-minded northerners who taught freed slaves in the war-torn Reconstruction South. Jacqueline Jones's book, first published in 1980, focuses on the nearly three hundred women who served in Georgia in the chaotic decade following the Civil War. Commissioned by the American Missionary Association and other freedmen's aid societies, these middle-class New Englanders saw themselves as the postbellum, evangelical heirs of the abolitionist cause.Specific in compass, but wide-ranging in significance, Soldiers of Light and Love illuminates the complexity of class, race, and gender issues in early Victorian America.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","On August 7, 1969, when I and a half dozen other soldiers were cut off from other friendly forces and were nearly out of ammunition in a desperate fight with a much larger force of North Vietnamese regulars, I was not surprised to see Ross among the few who risked their lives to come to our assistance. Less than three months later Ross fell mortally wounded in still another battle. Karen [Epp's] work to document her brother's life and death is a unique effort that contributes to the full story of a long, controversial war that still has major impact on our country today. It is a tribute to not only Stan and Karen's family, but also to all veterans. Michael Lee Lanning Author of The Only War We Had: A Platoon Leader's Journal Of Vietnam and Vietnam, 1969-1970: ""A Commander's Journal"" My gratitude to my brother and those brave service men and women can never be expressed in words. Stan and those like him still live on in our hearts. His courage should inspire all of us to do a better job of living.

","Internationally acclaimed Martha Grimes once again turns her hand to crafting a story of such rich atmosphere and intricate suspense that she transports the reader to a world unlike any other.A once-fashionable, now fading resort hotel. A spinster Aunt living in an attic. Dirt roads that lead to dead ends.  A house full of secrets and old, dusty furnishings, uninhabited for almost half a century. A twelve-year-old girl with a passion for double-chocolate ice-cream sodas, and decaying lake-fronts, and an obsession with the death by drowning  of another young girl, forty years before.Like all important events in the past, there are repercussions and ramifications in the present. In the world as seen by Martha Grimes, those repercussions simmer and seethe and wind their way through hearts and souls. The ramifications can be subtle. Or exhilarating. Passionate. And they can also be deadly.        Hotel Paradise is a delicate yet excruciating view of the pettiness and cruelty of small town America. It is a look at the difficult decisions a young girl must make on her way to becoming an adult and the choices she must make between right and wrong, between love and truth, between life and death. It is a novel with extraordinary range and depth that ultimately becomes a thrilling morality play.With its narrative grace, its compelling characters, and its moment-to-moment suspense, Hotel Paradise is Martha Grimes at the top of her form.",Hardcover,,0 pages,"

","MUTTS is impossibly large. Its subject is the world, all living beings in it, and their relationship with each other. . . . Its touch is incredibly light and gentle, which explains how it alights in your mind and rests there. . . . The way that McDonnell's stories oscillate between gentle comedy and understated pathos is the strip's greatest strength.""""-Christopher Brayshaw, Vancouver ReviewAnimal lovers everywhere adore Patrick McDonnell's charming but pointed MUTTS. The strip strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted fun and social commentary-on the human condition as well as the animal world. The deceptively simple comic follows the adventures of Earl the dog and Mooch the cat, an unlikely best-friend team, and Shtinky Puddin', Sourpuss, Guard Dog, and Crabby. Patrick's distinctive cartooning style effectively relays the all-too-real concerns of his characters with entertaining, clever, laugh-out-loud banter.Infodad.com describes MUTTS as """"humane and funny and gentle and caring and heartfelt and-did we mention funny?"""" The site goes on to say that the strip """"includes enough hijinks and outstanding art (yes, art!) to please anyone with a taste for animals and amusement.""""",Paperback,,128 pages,"

","The fun and mischievous daily adventures of head mutt Earl and his kitty chum, Mooch, take center stage in Patrick McDonnell's Mutts collection, A Little Look-See. As with McDonnell's previous collections, the always-adorable Mooch and Earl can be counted on for hearty laughs and endearing moments as they share their pets'-eye views when ""their peoples"" are not around. In A Little Look-See, we learn through Earl and Mooch that yes, animals do practice those irresistible expressions that melt our hearts, and we witness a not-so-dignified debate over the age-old question of who is cuter: dogs or cats?The creative style and classic charm of Mutts earns McDonnell the admiration of loyal readers, prominent national organizations, and fellow cartoonists, as well as frequent comparisons to cartoon-strip greats such as Peanuts and Calvin and Hobbes. In 2000, McDonnell received the National Cartoonists Society's highest honor, the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for 1999. With a following that spans 20 countries, Mutts has also garnered notice internationally, winning Germany's prestigious Max & Moritz Award for best international comic strip.

","With its expressive art and humorous, often philosophical musings, Mutts has become one of the most popular comic strips in the world, with an estimated daily readership of 50 million. Peanuts creator Charles Schulz called Mutts one of the best comic strips of all time. Simpsons creator Matt Groening concurs: Mutts cheers me up every day. It's not only sweet, simple, and funnya rare combinationit's also the best drawn comic strip around. This comprehensive volume, the first to focus on the entire range of Patrick McDonnell's art, includes not only a vast collection of his Mutts strips, but also sketches, paintings, and wood carvings by the man who has made Earl the dog and Mooch the cat such beloved contemporary icons.McDonnell's textwhich serves as autobiography, comic history, character explication, and art history rolled into onelets readers into his private universe to observe his process, influences, and passions. The result is an intimate and revealing look at the complexities of the cartooning craft and the forces that drive his own creative endeavors. Author Bio: Patrick McDonnell illustrated the Russell Baker Sunday Observer column for the New York Times Magazine and Bad Baby, a monthly comic strip for Parents magazine, before creating Mutts in 1994. McDonnell has also been a regular contributor to Sports Illustrated, Reader's Digest, Time, and many other national magazines, is the coauthor of the Abrams book Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman, and is on the board of directors of the Humane Society of the United States. John Carlin has been a lawyer, college professor, art critic, music producer, and TV director. He is currently organizing a survey of 20th-century American comics, cartoons, and comic books for the Museum of Contemporary Art and the UCLA Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Cofounder of the media design and production company Funny Garbage, he is also founder and creative director of the Red Hot Organization, a not-for-profit music and video production company.",Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","In The Blue Last, Richard Jury finally faces the last thing in the world he wants to deal with—the war that killed his mother, his father, his childhood. Mickey Haggerty, a DCI with the London City police, has asked for Jury's help. Two skeletons have been unearthed in the City during the excavation of London's last bombsite, where once a pub stood called the The Blue Last. Mickey believes that a child who survived the bombing has been posing for over fifty years as a child who didn't. The grandchild of brewery magnet Oliver Tyndale supposedly survived that December 1940 bombing . . . but did she? Mickey also has a murder to solve. Simon Croft, prosperous City financial broker, and son of the one-time owner of The Blue Last is found shot to death in his Thames-side house. But the book he was writing about London during the German blitzkrieg has disappeared. Jury wants to get eyes and ears into Tynedale Lodge, and looks to his friend, Melrose Plant, to play the role. Reluctantly, Plant plays it, accompanied on his rounds of the Lodge gardens by nine-year-old Gemma Trim, orphan and ward of Oliver Tynedale; and Benny Keagan, a resourceful twelve-year-old orphaned delivery boy.And Richard Jury may not make it out alive.A stolen book, stolen lives, or is any of this what it seems? Identity, memory, provenance - these are all called into question in The Blue Last",Paperback,,446 pages,"

But weather frustrates their flight, and eventually thirty-seven of them were captured and condemned to burn at the stake in the Auto-de-Fe. In prose at once lyrical and suspenseful, Riera recreates the lives of Majorcan Jews in the seventeenth century--in a world of inquisitors, aristocrats, merchants, farmers, and soldiers--in a lush mosaic of history and period detail, religion and cultural lore.

With a nearly forgotten bravery, Billy confronts the monotony of his job in telephone sales, the awkward beauty of a desperate pickpocket named Penny Maple, and the seemingly impossible solution to the mystery of his sister's death.

","Many parents find it easier to talk to their children about sex and other intimate matters than to answer questions about God, prayer, good, and evil. In fact, parents may feel they don't know the answers to such questions for themselves, much less for their young children. In Teaching Your Children About God, Rabbi David Wolpe shows Jewish parents how to openly explore the idea of God with their children. Through poignant anecdotes and practical exercises, Wolpe teaches how parents can guide children in the practice of prayer and create an atmosphere in which children feel comfortable questioning and wondering about God, life, and death. Wolpe also offers invaluable insights into children's spiritual needs, reveals the powerful effect faith can have on a child's self-esteem, and enables parents to understand their children's fears, dreams, and hopes. Perhaps most important, this wise and potentially life-changing book shows parents who may feel something missing In their own spiritual lives that it is possible to nourish their own souls even as they nurture their children's.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","The intimate contemporary account of one man's quest is a valuable step-by-step approach that anyone can follow on the path of self-knowledge. During an interview with J. Krishnamurti in 1944 the author underwent a radical inner transformation, a turning about at the deepest seat of consciousness. The result: Now Consciousness, the perception of reality moment-to-moment, free of time and discrimination. This awareness leads to an inner clarity that enables the individual to objectively watch the intricacies of the thought process and explore the secrets of consciousness. Albert Blackburn's straightforward accounting of his own experiences make this work ideal for anyone interested in the dynamics of consciousness and the psychology of transpersonal experiencing. The author disputes the necessity of a linear approach to enlightenment; instead he suggests the possibility of a vertical, instantaneous breakthrough, free of time. Now Consciousness: Exploring the World Beyond Thought is a stimulating and perceptive account of Albert Blackburn's/the author's experience in transpersonal realms. The personal account of his time with Krishnamurti is especially interesting, and his treatment of the process of self-realization is -- to use a word the author may regard as inappropriate -- thoughtful.

","Rita Carter ponders the nature, origins, and purpose of consciousness in this fascinating inquiry into the toughest problem facing modern science and philosophy. Building on the foundation of her bestselling book Mapping the Mind, she considers whether consciousness is merely an illusion, a by-product of our brain's workings, some as yet inexplicable feature or property of the material universe or—as the latest physics may suggest—the very fundament of reality. Little, she discovers, is as it first seems.Carter draws from a solid body of knowledge—empirical findings and theoretical hypotheses--about consciousness, much of it derived from recent discoveries about the brain. Her lively, accessible narrative ranges widely over new ways of thinking about the subject and what direction new research is taking. Leading scholars from a range of perspectives provide topical essays that complement Carter's account. The book also discusses how traditional approaches—philosophical, scientific, and experiential—might be brought together to create a more complete understanding of consciousness.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Portals to Higher Consciousness introduces the reader to the various ways we can explore the spiritual domain. But . . . how can we explore Higher Consciousness? To answer that question, author Norman D. Livergood explains that exploring the spiritual domain requires that we actually enter into and participate in that reality, not merely read about it or think about it. We must be active investigators and experimenters in the world of the spirit, not merely sight-seers, scholars, or dilettantes. The book describes the process that serious students use to actually realize--bring to manifestation--their Higher Consciousness, ""through which they are able to contact Reality in a region of pure Truth. The beginning of this process is the realization 'that things are not what they seem.'"" If you're interested in investigating higher consciousness, put on your hiking clothes and join this spiritual expedition.",Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Renowned for being THE definitive source of homicide investigation, Practical Homicide Investigation: Tactics, Procedures, and Forensic Techniques is the recognized protocol used by investigative divisions of major police departments throughout the world. It is also the text used in most police academies, including the prestigious FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. It emphasizes essential procedures, combines detailed techniques with instructive case studies, and outlines the foundation on which to build a solid, prosecutable case. The fundamental criminal investigative techniques stressed in the Fourth Edition are crucial for effective inquiry into sudden and violent death. Eminent author, lecturer, consultant, and expert witness Vernon J. Geberth begins the book with a comprehensive discussion of homicide crime scenes. The book evolves chronologically from initial police notification, the correct police response that follows, and the subsequent steps necessary to conduct an intelligent investigation. It then delves into more technical aspects of homicide investigation, augmented with numerous pictures and full-color illustrations that involve pertinent case histories. The book features two new chapters along with major revisions of those from the previous edition. In addition it contains 675 photos and illustrations - including 300 new entries that incorporate depictions of wound structures and procedures that portray exactly what to do and how to do it. All illustrations are presented in full color, including new medical-legal drawings for instruction and courtroom testimony. Vernon Geberth was featured in an interview on News 14 Carolina in Fayetteville discussing his 3-day seminar on Practical Homicide Investigation.He also discusses the book in a video on the CRC Press YouTube channel.Vernon Geberth was recently interviewed for an article entitled, The Hunt for a Serial Killer: Revisting the Gilgo Beach Murders.",Hardcover,,999 pages,"

The increase in these violent crimes over the past decade has created an urgent need for more and better information about these men: their crime scene patterns, violent acts, and above all, their motivations for committing these shocking and repetitive murders.This authoritative book represents the data, findings, and implications of a long-term F.B.I.-sponsored study of serial sex killers. Specially trained F.B.I. agents examined thirty-six convicted, incarcerated sexual murderers to build a valuable new bank of information which reveals the world of the serial sexual killer in both quantitative and qualitative detail. Data was obtained from official psychiatric and criminal records, court transcripts, and prison reports, as well as from extensive interviews with the offenders themselves.Featured in this book is detailed information on the F.B.I.'s recently developed Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (VICAP) and a sample of an actual VICAP Crime Analysis Report Form.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","This study analyzes the impact of Spanish rule on Indian peasant identity in the late colonial period by investigating three areas of social behavior. Based on the criminal trial records and related documents from the regions of central Mexico and Oaxaca, it attempts to discover how peasants conceived of their role under Spanish rule, how they behaved under various kinds of street, and how they felt about their Spanish overlords.In examining the character of village uprisings, typical relationships between killers and the people they killed, and the drinking patterns of the late colonial period, the author finds no warrant for the familiar picture of sullen depredation and despair. Landed peasants of colonial Mexico drank moderately on the whole, and mostly on ritual occasions; they killed for personal and not political reasons. Only when new Spanish encroachments threatened their lands and livelihoods did their grievances flare up in rebellion, and these occasions were numerous but brief. The author bolsters his conclusions with illuminating comparisons with other peasant societies.",Paperback,,242 pages,"

","Is Iceland, universally perceived as a peaceful, idyllic nation, being threatened by an inevitable flood of crime as it enters the global community? In recent decades the Icelandic state has taken serious steps to curb mounting crime, establishing a specialized drug court and an undercover drug police agency. Public opinion polls clearly demonstrate Icelanders’ growing concern that crime and drug use are on the rise. In their provocative new book, Wayward Icelanders, Helgi Gunnlaugsson and John Galliher offer another, more nuanced explanation for recent Icelandic attitudes toward crime, one that takes into account the unique history and culture of this relatively homogeneous and isolated nation.Wayward Icelanders explores how the threat of crime has affected Icelanders’ collective self-identity, producing an ever greater need for social control. Historically Iceland has provided stiff sanctions for the use and abuse of mind-altering substances. Drunk driving has long been systematically punished, and even beer was prohibited for more than seventy years. The rate of conviction for these crimes is high, even in a democracy that prides itself on protecting civil liberties. Even more troubling, however, is the low rate of convictions for rape cases, which suggests that such crimes receive less attention from the state. Drawing on the classic work of Durkheim as well as Kai Erikson’s Wayward Puritans, Gunnlaugsson and Galliher demonstrate that an escalating war on crime can threaten freedom even in a small, affluent, and relatively nonviolent nation like Iceland with a long-standing commitment to democracy and individual rights.",Hardcover,,170 pages,"

Their action spans the whole world known to the Vikings, but the stories mainly center on the unique society they founded in Icleand, depicting the men and women who settled there and their descendants. For sheer narrative artistry and skill of characterization, the fiest Sagas rank with the world's greatest literary treasuresas epic as Homer, as deep in tragedy as Sophocles, as engagingly human as Shakespeare. The Sagas of the Icelanders form a unique literary genre and have served as a source of inspiration for many outstanding writers of later timessuch diverse authors as Walter Scott, Jorge Lius Borges and W.H. Auden.Deeply rooted in the real world of their day, concise and straightforward in style, the Sagas explore perennial human problems and conflucts: love and hate, fate and freedom, honor and feud, crime and punishment, travel and exile. In saga narrative we may identify the budding of a literary technique that, centuries later, would develop into the great European novel. While steeped in the spirit of Viking age oral tradition, the Sagas tell of the lives and deeds of Icelanders during the decades immediately before and after the year 1000, when they abandoned the Germanic gods such as Odin and Thor and adopted Christianity. In this period, too, Icelanders ventured farther westwards, to explore and settle Greenland; the culmination of this venture was Leif Eiriksson's voyage to North America.Despite their traditional origins, the Sagas are first and foremost works of consciously created literary art. They are also, in a sense, frontier literature, in which the descendants of settlers reflect on their writers, the origins, identity, legends and myths, whilst grappling with troublesome contemporary realitites, not least a 13th century civil war. For the saga writers, the settlement period was something of a Golden Age, the era of a unique commonwealth of free chieftains with no king, dominated by Viking traditions of honor and blood vengeance.The Sagas of the Icelanders are not typical heroic literature, but rather stories of flesh-and-blood humans burdened with a heroic legacy. These were steely-minded men and domineering women in search of worldly wealth and power, fame and love. Typically, a feud could start with a minor slight to a man's honor and escalate into a chain of revenge and counter-revenge, culminating in a major battle or in the heroic death of a great champion. For the modern Saga reader, it is the psychological intensity and depth of the characters as much as the codes of honor and ethics which capture the imagination. And though strong men dominate teh Saga stage, it is often clever and beautiful women who manipulate the course of events behind the scenes and outspokenly voice their opinions on the players involved in it.The horizons of the saga writers extended to the limits of the Viking world: westward to Greenland and Vinland, east to Russia and north to Lappland, south and east to Constantinople and Jerusalem. Iclenaders and other Vikings sailed to the shores of Ireland, upriver to the cities of Rouen and London, all along the Baltic coast. Everywhere we see that the world lies at the feet of saga heroes: witty poets become the companions of kings and earls, fierce and successful fighters never lack the attentions of noble ladies. But though these champions reign victorious on foreign shores they almost always turn their backs on the honors heaped upon them, in order to return home to their Icelandic farms nestled under towering mountains in lonly fjords and valleys.If the Sagas can be compared to novels, the Tales are the medieval equivalent of short stories. Their narrative may have a smaller scale, but there is no loss of dramatic force, humor or deftness of character protrayal. Preserved either as independent narratives or as parts of larger works, most Tales tell of young Icelanders journeying abroad where they have a variety of encounters with men of power and influence. Their journeys represent a kind of rite of passage which tests the mettle of a potential hero. Tales range from brief anecdotes, sketched with a few masterful narrative strokes and terse dialogue, to light-hearted comedies in which royalty is gently mocked.In The Complete Sagas of the Icelanders, the Sagas and Tales have been grouped on broad thematic principles and divided accordingly among the five volumes of the set. Although overlapping is inevitable in a genre of such diversity, a central distinction can be established between Biogrpahies and Sagas of Feuds. The Biographies tell of exceptional individualspoets, outlaws and championsand the stories spotlight these ""odd men out"" as they pit their strength against a society they stand out from and defy. At the heart of the Sagas of Feuds are wealth, power, regional status, and the inevitable conflicts that result from life in a singular society which sets its own laws and metes out a hard justice. Each of the five volumes, then, is thematically self-contained and offers a particular angle of approach for exploring and navigating the vast and fascinating world of the sagas.",Hardcover,,2313 pages,"

","During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of Icelanders emigrated to both North and South America. Although the best known Icelandic settlements were in southern Manitoba, in the area that became known as “New Iceland,” Icelanders also established important settlements in Brazil, Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin, Washington, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia. Earlier accounts of this immigration have tended to concentrate on the history of New Iceland.     Using letters, Icelandic and English periodicals and newspapers, census reports, and archival repositories, Jonas Thor expands this view by looking at Icelandic immigration from a continent-wide perspective. Illustrated with maps and photographs, this book is a detailed social history of the Icelanders in North America, from the first settlement in Utah to the struggle in New Iceland.",Paperback,,306 pages,"

","From Narnia to Space Odyssey is the dialogue of letters between Arthur C. Clarke and C.S. Lewis in which they debate, discuss, and ponder the potential and potential dangers of the rise of technology. Their encounter sets the stage for much of what we face today: is technology the ""beauty"" that will lead to a more utopian society, or is it the ""beast"" that endangers our humanity and spirit? Clarke and Lewis began their correspondence in December 1943 when Clarke took Lewis to task for his remark about ""little rocket societies bent on exporting the crimes of mankind to other planets."" While they met only once (at a well-known pub in Oxford, with Lewis bringing along a good friend-the Oxford don, one J.R.R. Tolkien), their ""encounters"" lasted until 1954 when Clarke became involved in underwater exploration and left for the Great Barrier Reef. Their concern about the future of society, even from differing perspectives, is both provocative and illuminating, and bears close reading today when we are all confronted with the question whether mankind can control the explosion of technology or will become its slave.",Hardcover,,175 pages,"

","Used by C.S. Lewis himself, the term ""scientifiction"" is revived here as it once encompassed not only what we call science fiction, but also that indeterminate field of the 1940s and 1950s sometimes referred to as science fantasy (leading up to Ray Bradbury), along with a portion of that great realm that has come, since the advent of The Lord of the Rings,  to be called fantasy. Rather as an eighteenth-century novel may pre-date the divide between novel and romance, so C.S. Lewis's ""interplanetary"" novels may be considered to pre-date the modern divide between fantasy and science fiction and thus be thought of as ""scientifictional"" in nature. The stories dealt with are those in which Elwin Ransom is a character, the three usually called the ""space trilogy"" Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra,  and That Hideous Strength--and the time-fragment entitled The Dark Tower. Lengthy chapters are devoted to each of the four Ransom stories. The book presents a study of Lewis, the nature of science fiction, the nature of Lewis's ""Arcadian"" science fiction and his (and its) place in English literary history.",Paperback,,194 pages,"

","Written during the dark hours immediately before and during World War II, C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy, of which That Hideous Strength is the third and final volume, stands alongside such works as Albert Camus's The Plague and George Orwell's 1984 as a timely parable that has become timeless, beloved by succeeding generations as much for the sheer wonder of its storytelling as for the significance of its moral concerns.The final book in C. S. Lewis's acclaimed Space Trilogy, which includes Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra, That Hideous Strength concludes the adventures of the matchless Dr. Ransom. The dark forces that were repulsed in Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra are massed for an assault on the planet Earth itself. Word is on the wind that the mighty wizard Merlin has come back to the land of the living after many centuries, holding the key to ultimate power for that force which can find him and bend him to its will. A sinister technocratic organization is gaining power throughout Europe with a plan to ""recondition"" society, and it is up to Ransom and his friends to squelch this threat by applying age-old wisdom to a new universe dominated by science. The two groups struggle to a climactic resolution that brings the Space Trilogy to a magnificent, crashing close.",Paperback,,380 pages,"

","Idel's thesis is that the role of the golem concept in Judaism was to confer an exceptional status to the Jewish elite by bestowing it with the capability of supernatural powers deriving from a profound knowledge of the Hebrew language and its magical and mystical values. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of the whole range of material dealing with creation of the golem beginning with late antiquity and ending with the modern time. The author explores the relationship between these discussions and their historical and intellectual frameworks. Since there was in the medieval period a variety of traditions concerning the golem, it is plausible to assume that the techniques for creating this creature developed much earlier. This presentation focuses on the precise techniques for creating an artificial human, an issue previously neglected in the literature. A complete survey of the conceptions of the golem in North European and Spanish literature in medieval time allows not only a better understanding of this phenomenon, but also of the history of Jewish magic and mysticism in the Middle Ages. The Jewish and Christian treatments of the golem in the renaissance are explored as part of the renaissance concern for human nature.

As the Stranger in the story asserts, ""nothing exists; all is a dream.""",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","""Six years after Mark Twain's death, Albert Bigelow Paine, the author's literary executor, brought out a bowdlerized edition of The Mysterious Stranger, patched together from three unfinished manuscripts."" Gibson's edition, first published in 1969 and now back in print, presented the manuscripts for the fist time exactly as Mark Twain wrote them. Here the reader is offered a glimpse of Mark Twain's sustained creative process, in what many critics consider the finest fiction of his later years. Begun in 1897 and revised first in 1902 and then 1908, the third version was the only manuscript titled The Mysterious Stranger. These texts offer a rare opportunity to observe Mark Twain's sustained literary struggle with a central theme.",Paperback,,493 pages,"

","Annie Henry is finding out that being the governor's daughter in colonial Virginia is not the best way to spend one of the most important years of your life. Annie's father, the great American patriot Patrick Henry, has been elected governor of Virginia. And that means 12-year-old Annie has a new home--the governor's mansion in Williamsburg. Most girls would be thrilled with the excitement of such a position and the big-city life that comes with it. But to Annie, those things seem like more trouble than they're worth.There's a scary stranger who keeps bothering her, simply because her dad is "" important."" And people in the capital city expect a politician's daughter to act a certain way. Even her new school is very different than what she's used to.All in all, having to live in a strange place, apart from her old friends, is a little frightening to Annie. Especially when she realizes that as she's changing, she's growing apart from her father and feeling more and more like God is far away too.Should she tell anyone about what's going on--and about the mysterious man who just won't leave her alone? Or is dealing with problems by herself part of what it means to "" grow up"" ?In this third book of the Adventures of the American Revolution series, Susan Olasky gives 8- to 12-year-olds an exciting look at life in the colonies during the time of America's War of Independence.",Paperback,,144 pages,"

","Delve into The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, The Scarlet Letter, a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear a scarlet ""A"" on her clothing. She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, arrives at the exact moment of her deepest public shaming and vows to get revenge. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt. Though originally published in 1850, the story is set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In The Scarlet Letter, he created a story that highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.Complete and unabridged, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.",Paperback,Wordsworth Classics,197 pages,"

","Delve into The Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne's meditation on human alienation and its effect on the soul in this story set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts and be dazzled by literature. In Nathaniel Hawthorne's dark novel, The Scarlet Letter, a single sinful act ruins the lives of three people. None more so than Hester Prynne, a young, beautiful, and dignified woman, who conceived a child out of wedlock and receives the public punishment of having to always wear a scarlet ""A"" on her clothing. She refuses to reveal the father of her child, which could lighten her sentence. Her husband, the aptly-named Roger Chillingworth, who Hester thought had died in a shipwreck but was actually being held captive by Native Americans, arrives at the exact moment of her deepest public shaming and vows to get revenge. Her lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, remains safely unidentified, but is wracked with guilt. Though originally published in 1850, the story is set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts among Hawthorne's Puritan ancestors. In The Scarlet Letter, he created a story that highlighted both their weaknesses and their strengths. His knowledge of their beliefs and his admiration for their way of life was balanced by his concerns about their rigid and oppressive rules.Complete and unabridged, this elegantly designed, clothbound edition features an elastic closure and a new introduction by Mike Lee Davis.",Mass Market Paperback,,256 pages,"

","David O. Selznick was a unique figure in the golden Hollywood studio era. He produced some of the greatest and most memorable American films ever made--notably, Rebecca, A Star Is Born, Anna Karenina, A Farewell to Arms, and, above all, Gone With the Wind. Selznick's absolute power and artistic control are evidenced in his impassioned, eloquent, witty, and sometimes rageful memos to directors, writers, stars and studio executives, writings that have become almost as famous as his films. Newsweek wrote, I can't imagine how a book on the American movie business could be more illuminating, more riveting or more fun to read than this collection of David Selznick's memos.",Paperback,,632 pages,"

Lovecraft was a brilliant epistolarian whose effortlessly erudite correspondence created lasting friendships among many individuals whom he would never meet in person, including August Derleth, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber, Robert Bloch, C.L. Moore, and countless others. The unlimited extent of Lovecraft's intellectual curiosity is accurately preserved in this illustrated edition, in letters dealing with details of autobiography, fantastic literature, philosophical speculation, dreams and fancies, social commentary, and innumerable other subjects, ranging from the history and vestiges of colonial New England to the outermost abysses of the universe, beyond known space and conjectured time. Cosmic mythmaker, antiquarian recluse, philosophic materialist -- here are the most memorable epistolary writings by this extraordinary gentleman from Providence, who in the years since his death has become a legend.",Hardcover,,436 pages,"

As with Chris Ware’s selections for his best-selling McSweeney’s anthology, Brunetti’s choices make for a highly personal book (“my criteria were simple: these are comics that I savor and often revisit”) that serves as a broad historical overview of the medium and a round-up of some of today’s best and most interesting North American comic artists. Included here are works from such well-known artists as Robert Crumb, Kim Deitch, Art Spiegelman, Chris Ware, Ben Katchor, Charles Burns, Gary Panter, Seth, Phoebe Gloeckner, Daniel Clowes, Lynda Barry, Joe Sacco, and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, as well as many other pioneers whose names may be less familiar.Brunetti offers selections from the works of more than seventy-five avant-garde comic artists.  His selections are arranged by genre and grouped thematically. Luxuriously produced and printed in four-color throughout, the book is a must-have for collectors, aficionados, readers of comics, and those generally interested in cutting-edge art and literature.",Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","Every year, over one million children have to endure the divorce of their parents. Through her involvement with the Kid's Turn program, author Mary Ellen Hannibal has discovered that the key to helping children cope with divorce is through their expressive selves, but listening and responding productively to kids is hard when parents are embroiled in one of the most difficult passages of their own lives. Using stories of actual kids in their everyday settings and the highly developed techniques of the Kid's Turn organization, Hannibal teaches parents how to recognize, cultivate, and respond to their child's feelings, thus helping the child through the parents' divorce. Much has been made of the negative effects of divorce on children's overall development and future success as mature adults, but Good Parenting Through Your Divorce proves that parents can develop the skills they need to make their children's transition a healthy and successful one.-- Kid's Turn is a nationally recognized program based in San Francisco -- featured on ABC's 20/20 and NPR -- that has been giving workshops to parents and children undergoing divorce for over ten years-- Children who live through divorce have a more difficult time finishing school, working productively, and establishing their own longlasting relationships-- Addresses the emotional strategies for better co-parenting and gives practical guidance for sharing custody",Paperback,,304 pages,"

Their author, who saw action in the Civil War, became an avid student of ancient military conflicts and the traditions of leadership that developed from those conflicts. Dodge introduces six great military leaders, each one in command of his country#39;s destiny. Beginning with Alexander the Great, and proceeding to Hannibal and Julius Caesar, he blends his own knowledge of military strategy with that of the ancient chroniclers. He then moves on to discuss the three outstanding military minds of the modern period: Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and Gustavus Adolphus. Illustrated with maps of battle sites, this book provides readers with an informative guide to the military genius of six gifted soldiers.",Hardcover,,219 pages,"

The struggle with Rome for domination of the Mediterranean has left the Carthaginians with shrinking provincial territories and increasing tributes to their merciless northern enemies... the Romans. The famed Carthaginian General Hamilcar Barca has sworn to never give in to these conquerors... and to destroy Rome at all costs. His eldest son, Hannibal, shall be his weapon. At the age of nine, Hannibal is torn from his tight circle of brothers and whisked away to study the strategies of warfare with his father in the distant land of Hispania. And over the next twenty years, a warrior is fashioned... a warrior is born. Two men in history brought the Roman Empire to their knees. One was the son of a carpenter. The other was the son of Hamilcar. This is the story of the greatest military strategist that ever lived... Hannibal.",Paperback,Second,230 pages,"

","A collection of early and not-so-early work by the mistress of gut-level fiction-making.You can say I write stories with sex and violence and therefore my writing isn't worth considering because it uses content much less lots of content. Well, I tell you this: 'Prickly race, who know nothing except how to eat out your hearts with envy, you don't eat cunt'... Edited by Sylvere Lotringer and published in 1991, this handy, pocket-sized collection of some early and not-so-early work by the mistress of gut-level fiction-making, Hannibal Lecter, My Father gathers together Acker's raw, brilliant, emotional and cerebral texts from 1970s, including the self-published 'zines written under the nom-de-plume, The Black Tarantula. This volume features, among others, the full text of Acker's opera, The Birth of the Poet, produced at Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1985, Algeria, 1979 and fragments of Politics, written at the age of 21. Also included is the longest and definitive interview Acker ever gave over two years: a chatty, intriguing and delightfully self-deprecating conversation with Semiotext(e) editor Sylvere Lotringer--which is trippy enough in itself as Lotringer, besides being a real person, has appeared as a character in Acker's fiction. And last, but not least, is the full transcript of the decision reached by West Germany's Federal Inspection Office for Publications Harmful to Minors in which Acker's work was judged to be ""not only youth-threatening but also dangerous to adults,"" and subsequently banned. Acker is the sort of the writer that should be read first at 16, so that you can spend the rest of your life trying to figure her out; she confuses, infuriates, perplexes and then all of a sudden the writing seems to be in your bloodstream, like some kind of benign virus. She's definitely not for the easily offended--but then, there are worse things in life than being offended. Such as the things that Acker writes about...",Paperback,,148 pages,"

","This is an historical biography of Hannibal, the military leader of Carthage responsible for waging a dramatic onslaught on Rome during the Punic Wars. One of the few generals of history to be famous for the war he lost, Hannibal's attack in 218BC - which included his renowned march of elephants across the Alps - ranks amongst the most courageous and ill-fated enterprises in the history of the ancient world. This definitive biography of one of the most fascinating figures of ancient history offers a fresh perspective on the demise of the Hellenistic world and the rise of Rome.",Paperback,,243 pages,"

","Years after his escape, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's Inferno. Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.",Paperback,,541 pages,"

","The Normans originally came to Italy and Sicily in the 11th and 12th centuries looking for adventure or a livelihood, but once there, found opportunity for fame and fortune. The story of the Norman conquest in Italy and Sicily is indeed one of knights and adventurers, great battles and lowly pillage, opportunism and statesmanship, and crusade and coexistence. This rich and often dramatic study focuses on the eight sons of Tancred of Hauteville, especially Robert Guiscard, who has been called ""the most dazzling military ruler between Julius Caesar and Napoleon,"" and his youngest brother Roger, who conquered Sicily. It discusses how they expanded their lands throughout southern Italy, and then took Sicily from its Muslim rulers. The brothers, often in conflict with each other, challenged both the Papacy and the Byzantine Empire, became the main supporters of the reformed Papacy, and founded a rich, sophisticated kingdom that lasted until the nineteenth century.",Paperback,,222 pages,"

R. Allen Brown traces the forces and influences that shaped both England and Normandy in the decades before 1066, and shows how the new order, emerging from the aftermath of the battle of Hastings, produced a degree of political unity and social dynamism previously unknown in England, bringing a reinvigorated nation fully into the mainstream of the dynamic expansion of western Latin Christendom.R.

","In the Middle Ages writers were still deeply involved in the legal and linguistic consequences of the Norman victory. Later, the issues became directly relevant to debates about constitutional rights; the theory of a ""Norman yoke"" provided first a call for revolution and, by the nineteenth century, a romantic vision of a lost Saxon paradise. When history became a subject for academic study, controversies still raged around such subjects as Saxon versus Norman institutions. The debates are still going on. Interest has now moved to such subjects as peoples and races, frontier societies, women's studies and colonialism.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","“Before I turn 67, I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like.” This inspired personal ad from Jane Juska drew tremendous response and swept the retired teacher into a whirlwind existence she barely recognized as her own. She relayed her fun and frank exploits in the bestseller A Round-Heeled Woman. Now Juska continues her astonishing story in this much anticipated new adventure.Five years after that fateful ad, Juska has become a friend and confessor for women of all ages who confide in her their poignant, tragic, or blissful stories– unaccompanied women who are alone for now, but ever searching for intimacy. And in spite of Juska’s own success, “unaccompanied” is a description that applies to her as well. She’s still looking for a man to keep her company–not a husband, not even a partner, but simply the perfect lover, once described by Katharine Hepburn as one who “lives nearby and visits often.”Unaccompanied Women embraces not only Juska’s continuing explorations of Eros (note to fans: her younger lover, Graham, is still on the scene) but also a blossoming literary career that catapults her from San Francisco to New York, London, and Paris. At book signings, earnest men place themselves purposely at the end of the line in order to engage her in private conversations, while women linger to confess their own erotic longings and their experiences with the good, the bad, and even the ugly. All the while, Juska is coping with the unnerving possibility of losing her home, a tiny cottage in Berkeley, California–and so her search broadens and intensifies, not just for love, friendship, and sex but also for enough money to keep a roof over her head. Jane Juska shares all this richness of living in a poignant and humorous exploration of emotional terrain rarely discussed in our society. This wise and warmhearted book provides vivid evidence that the pursuit of pleasure and lasting relationships is not just for the young, but also for the young at heart.From the Hardcover edition.",Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","In a world where natural disasters have created hardship and social unrest, a breakthrough in medical science brings about a ray of hope.Scientists learn how to manipulate the DNA strands to obliterate genetic disorders, and also to beautify. Those who can afford it rush to correct weight problems, difficult hair, eye colour, more pleasing body shapes, and so on. Those who can't afford the services are disgruntled, until they discover these things are covered by social medicine ... so are actually available to all. The improvements the government makes in living conditions, and the preoccupation with the 'new toy' calms the waters. Things become pleasantly peaceful once more ... and then unnervingly peaceful. Whispers begin to circulate that people are being replaced. Lena dismisses it ... at least, at first. When a man well known to her, an anarchist, seems to make an abrupt 360 degree turn in his politics, though, she becomes seriously alarmed. Nigel, her older brother, a tech for a genetics lab, dismisses her concerns, and Lena is almost convinced ... until she comes face to face with the assassin sent to silence her. Imprisoned, the handsome, golden haired rebel known as Dax, may be Lena's only hope of salvation, but can she trust that his agenda is the same as her own? If someone is replacing people with controllable replicas of themselves, how can you ever be sure that anyone, is who you think they are?Rating: 18 yrs+: graphic violence, graphic sex, explicit language, and profanity.",Paperback,,200 pages,"

","Many people believe that cats do not have an emotional life, that they are cold and indifferent. Jeffrey Masson, author of several bestselling books about animal emotions, including When Elephants Weep and Dogs Never Lie About Love, is convinced that, on the contrary, cats are almost pure emotion. Masson lives by the sea in New Zealand with five cats, and in this fascinating, immensely readable book he reports on his close observations of their emotional lives. These he divides into nine categories - Narcissism, Love, Contentment, Attachment, Jealousy, Fear, Anger, Curiosity and Playfulness - and to each of which he devotes a chapter. Masson's bond with his cats is extraordinary - they accompany him every night on his evening walk along the shore - and he believes that with no other animal is it easier and more enchanting to cross the species barrier.",Paperback,,,"

Drawing from literature, history, animal behavioral research, and the wonderful true stories of cat experts and cat lovers around the world, Jeffrey Masson vividly explores the delights and mysteries of the feline heart. But at the core of this remarkable book are Masson's candid, often amusing observations of his own five cats. Their mischievousness, aloofness, and affection provide a way to examine emotions from contentment to jealousy, from anger to love. Consider the question: Are cats selfish? While human egocentricity is defined by how little a person cares about others, the cat's narcissism is not like that at all. Cats may appear self-centered, but they watch us all the time, taking us in. They see us; they notice us a far cry from vanity.Cats are curious, a trait that rarely kills them. On the contrary, it gives them the chance to assess, in their own idiosyncratic way, whether we are worthy of their attention. Cats are happy to be themselves. What they think of us is a different question entirely. We need cats to need us, notes Masson, It unnerves us that they do not. However, if they do not need us, they nonetheless seem to love us. The Nine Emotional Lives of Cats will captivate readers with its surprises and insights, offering a new perspective on the deep connection shared by humans and their feline friends. This is the book that Masson's many fans and cat lovers everywhere have been waiting for.From the Hardcover edition.",Audio Cassette,unabridged,0 pages,"

","The Diviners is the culmination and completion of Margaret Laurence's Manawaka cycle.This is the powerful story of an independent woman who refuses to abandon her search for love. For Morag Gunn, growing up in a small Canadian prairie town is a toughening process – putting distance between herself and a world that wanted no part of her. But in time, the aloneness that had once been forced upon her becomes a precious right – relinquished only in her overwhelming need for love. Again and again, Morag is forced to test her strength against the world – and finally achieves the life she had determined would be hers.The Diviners has been acclaimed by many critics as the outstanding achievement of Margaret Laurence’s writing career. In Morag Gunn, Laurence has created a figure whose experience emerges as that of all dispossessed people in search of their birthright, and one who survives as an inspirational symbol of courage and endurance.The Diviners received the Governor General’s Award for Fiction for 1974.",Paperback,,390 pages,"

","No other word in the English language is more endemic to contemporary Black American culture and identity than ""Soul."" Since the 1960s Soul has been frequently used to market and sell music, food, and fashion. However, Soul also refers to a pervasive belief in the capacity of the Black body/spirit to endure the most trying of times in an ongoing struggle for freedom and equality. While some attention has been given to various genre manifestations of Soul-as in Soul music and food-no book has yet fully explored the discursive terrain signified by the term. In this broad-ranging, free-spirited book, a diverse group of writers, artists, and scholars reflect on the ubiquitous but elusive concept of Soul. Topics include: politics and fashion, Blaxploitation films, language, literature, dance, James Brown, and Schoolhouse Rock. Among the contributors are Angela Davis, Manning Marable, Paul Gilroy, Lyle Ashton Harris, Michelle Wallace, Ishmael Reed, Greg Tate, Manthia Diawara, and dream hampton.",Hardcover,,,"

","""Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.""These are the famous opening words of a treatise that has not ceased to stir vigorous debate since its first publication in 1762. Rejecting the view that anyone has a natural right to wield authority over others, Rousseau argues instead for a pact, or ‘social contract’, that should exist between all the citizens of a state and that should be the source of sovereign power. From this fundamental premise, he goes on to consider issues of liberty and law, freedom and justice, arriving at a view of society that has seemed to some a blueprint for totalitarianism, to others a declaration of democratic principles.",Paperback,,168 pages,"

Here are two dark and dazzling classic tales of passion and peril by the incomparable mistress of romantic suspense, #1 New York Times bestselling authorNora RobertsHer voice was like hot whiskey, smooth and potent, but it was her contradictions that fascinated Detective Boyd Fletcher - the vulnerability beneath her self-sufficient facade. Radio announcer Cilla O'Roarke was being threatened, and it was Boyd's job to protect her. But though she protested his intrusion into her life, an undeniable attraction sizzled between them...and anything could happen on the Night Shift.He walked the night, a shadow among shadows. They called him Nemesis and he was everywhere. But the night he saved Deborah O'Roarke from an attacker he rediscovered the sweet ache of longing. As Gage Guthrie he could woo her.

","Consummate master of his craft, Stephen King has kept millions awake past midnight shivering at tales that probe the shadows and reveal the dark side. Now listeners can chill to this second dramatic unabridged production of short stories from his best selling book, Night Shift. It brings Stephen King's demonic stories fully to life - and the terror even closer to home. Dropout drifter Hall has crossed the country doing whatever comes his way. Working the ""Graveyard Shift"" in a decaying Massachusetts mill under a bullying foreman is just one more leg in his crazy quilt journey, until it leads to a nether realm where the Rat Queen defends her empire. Things are never as they seem, as ""The Man Who Loved Flowers"" proves one perfect Spring evening on the sidewalks of New York. In ""The Last Rung on the Ladder"" beautiful Kitty hangs from dizzying heights above a hideous fate and, in ""Night Surf,"" a group of teenagers on a late summer beach watch the world end in a gruesome, viral whimper. The mind-numbing secrets of ""Jerusalem's Lot"" wait in an ancestral mansion where blood binds the Boone family to a timeless history of unspeakable evil.",Audio Cassette,,0 pages,"

","In ""Raising The Dead,"" A.J.Stirland uses archaeological and skeletal evidence to give the reader a welcome insight into the lives of the mariners and soldiers of the Mary Rose, King Henry VIII's favourite warship before she sank in 1545. This book examines the building, sinking and raising of the Mary Rose and her historical context before moving on to the examination of what the remains of the crew can reveal to us about fighting men of that period, from their ages and height to their health, diet and physical condition.  This is the first book to deal with the men who made up the crew of the Mary Rose. It provides an exciting glimpse of Tudor life and the Tudor navy, relating archaeological findings to existing documentary evidence, opening a fascinating window into one of Henry VIII's Great Ships and a frozen moment of sixteenth-century time.",Hardcover,,204 pages,"

","This is the fascinating true story of a Japanese boy's growing disillusionment with the conduct of a patriotic war.Boy H's father was a tailor, his mother a tambourine-banging Christian in a country of very few Christians. His childhood unfolded in the 1930s, when militarism was steadily strengthening its grip on Japan; it ended when the nation lay in ruins. What set H apart from other kids, despite the shared preoccupation with schoolmates, movies, and sex, was an unusually sharp eye and a precociously skeptical attitude that made him a bit of a loner in a conformist society.Though at times dark, his anecdotes are arranged with the lightest of touches and a sharp sense of humor. The total effect is of a rich, varied, and intensely readable novel, but one that involves real lives, actual events.",Paperback,,528 pages,"

He wore baby shoes on his tiny feet and was unable to walk without holding his mother's hand. His colour was dark yet pasty and his face horribly misshapen. The child was being ravaged by thalassemia, a life-threatening inherited disease of the blood, and one of the leading causes of disfigurement, disability and death in children worldwide.

","It is 48 B.C. For years now, the rival Roman generals Caesar and Pompey have engaged in a contest for world domination. Both now turn to Egypt, where Pompey plans a last desperate stand on the banks of the Nile, while Caesar's legendary encounter with queen Cleopatra will spark a romance that reverberates down the centuries. But Egypt is a treacherous land, torn apart by the murderous rivalry between the goddess-queen and her brother King Ptolemy.Into this hot-house atmosphere of intrigue and deception comes Gordianus the Finder, innocently seeking a cure for his wife Bethesda in the sacred waters of the Nile. But when his plans go awry, he finds himself engaged in an even more desperate pursuit - to prove the innocence of the son he once disowned, who stands accused of murder.The judgment of Caesar will determine the fate of Gordianus's son; the choice Caesar makes between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy will determine the future of Rome's empire. At the center of these two dilemmas, Gordianus becomes the unwitting fulcrum that will shift the balance of history. Witness to the death throes of the old world, he is to play a critical role in the birth of the world to come.Drawing scrupulously on historical sources, this is the most ambitious novel yet in Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series. Saylor presents a bold new vision of Caesar and paints a compelling and original portrait of Cleopatra, amid bloodshed, battles and storms, in a setting of Egyptian magic and mystery.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Using scholarly, historical insight, and evocative storytelling that brings to life the glories of ancient Rome, Steven Saylor takes the reader from the bloody lines of clashing Roman armies to the backrooms of the Senate floor, where power-hungry politicians wrestle the Fates for control of Rome's destiny. With the consular election drawing near, Rome is fiercely divided between the conservative Cicero and the tempestuous Catilina, whose followers are rumored to be plotting a blood-thirsty siege for power if their leader fails to win office.Gordianus the Finder, retired to his Etruscan farm, is happy to be free of the intrigue and danger of the capital, but when his old friend Cicero enlists the Finder in an elaborate plot to control Catilina, Gordianus is drawn back into a familiar world. Now caught in a cloak-and-dagger political struggle for the fate of the Republic, Gordianus finds himself strangely drawn to the controversial candidate. Is Catilina really a subversive renegade, or are Cicero suspicions part of an even greater conspiracy? When a headless corpse ominously appears on his farm, Gordianus knows he must unlock the secret of Catilina's Riddle before Rome tears herself apart.",Paperback,,496 pages,"

","In this mystery set in Marseilles in 49 B.C., master detective Gordianus the Finder is on a personal quest to learn the truth about his missing son, Meto. Plunged into the midst of the bloody Roman civil war, the well-connected Gordianus and his son-in-law Davus survive adventure after adventure as they penetrate the Gaulic city Massilia, which is walled against Roman invasion. From the first pages, author Steven Saylor is on sure ground with his distinguished protagonist. Gordianus's careful, thoughtful musings are infused with real pathos as he seeks out information about his son whom, he has been informed, is dead. There is some speculation that Meto betrayed Caesar and that death was his punishment. Lacking a corpse, Gordianus cannot bring himself to believe that Meto is really dead.Indeed, bonds between fathers and children—their betrayals, promises, and legacies—play a key role in the twisting plot of Last Seen in Massilia. Literally the title refers to Meto, but the motif extends to other key characters as well. Apollonides, the imperious ruler of Massilia, has a peculiar bond with his horribly deformed daughter. The city's ""scapegoat"", Hieronymus, lives out the legacy of his parents' illegal double suicide by being the human repositor of Massilia's collective sins. He is expected to hurl himself from Sacrifice Rock to appease vengeful gods.Sacrifice Rock is central to the book, the site of a tussle between man and woman that ends, provocatively, in the woman's death. Was it suicide or murder? The three witnesses—Gordianus, Davus, and Hieronymus—are sharply divided on exactly what they saw. Gordianus pursues the truth of this mystery almost as a diversion from the more compelling mystery of his son's disappearance.",Paperback,,300 pages,"

","In the year 48 B.C., Rome is in the midst of civil war. As Pompey the Great and Julius Caesar fight for control of the Republic, Rome itself becomes a hotbed of intrigue, riven by espionage, greedy profiteering, and bitter betrayals...Against this background a beautiful young seeress staggers across the Roman marketplace and dies in the arms of Gordianus the Finder. Possibly mad and claiming no memory of her past, Cassandra—like her Trojan namesake—was reputed to possess the gift of prophecy. For such a gift there are many in Rome who would pay handsomely—or resort to murder.Obsessed with Cassandra and her mystery, Gordianus begins to investigate her murder. As he gradually peels away the veils of secrecy that surround Cassandra's life and death, he discovers a web of conspiracy linking many of the city's most ruthless and powerful women. Now Gordianus's pursuit of the truth not only endangers his own life, but could change the future of Rome itself.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

In the unseasonable heat of a spring morning in 80 B.C., Gordianus the Finder is summoned to the house of Cicero, a young advocate staking his reputation on this case. The charge is patricide; the motive, a son's greed. The punishment, rooted deep in Roman tradition, is horrific beyond imagining.Gordianus's investigation takes him through the city's raucous, pungent streets and deep into urban Umbria, unraveling layers of deceit, twisted passions, and murderous desperation.

","Best known for his acclaimed mystery fiction set in ancient Rome, in A TWIST AT THE END Steven Saylor delivers a stunning historical novel about America’s first recorded serial murders—the Austin, Texas servant girl murders of 1885—artfully blending real characters and true crime into an engrossing work of fiction.  The city of Austin, Texas, “is fearfully dull,” wrote young Will Porter to a friend in the spring of 1885, “except for the frequent raids of the Servant Girl Annihilators, who make things lively in the dead of night.”  Years later, Will Porter would become the most famous writer in America— O. Henry, the toast of New York. The long-ago Austin servant girl murders would remain unsolved. But behind the O. Henry pen name, Will Porter was a man with secrets. The appearance of a merciless blackmailer and a mysterious stranger draw Porter back into the past, and back to Texas, to confront the twisted solution to those murders—and the secrets of his own soul.  When he was a young man in Austin in that spring of 1885, Porter fell in love. Her name was Eula Phillips. She was beautiful. She was married to someone else. And she was doomed to be a victim of the Servant Girl Annihilators.  The first victims were young Black women who worked in the households of Austin's most prominent citizens. The crimes were unspeakable, as the killer or killers used an ax and—in the newspaper parlance of the day—“outraged” the victims even as they were dying or already dead. The authorities were baffled. The murders continued, month after month, until suddenly, shockingly, on a bloody Christmas Eve, the pattern changed—and the trial that resulted would uncover an explosive scandal of sex and power that would tear the city of Austin apart.  The scene of these crimes was a capitol city in uneasy transition. On the wooded hills where outlaw gangs and Comanche Indians recently roamed now stood the grand homes of cattle barons and university professors. The animosities of the Civil War still lingered, and the struggle of Blacks for equality was just beginning. By day, politicians in the state legislature debated equal rights for women; by night, those same politicians mingled with the prostitutes of Guy Town, the city's notorious vice district. Southern manners concealed ugly secrets, all of which would be revealed before the saga of the Servant Girl Annihilators reached its end.  Against this remarkably rich and previously untapped background, Steven Saylor has crafted a novel that melds fact with fiction, employing characters both real and imagined. The crimes and trials described in ""A Twist at the End"" actually happened, and are described in intricate detail. In real life, no satisfactory resolution was reached. But in the course of investigating the crimes, Saylor has come up with his own startling conclusion to a century-old mystery. The result is a masterful novel of intrigue and murder, yet at the same time a romance of time and place, with a colorful cast of memorable characters brought vividly to life. It's a true tale of Texas, grand in both setting and scope.  ""A riveting historical mystery...It’s all fascinating and provocative.” (New York Times Book Review)  “One of the mystery genre’s most inventive writers has turned his considerable talents—and his considerable ambition—to Austin, Texas, in 1885...The result is a worthwhile, engrossing, deftly written novel...Throughout, Saylor brings to bear his remarkable ability to evoke a vanished time.” (Sunday Oregonian)  ""Saylor, a veteran of the historical novel, navigates these rapids with confident skill...Better still, in the manner of O.",Paperback,,,"

","If Turkey lived up to its potential, it could rule the world - but will it? A passionate report from the front lines For centuries few terrors were more vivid in the West than fear of ""the Turk,"" and many people still think of Turkey as repressive, wild, and dangerous. Crescent and Star is Stephen Kinzer's compelling report on the truth about this nation of contradictions - poised between Euroep and Asia, caught between the glories of its Ottoman past and its hopes for a democratic future, between the dominance of its army and the needs of its civilian citizens, between its secular expectations and its Muslim traditions. Kinzer vividly describes Turkey's captivating delights as he smokes a water pipe, searches for the ruins of lost civilizations, watches a camel fight, and discovers its greatest poet. But he is also attund to the political landscape, taking us from Istanbul's elegant cafes to wild mountain outposts on Turkey's eastern borders, while along the way he talks to dissidents and patriots, villagers and cabinet ministers. He reports on political trials and on his own arrest by Turkish soldiers when he was trying to uncover secrets about the army's campaigns against Kurdish guerillas. He explores the nation's hope to join the European Union, the human-rights abuses that have kept it out, and its difficult relations with Kurds, Armenians, and Greeks. Will this vibrant country, he asks, succeed in becoming a great democratic state? He makes it clear why Turkey is poised to become ""the most audacious nation of the twenty-first century.""",Paperback,,407 pages,"

","The Myth of the Liberal Media contends that the mainstream media are parts of a market system and that their performance is shaped primarily by proprietor/owner and advertiser interests. Using a propaganda model, it is argued that the commercial media protect and propagandize for the corporate system. Case studies of major media institutions--the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer--are supplemented by detailed analyses of ""word tricks and propaganda"" and the media's treatment of topics such as Third World elections, the Persian Gulf War, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the fall of Suharto, and corporate junk science.",Paperback,,328 pages,"

Media Lens has performed a major public service by carrying out this task with energy, insight, and care."" 		- Noam Chomsky ""Media Lens is doing an outstanding job of pressing the mainstream media to at least follow their own stated principles and meet their public service obligations. [This is] fun as well as enlightening."" 		- Edward S. HermanCan a corporate media system be expected to tell the truth about a world dominated by corporations?Can newspapers, including the 'liberal' Guardian and the Independent, tell the truth about catastrophic climate change -- about its roots in mass consumerism and corporate obstructionism -- when they are themselves profit-oriented businesses dependent on advertisers for 75% of their revenues?Can the BBC tell the truth about UK government crimes in Iraq when its senior managers are appointed by the government? Has anything fundamentally changed since BBC founder Lord Reith wrote of the establishment: ""They know they can trust us not to be really impartial""?Why did the British and American mass media fail to challenge even the most obvious government lies on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction before the invasion in March 2003? Why did the media ignore the claims of UN weapons inspectors that Iraq had been 90-95% ""fundamentally disarmed"" as early as 1998?This book answers these questions, and more.Since July 2001, Media Lens has encouraged thousands of readers to email senior editors and journalists, challenging them to account for their distorted reporting on Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, Haiti, East Timor, climate change, Western crimes in Central America, and much more. The responses -- often surprising, sometimes outrageous -- reveal the arrogance, unaccountability and servility to power of even our most respected media. ",Paperback,,256 pages,"

Like Thomas Paine before him, Alinsky was able to combine, both in his person and his writing, the intensity of political engagement with an absolute insistence on rational political discourse and adherence to the American democratic tradition.ContentsThe PurposeOf Means and EndsA Word about WordsThe Education of an OrganizerCommunicationIn the BeginningTacticsThe Genesis of Tactic ProxyThe Way Ahead",Paperback,,196 pages,"

","A major feature of the rise of Islamism in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and parts of the West is the rapid growth of a starkly repressive version of Islamic shari'a law, often fueled by funds and support from Saudi Arabia. The central purpose of Islamists, including terrorists, is to impose such law in all Muslim lands, and then throughout the world in a new Caliphate. Despite its importance, this worldwide growth of extreme shari'a is under-documented and little understood. By a comparative study over the last twenty-five years of Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Sudan, Nigeria, Malaysia, and Indonesia, this book shows its terrible effects on human rights, especially the status of women and religious freedom, of Muslims as well as religious minorities, and on democracy itself. It also shows that such laws are a direct threat to the American interest of advancing democracy and human rights, that the United States lacks a policy for dealing with the spread of extreme shari'a, and concludes with policy recommendations for the United States regarding specific countries confronting extreme shari'a.",Hardcover,,248 pages,"

","In a series of columns and essays that renowned journalist and former presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal wrote in the three years following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a unifying theme began to emerge: that Bush, billed by himself and by many others as a conservative, is in fact a radical--more radical than any president in American history. In How Bush Rules, Blumenthal provides a trenchant and vivid account of the progression of Bush's radical style--from his reliance on one-party rule and his unwillingness to allow internal debate to his elevation of the power of the vice president.Taking readers through pivotal events such as the hunt for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the rise of the foreign-policy neoconservatives, Abu Ghraib, the war on science, the Jack Abramoff scandal, and the catastrophic mishandling of Hurricane Katrina, the book tracks a consistent policy that calls for the president to have complete authority over independent federal agencies and to remain unbound by congressional oversight or even the law.In an incisive and powerful introduction, Blumenthal argues that these radical actions are not haphazard, but deliberately intended to fundamentally change the presidency and the government. He shows not only the historical precedents for radical governing, but also how Bush has taken his methods to unique extremes. With its penetrating account of a critical new era in American leadership, How Bush Rules is a devastating appraisal of the Bush presidency.",Hardcover,,420 pages,"

New York is what Sarajevo was. September 11th opened Pandora's box. The first war of globalization will be the global accident, the total accident, including the accident of science. And it is on the way. In 1968, Virilio abandoned his work in oblique architecture, believing that time had replaced space as the most important point of reflection because of the dominance of speed.

Speed facilitates the decoding of the human genome, and the possibility of another humanity: a humanity which is no longer extra-territorial, but extra-human.

","Nada parece turbar la vida de Pauline y Dexter Manford, un maduro matrimonio de la alta sociedad neoyorquina. La agenda de Pauline está llena de recepciones, visitas, reunions; su frase favorite es: ""Hay un momento para cada cosa"", y, en efecto, saca tiempo incluso para la meditación oriental. Cada noche, cuando el brillante abogado que es Manford llega del bufete, les espera el insoslayable compromise o cena de turno. La hija de ambos, Nona, la pareja formada por el atribulado Jim (fruto del primer matrimonio de Pauline) y la displicente Lita, y la prima Amalasuntha, noble italiana que aporta lustre aristocrático a la familia, component el círculo íntimo de Pauline, pero su vida social se despliega en todos los ámbitos de la burguesía de su ciudad. Sin embargo, el cosmopolita y ordenado universo de Pauline es más quebradizo de lo que aparenta: el aburrimiento, el vacío vital o las crueles sutilezas de la relaciones mundanas amenazan el frágil equilibrio de esa superficial vida regalada, que parece sumida en el plácido stupor de un sueño crepuscular.Edith Wharton (Nueva York, 1962-París, 1937) se movió siempre en los círculos de la alta sociedad de Estados Unidos y de Europa, y en ésta conoció a Henry James, que ejercería una duradera influencia en su vida y su obra. Publicó sus primeros relatos en Scribner's Magazine, si bien tuvo que esperar al éxito de de La casa de la alegría (1905) para que se la reconociese como una de las novelistas más importantes de su época. Establecida en París desde 1907, durante la Guerra mundial organize ayudas a los refugiados, actividad por la que fue condecorada con la Legión de Honor.

","""A major contribution to our understanding of the Kabbalah."" --Arthur Green, Professor of Jewish Thought, Brandeis UniversityIn the Zohar and other writings of the Kabbalah, Jewish mystics developed concepts and symbols to help them penetrate secrets of the cosmos that cannot be understood through reason or intellect. These ideas about God, human beings, and creation continue to fascinate and influence spiritual seekers of all persuasions today.In clear and easy-to-understand prose, Gershom Scholem, the pioneer of the modern study of Jewish mysticism explains the basic concepts of the Kabbalah: the mystical ""form of the imageless God""; good and evil; the Tsaddik or righteous soul; the Shekhinah, the feminine aspect of God; gilgul, the transmigration of souls; and tselem, the concept of the astral body. For anyone seeking to taste the mysteries of the Kabbalah, this is an essential book.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","When the Bible makes reference to the Holy Spirit it refers to the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ dwelling in and activating His people, influencing the world's moral direction. When, in the last of the last days, Jesus Christ's Holy Spirit is withdrawn from the world (2 Thessalonians 2:7) and the devil is allowed to reign freely, the world will have no moral direction. The purpose of The God-Man is to magnify the name of Jesus Christ and to explore the contradiction between multiple personalities in the Godhead and the absolute deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. The answer to a simple question puts things in proper perspective. Ask yourself: At the resurrection, when we get to heaven, will we see three personalities, three separate persons with three bodies? Or will we see One God on the throne? The book of Revelation tells us that the One we will see is Jesus Christ, God who revealed Himself in bodily form.",Hardcover,,216 pages,"

","Inspiration; a burning in your heart; a still, small voice; the Comforter; a witness; your constant companion. These are phrases and titles associated with the Holy Ghost. This book offers a generous treatment of this third member of the Godhead and demonstrates that - whether you are alone or in a crowd of people - this Guiding Spirit is willing to be with you, to fill you with comfort and pure intelligence, and enlighten you with understanding. It shows how the Holy Ghost is our link here on earth to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. The Holy Ghost - The Third Member of the Godhead shows how revelation is our sixth sense. It cited prophetic references and gives scriptural accounts for the various topics it covers, including associated gifts and conditions such as ""The Holy Spirit of Promise,"" ""The Second Comforter,"" ""The More Sure Word of Prophecy,"" and when a ""Calling and Election"" is made sure. This book explains how to teach by the Holy Ghost, or with the Spirit, and how to stay in tune with Him. It shows that the Holy Ghost gives us courage, so much so that the threats of men are of no consequence. It reminds us that what was available to Joseph Smith in the way of revelation is also available to us, as we become more ready to receive it. The Holy Ghost - The Third Member of the Godhead is clear and direct in its presentation, with a review at the end of each chapter, and a comrehensive bibliography.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

That God is great in wisdom, wondrous in power, yet full of mercy is assumed by many as common knowledge. But to entertain anything approaching an adequate conception of His being, nature, and attributes, as revealed in the Scripture, is something which very few people in these degenerate times have done. God is solitary in His excellency. ""Who is like unto Thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?""

Though born to Christian parents, prior to conversion he migrated into a Theosophical society (an occult gnostic group popular in England during that time), and quickly rose in prominence within their ranks. His conversion came from his father's patient admonitions from Scripture.

","Mechthild of Magdeburg's The Flowing Light of the Godhead is one of the great surprises of German medieval literature. Compiled between c.1250 and c.1282, it is an extraordinary piece of imaginative writing. It integrates visions, auditions, dialogues, prayers, hymns, lyrical love poems, letters, allegories and parables, and draws creatively on features from hagiography, the disputation, the treatise, and magic spells, as the author documents her relationship with God and with her contemporaries. Within the context of German literary history, it is the first text in the tradition of mystical writing that was neither a translation nor a free adaptation of a Latin text, but rather an independent composition in the vernacular. Also of major significance is the fact that this text was written by a woman, thus offering insights into the cultural and social-historical context of the female religious (Mechthild lived her adult life as a beguine and latterly as a nun) in thirteenth-century northern Europe. Selections from the text are presented here in translation with introduction and notes. Dr Elizabeth A. Andersen teaches in the School of Modern Languages, Newcastle University.",Hardcover,,176 pages,"

Come quella del ragazzo che racconta la sua tragedia sotto la maschera dell'innocente cronaca di una partita di calcio; o le vacanze di Carlos, che si riveleranno invece un passo decisivo nelle sue scelte politiche; o ancora la storia di Maite, che cucina le ricette dei suoi stessi tormenti interiori mentre apparentemente si prende cura del padre invalido.

","Since time immemorial, yogis, sages, and mystics have forsaken the pleasures of the ordinary world and gone to secluded places to meditate, eager to attain even a momentary vision of Lord Sri Krsna. To help the realization and remembrance of those who wished to fully absorb their consciousness in Him, Sri Krsna descended to earth from His transcendental abode five thousand years ago and revealed His eternal spiritual pastimes. The great sage Vyasadeva carefully recorded those pastimes in his Sanskrit writings, headed by Srimad-Bhagavatam, the crown jewel of all Vedic literature. Krsna is Srila Prabhupada's summary study of the Bhagavatam's essence -- its Tenth Canto -- and is thus the first comprehensive exposition in English of those extraordinary events. These stories transport the reader from the mundane and commonplace, beckoning him to participate in a miraculous journey to a transcendental realm beyond space and time, a realm where everything and everyone ! lives in the blissful light of the Supreme Absolute, an eternal transcendental youth -- Lord Sri Krsna, the ultimate object of knowledge and the supreme goal of life. This two-volume edition of Krsna, The Supreme Personality of Godhead, will inspire the sincere reader to ever-new levels of spiritual experience each time he opens its covers.",Paperback,,750 pages,"

","Tokyo is at the cutting edge of the design scene today, and worldwide interest continues to grow. To date, most books on Tokyo design have been published in Japanese, and very few books have catered for the now vast international market of designers and more general readers who want to know more about the city. As part of the second wave of books for the Interior Angles series by John Wiley, Tokyo Style covers brand new stylish interior design projects in Tokyo - from restaurants and bars, and hair and beauty salons to relaxation rooms and residential spaces - all completed within the last three years. The projects featured range from the internationally renowned to hidden back street gems, with the author's insider knowledge allowing us a privileged perspective, backed up with numerous facts and fascinating anecdotes. This book examines all the latest trends in Tokyo design, allowing the reader an insider's view of the city that has never been revealed before It is the first book to give a true picture of the scope of the subject, with a range of interior types from world-renowned to back-street projects It is crammed with full colour photography throughout - over 300 images It is the latest in the new Interior Angles series",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Melbourne is now coming to the fore as a design hotspot. With three and a half million inhabitants, it is on a scale that is livable and diverse. Its rich and varied cultural intimacy has enabled it to build up a unique dynamism, which is set to shift the entire design agenda of the world - much like Barcelona did in the 1980s and Antwerp did in the 1990s. Melbourne is to be the city of the noughties. The intense plurality of Melbourne's recent design culture is due to have a vast impact on the way in which we think about city regions and living in them. This is a story of wonderful spaces: in civic and institutional buildings; in galleries, bars, clubs and restaurants; in one of the world's tallest residential apartment buildings; in beach houses and mountain shacks; in workshops and studios; and in international sports venues.As Melbourne hosts the Commonwealth games in 2006, a vast influx of visitors will be experiencing these spaces for the first time. Through luscious photography and an accessible text, Design City Melbourne is devised not only to illustrate a wide range of fascinating interiors and their architecural matrices, but also to describe the people behind them and how these spaces support the vital culture of this uniquely mixed and cosmopolitan city. A metropolis that is situated in the same time zone as China, and which is pioneering in its European colonial matrix the admixture of new Asian urban forms.",Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Swatting mosquitoes in Muskoka on the first long weekend in May. Driving the Trans-Canada Highway. Questioning why the ABC song ends in ""z"" and not ""zed."" All these things are distinctly Canadian and now there's another one more: ""Chicken Soup for the Canadian Soul.""Written by fellow Canadians from Cape Breton Island to Prince Edward Island, from Montreal to Vancouver, this book reveals the people, the history and the special moments that give Canada such a distinctive charm and character. With chapters including: On Being Canadian, Living Your Dream, Overcoming Obstacles, On Love, On Kindness and Making a Difference, these stories weave a rich tapestry of life from the people who call Canada home.Notable stories include: hockey player Paul Henderson's ""Goal of the Century""; Chief Dan George's recounting of his great land; Marilyn Bell DiLascio's historic 1954 Lake Ontario swim; cartoonist Lynn Johnston's delightful story of an encounter with Wayne Gretzky; and journalist Sally Armstrong's details of Princess Diana's first trip to Canada.

Revenge and justice may seem empty dreams when the sun may flicker out at any moment, but such is the nature of man as it has always been since the dawn of time.Mumber Sull owed his loyalty to the long-vanished overlord Simbilis, whose knowledge and science were legendary, whose domains had extended over a vast terrain, and whose whereabouts had been lost for centuries. He persuaded Cugel that if they could but find Simbilis, they would both gain their just rewards.The story of their quest for Simbilis is a marvellous fantasy of wonder and adventure millions of years from now, on the Dying Earth that Jack Vance first described and which has now, by permission, been further chronicled by Michael Shea.",Paperback,,204 pages,"

","Aquejado de una larga enfermedad, llega un niño de diez años a la casona de sus abuelos, situada en el Barrio Alto de una señorial población gaditana, para pasar los tres meses de verano que se anuncia triste y aburrido. Pero habitan o visitan la casa parientes y personajes a la vez desconcertantes y fascinantes que poco a poco irán perturbando su riguroso ritual de aparente austeridad con estrafalarias y misteriosas rarezas. El niño, privilegiado observador pasivo, lo husmea todo, lo aprehende todo con una sensibilidad, cada vez más cercana a la de esos elegantes parientes, que viajan, recitan poemas y se rodean de exóticos personajes, o a la de las intrigantes sirvientas que cuidan de él, o incluso a la del palomo que anda cojeando por los tejados…Los inesperados acontecimientos que lo alborotarán todo servirán para revelarle no sólo la tragicómica complejidad de las relaciones adultas, sino también la auténtica extraña naturaleza que ya apunta en él.",,,,,['LGBT']

","From John Seabrook, one of our most incisive and amusing cultural critics, comes Nobrow, a fascinatingly original look at the radical convergence of marketing and culture.In the old days, highbrow was elite and unique and lowbrow was commercial and mass-produced. Those distinctions have been eradicated by a new cultural landscape where “good” means popular, where artists show their work at K-Mart, Titantic becomes a bestselling classical album, and Roseanne Barr guest edits The New Yorker: in short, a culture of Nobrow. Combining social commentary, memoir, and profiles of the potentates and purveyors of pop culture–entertainment mogul David Geffen, MTV President Judy McGrath, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Nobrow high-priest George Lucas, and others–Seabrook offers an enthralling look at our breakneck society where culture is ruled by the unpredictable Buzz and where even aesthetic worth is measured by units shipped.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Swirski begins with a series of groundbreaking questions about the nature of popular fiction, vindicating it as an artform that expresses and reflects the aesthetic and social values of its readers. He follows his insightful introduction to the socio-aesthetics of genre literature with a synthesis of the century long debate on the merits of popular fiction and a study of genre informed by analytic aesthetics and game theory. Swirski then turns to three ""nobrow"" novels that have been largely ignored by critics. Examining the aesthetics of ""artertainment"" in Karel Capek's War with the Newts, Raymond Chandler's Playback, and Stanislaw Lem's Chain of Chance, crossover tours de force, From Lowbrow to Nobrow throws new light on the hazards and rewards of nobrow traffic between popular forms and highbrow aesthetics.",Hardcover,,236 pages,"

But when the Bard Queen Bee, Parker Rodham, claims she's attacked in the woods, Ryan is all too happy to play bodyguard. Then teachers start disappearing and the campus is abuzz with news of the Hooded Sweatshirt Stalker -- not to mention sightings of a monster in the woods. But it's Miranda who feels like a moving target when she is accused not only of plagiarism but of suspicious involvement in the attacks!  Meanwhile, rumors are flying about what it really means that Miranda's wearing Ryan's varsity letterman jacket. And she just can't shake her nagging feelings for Heathcliff, who entrusted her with the locket that keeps him in the ""real"" world even though every one else thinks he's back where he belongs, in the pages of Wuthering Heights.

","Eve Dallas has a grisly double homicide to solve when two young lovers—both employees of the same prestigious accounting firm—are brutally killed on the same night. It doesn't leave Eve a lot of leftover time to put together a baby shower for her buddy Mavis, but that's supposedly what friends are for.Now Mavis needs another favor. Tandy Willowby, one of the moms-to-be in Mavis's birthing class, didn't show up for the shower. A recent emigrant from London, Tandy has few friends in New York, and no family—and she was really looking forward to the party. And when Eve enters Tandy's apartment and finds a gift for Mavis's shower wrapped and ready on the table—and a packed bag for the hospital still on the floor next to it—tingling runs up and down her spine.Normally, such a case would be turned over to Missing Persons. But Mavis wants no one else on the job but Eve—and Eve can't say no. She'll have to track Tandy down while simultaneously unearthing the deals and double-crosses hidden in the files of some of the city's richest and most secretive citizens, in a race against this particularly vicious killer. Luckily, her multimillionaire husband Roarke's expertise comes in handy with the number crunching. But as he mines the crucial data that will break the case wide open, Eve faces an all too real danger in the world of flesh and blood.",Mass Market Paperback,,338 pages,"

","In The Scarlet Ibis, Susan Hahn has created an intricately structured sequence of interlinked poems centered around the single compelling image of the ibis. The resonance of this image grows through each section of the book as Hahn skillfully employs theme and variation, counterpoint and mirroring techniques. The ibis first appears as part of an illusion, the disappearing object in a magician’s trick, which then evokes the greatest disappearing act of all—death—where there are no tricks to bring about a reappearance. The rich complexity multiplies as the second section focuses on a disappearing lady and a dramatic final section brings together the bird and the lady in their common plight—both caged by their mortality, their assigned time and role.  All of the illusions fall away during this brilliant denouement as the two voices share a dialogue on the power of metaphor as the very essence of poetry. bird trick iv It’s all about disappearance. About a bird in a cagewith a mirror, a simple twiston the handle at the sidethat makes it come and go at the magician’s insistence. It’s all about innocence.It’s all about acceptance.It’s all about compliance.It’s all about deference.It’s all about silence. It’s all about disappearance.",Paperback,,80 pages,"

","Scarlet Cavern By Vonna Harper When she spotted a video on the Internet of her best friend being sexually abused, model and businesswoman Shana Galliher contacted Recovery Inc. to help her rescue Lindsay from a place called Scarlet Cavern. From the moment she spotted her operative Ranger, she saw a man as seductive and dangerous as a burning candle or a blazing structure. If she'd ever met a more nakedly sexual creature, she couldn't remember. Watch it, Shana, she told herself. You don't know him, and you sure as hell can't trust him. What she couldn't possibly comprehend was Ranger's connection to Scarlet Cavern, and he wasn't about to tell her. Instead, he focused on introducing her to that dark, dangerous and seductive world in a way she'd never forget, and maybe never recover from. At first Ranger is very hesitant to introduce Shana into the lifestyle maintained by the owners of Scarlet Cavern. Her determination to save her friend makes him realize she will find a way into the bowels of hell with or without him. Finally, knowing he has no choice, Ranger agrees-but on his conditions. Shana must undergo training in the dark world of bondage and underground movies. She must learn to lean on Ranger, to become, in essence, his sex slave. What she doesn't anticipate is her growing attraction to Ranger and his growing need to have her in his life. The training is intense, sometimes painful, but extremely arousing. And it is only the beginning.",Paperback,,220 pages,"

","In the four years since her husband’s death, Melanie LaSalle’s life has been consumed with managing the family design firm and caring for her five-year-old daughter, Jerica. The possibility of a new relationship is the last thing on her mind. But when Melanie meets Joel Ellington, a new staff member at her church, she is instantly attracted to his warm spirit.As their friendship deepens, however, Melanie is troubled by something she can’t quite understand or explain. Joel seems to be hiding something–in fact, most areas of his past are off-limits, even to her. Because of her growing feelings for him, Melanie pushes her doubts away. But when unsettling facts come to light–and when Joel disappears, along with the contents of a church bank account–she can no longer ignore her fears. Now, torn between her feelings for Joel and evidence mounting against him, Melanie faces a heart-wrenching decision: to forget the man who gave her reason to love again or to trust Joel enough to give him her heart. Exploring the themes of the importance of truth, loyalty, and trust, A Scarlet Cord illustrates that who we are in Christ depends little on outward appearances and much on our relationship with him, and that through faith, we can find places of comfort, healing, and selfless love.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","This compelling book provides a meticulously documented account of officially sanctioned cannibalism in the southwestern province of Guangxi during the Cultural Revolution. Drawing on his unique access to local archives of the Chinese Communist Party and on extensive interviews with party officials, the victims’ relatives, and the murderers themselves, Zheng Yi paints a disturbing picture of official compliance in the systematic killing and cannibalization of individuals in the name of political revolution and “class struggle.”The treasure-trove of evidence Zheng Yi has unearthed offers unprecedented insights into the way the internecine, factional struggles of the Cultural Revolution reached a horrifying level of insanity and frenzy among the ethnic Zhuang people of Guangxi. Profoundly moving, acutely observed, and unflinchingly graphic, Scarlet Memorial is a shining example of a genre of investigative reporting that courageously and independently records obscure and officially censored historical events, revealing hidden dimensions of modern Chinese history and politics.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

The mother of an illegitimate child, Hester is compelled both by her Puritan community and her awareness of her own moral autonomy to wear a scarlet letter ""A"", a symbol of her adultery, upon her clothes. Her child is seen as the evidence of her sin and her refusal to name her lover taken as a token of her moral perversity. However, Hester emerges from the novel a woman whose integrity is intact. Born from the heart of New England, The Scarlet Letter is as much about individualchoice and moral responsibilities as about the birth pangs of a nation. --This text refers to the Paperback edition.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","This is Elizabeth Hand's long-awaited collection of short stories, centered around her Nebula and World Fantasy Award-winning novella The Last Summer at Mars Hill. There are 12 pieces in all here, ranging from those first published in places like Interzone and Pulphouse to a two-page poem taken from the pages of Asimov's. Although many readers may be familiar with Hand's longer works, such as Glimmering or Waking the Moon, here she shows that she's a master of short fiction as well. Her stylish prose and keen insights make for some wonderful stories. --Craig E.

","It is big and it is worth praising . ...Winterlong is a dense, graceful, bullying book of great length and much skill; it is a live tale, told in a live voice, by an author of muscle and drive and ambition; it shows the depth of talent available in science fiction. -- John Clute, ""The Washington Post"" Elizabeth Hand's darkly sensual debut novel took the science fiction and general reading public by storm and now, seven years later, it is available again in a handsome trade paperback edition. Heralded as a considerable stylistic and imaginative accomplishment, as noteworthy in its way as Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, by ""People"" magazine, Winterlong explores the disturbing remains of humanity irrevocably altered by genetic engineering run amok.Amid the ruins of a once great city, a girl and her beautiful long-lost twin brother are drawn to the seductive voice of a green-eyed boy whose name is Death. Together they must journey through a poisoned garden filled with children who kill and beasts that speak--all the while resisting the evil that compels them to join in a nightmare ritual of blood that will unleash the power of the ancients and signal the end of humanity.",Paperback,,496 pages,"

","Why did Fonzie hang around with all those high school boys?Is the overwhelming boy-meets-girl content of popular teen movies, music, books, and TV just a cover for an undercurrent of same-sex desire? From the 1950s to the present, popular culture has involved teenage boys falling for, longing over, dreaming about, singing to, and fighting over, teenage girls. But Queering Teen Culture analyzes more than 200 movies and TV shows to uncover who Frankie Avalon's character was really in love with in those beach movies and why Leif Garrett became a teen idol in the 1970s. In Top 40 songs, teen magazines, movies, TV soap operas and sitcoms, teenagers are defined by their pubescent ""discovery"" of the opposite sex, universally and without exception. Queering Teen Culture looks beyond the litany to find out when adults became so insistent about teenage sexual desire--and why--and finds evidence of same-sex desire, romantic interactions, and identities that, according to the dominant ideology, do not and cannot exist. This provocative book examines the careers of male performers whose teenage roles made them famous (including Ricky Nelson, Pat Boone, Fabian, and James Darren) and discusses examples of lesbian desire (including I Love Lucy and Laverne and Shirley). Queering Teen Culture examines: Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best,  and Leave It to Beaver: Were Ricky, Bud, and Wally sufficiently straight?the juvenile delinquent films of the 1950s: Why weren't the rebel-without-a-cause ""bad boys"" interested in girls?horror, sci-fi, and zombies from outer space: ""Body of a boy! Mind of a monster! Soul of an unearthly thing!""teen idols--pretty, androgynous, and feminine: No wonder they were rumored to be ""funny""beach movies: She wants to plan their wedding but he wants to surf, sky-dive and go drag racing with the guysBiker-hippies boys of the late 1960s: ""I know your scene--don't think I don't!""the 1950s nostalgia of the 1970s: Why does Fonzie spend all his time with high school boys?teen gore: What makes the psycho-killer angry?and much more, including Gidget, the Brat Pack, buddy dramas, nerds and ""operators,"" Saved by the Bell, The Real World,  and the incredible shrinking teenagerQueering Teen Culture is an essential read for academics working in cultural and gay studies, and for anyone else with an interest in popular culture.",Paperback,,221 pages,"

","All That Hollywood Allows explores the representation of gender in popular Hollywood melodramas of the 1950s, the last decade in which film enjoyed a pivotal cultural position. Both a work of feminist film criticism and theory and an analysis of popular culture, this provocative book examines from a cultural studies perspective the top-grossing film melodramas of that decade, including A Streetcar Named Desire, From Here to Eternity, East of Eden, Imitation of Life, and Picnic.Stereotypically viewed as a complacent and idyllic time, the 1950s were actually a period of dislocation and great social change as Americans struggled to regain their equilibrium in the wake of World War II. Jackie Byars argues that mass-media texts of the period, especially films, provide evidence of society's consuming preoccupation with the domestic sphere -- the nuclear family and its values. The melodramas included in her study appeared in theaters just as women were leaving their homes for the workplace. Some films challenged and some reinforced previously sacrosanct gender roles. Byars shows how Hollywood melodramas participated in, interpreted, and extended societal debates concerning family structure, sexual divisions of labor, and gender roles.Byars's readings of these films assess a variety of critical methodologies and approaches to textual analysis, some central to feminist film studies and some that previously have been bypassed by scholars in the field. She specifically questions the validity of readings grounded solely on the premises of psychoanalysis, arguing that the male norm inherent in the psychoanalytic viewpoint may well prevent us from hearing, let alone understanding, the female voices that make their way into the most patriarchal of films. Byars thus critiques earlier approaches to the study of women's films and offers fresh readings, emphasizing from several important perspectives the suppressed female voice.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Sinister, swaggering, yet often sympathetic, the figure of the gangster has stolen and murdered its way into the hearts of American cinema audiences. Despite the enduring popularity of the gangster film, however, traditional criticism has focused almost entirely on a few canonical movies such as Little Caesar, Public Enemy, and The Godfather trilogy, resulting in a limited and distorted understanding of this diverse and changing genre.Mob Culture offers a long-awaited, fresh look at the American gangster film, exposing its hidden histories from the Black Hand gangs of the early twentieth century to The Sopranos. Departing from traditional approaches that have typically focused on the ""nature"" of the gangster, the editors have collected essays that engage the larger question of how the meaning of criminality has changed over time. Grouped into three thematic sections, the essays examine gangster films through the lens of social, gender, and racial/ethnic issues.Destined to become a classroom favorite, Mob Culture is an indispensable reference for future work in the genre.",Paperback,,326 pages,"

The Nanny Diaries
 meets Lucky Jim in this devilish satire of the culture of power and privilege at a New York City private school.John Spencer, an English teacher at the elite Academy X, is struggling through the final weeks of the spring semester. But keeping his students focused on the genius and wit of Jane Austen is the least of his problems. His crush on the sexy librarian is beginning to warp his judgment. An unexpected promotion leaves him drowning in a sea of academic intrigue. Pushy parents demanding higher grades lurk behind every corner and a favorite pupil suddenly reveals a cunning and sophistication far beyond her years. With each bumbling effort to keep everyone happy (and get his girl!), John digs himself deeper into trouble, until his very career is at stake. Witty and rollicking, Academy X is a priceless peek into New York City's top private schools--indeed into elite schools all over the country--where parents risk all for their child's academic resume and no price is too high (or pressure too great) to achieve a coveted admission to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","The greatest cultural accomplishments in history have never been the result of the brainstorms of marketing men, corporate focus groups or any homogenized methods; they have always happened organically. More often than not, these manifestations have been the result of a few like-minded people coming together to create something new and original for no other purpose than a common love of doing it. In the 1990s, a loose-knit group of American artists and creators, many just out of their teens, began their careers in just such a way. Influenced by the popular underground youth subcultures of the day, such as skateboarding, graffiti, street fashion and independent music, artists like Shepard Fairey, Mark Gonzales, Spike Jonze, Margaret Kilgallen, Mike Mills, Barry McGee, Phil Frost, Chris Johanson, Harmony Korine and Ed Templeton began to create art that reflected the lifestyles they led. Many had no formal training and almost no conception of the inner workings of the art world. They learned their crafts through practice, trial and error, and good old-fashioned innovation. Not since the Beat Generation have we seen a group of creative individuals with such a unified aesthetic sense and varied cultural facets. The world of art has been greatly affected by their accomplishments as have the worlds of fashion, music, literature, film, and, ironically, athletics. Beautiful Losers is a retrospective celebration of this spirit, with hundreds of artworks by over two dozen artists, from precursors like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Larry Clark, to more recent adherents Ryan McGinness, KAWS and Geoff McFetridge. Work in all conceivable mediums is included, plus reproductions of reams of ephemera. The accompanying essays are contributed by a half-dozen writers who have championed these beautiful losers from the start. This paperback reprint includes more pages, more images, an exhibition checklist, installation shots from a variety of exhibitions and an interview with Beautiful Losers advocate Agnes B.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

The novel centres upon the hapless members of a love triangle united by their sexual obsessions and by their fascination with Catherine Tekakwitha, the 17th-century Mohawk saint.

","A New Translation From The French By Marion WieselNight is Elie Wiesel s masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie s wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author s original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man s capacity for inhumanity to man.Night offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.Author Bio: Elie Wiesel is the internationally celebrated author, Nobellaureate, and spokesperson for humanity whose decision to dedicate his lifeto bearing witness for the Holocaust's martyrs and survivors found itsearliest and most enduring voice in Night, his penetrating and profoundaccount of the Nazi death camps. Born in the town of Sighet, Transylvania,he was a teenager when he and his family were taken from their home in 1944to the Auschwitz concentration camp, and then to Buchenwald. Night is theterrifying record of Elie Wiesel's memories of the death of his family, thedeath of his own innocence, and his despair as a deeply observant Jewconfronting the absolute evil of man. Elie Wiesel is the author of more than forty internationally acclaimed worksof fiction and nonfiction. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal ofFreedom, the United States of America Congressional Gold Medal, the FrenchLegion of Honor, and, in 1986, the Nobel Peace Prize. He is the Andrew W.Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at BostonUniversity.",Hardcover,,158 pages,"

","The shattering crime story that shocked the nation: the Thomas Capano murder case On a June evening in 1996, 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, secretary to the governor of Delaware, vanished without a trace following a restaurant rendezvous with her secret lover of more than two years: Thomas Capano. One of Wilmington's most prominent and respected figures, a millionaire attorney and former state prosecutor, ""Tommy"" was a charming, softspoken family man. But in the weeks and months that followed Fahey's disappearance, investigators would gradually uncover the shocking truth: Capano was a steely manipulator driven by power and greed -- and capable of brutal murder. In a riveting narrative expertly documented by probing interviews, diary entries, and e-mail correspondence, and with superb insight into the twisted motivations of a killer, Ann Rule chronicles a real-life drama of Shakespearian proportions: ambitions fall, love turns to obsession, family names are tainted, the façade of success crumbles -- and a beautiful but vulnerable young woman pays the ultimate price in a convoluted and deadly relationship.",Paperback,,688 pages,"

","""My job isn't to revolutionize anything. My job is to give women a sense of relief, to acknowledge what they're struggling with."" -Cathy GuisewiteLike women around the globe, Cathy has been constantly puzzled by her romantic relationships. From Irving to Simon to Alex, the men in Cathy's life have provided a never-ending source of confusion and amusement ever since the strip began in 1976. ""If men's hair falls out,"" our weary heroine laments, ""it's because there's nothing in there for it to hold onto.""It's no wonder, then, that cartoonist Cathy Guisewite's Cathy collection should be called Understanding the ""Why"" Chromosome. In this hilarious book, Cathy outdoes herself in witty revelations about men, food, Mom, and career: Cathy's four basic guilt groups. Cathy epitomizes the highs and lows felt by distaff women throughout the world.In Understanding the ""Why"" Chromosome, Cathy's found a new challenge: a boyfriend who's a decade younger than she. Fitness fanatic Alex, who's sensitive and not particularly ambitious, introduces Cathy to an entirely new relationship angst, then introduces her to his hip, young mother. Cathy's baffled by the age difference, but is just as stumped when he proposes. ""What's wrong with our relationship the way it is now? ""she wails when Alex finally pops the question.Throughout her trials and tribulations, Cathy's friends keep her sane. There's happily married Charlene, the office loudspeaker; exhausted Andrea, mother of Zenith and Gus; her well-meaning mom and dad; Cathy's unrealistic boss, Mr. Pinkley; and bouncy little Electra, Cathy's canine alter ego. Her frequent and frustrating shopping excursions also give rise to an enormous wave of female recognition ""Skip the clothes and just shove a Stairmaster through the curtain,"" Cathy deadpans.Cathy Guisewite is an enormously talented cartoonist who has won numerous awards for her strip and animated television shows. Her countless fans trust Cathy to constantly express the right blend of humor and observation almost as if she had x-ray vision into the human condition.",Paperback,,128 pages,"

As children Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy were students at Hailsham, an exclusive boarding school secluded in the English countryside. It was a place of mercurial cliques and mysterious rules where teachers were constantly reminding their charges of how special they were. Now, years later, Kathy is a young woman. Ruth and Tommy have reentered her life. And for the first time she is beginning to look back at their shared past and understand just what it is that makes them special–and how that gift will shape the rest of their time together.

","Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts—one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow—the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue—including the vodka-drinking black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita—exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grotesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.Though completed in 1940, ""The Master and Margarita"" wasn't published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine ""Moskva."" It was an immediate and enduring success: audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom.",Hardcover,,,"

","The idea of man as an essentially irrational being has preoccupied some of the most influential of Russian thinkers, including the three important Soviet writers considered by Dr Edwards in this book. Since the 1917 Revolution the polemic between rationalists and irrationalists has become directly relevant to the way life is lived in the Soviet Union, and a knowledge of the irrationalist point of view is essential for an understanding of much of Soviet literature and of the foundations of Soviet dissidence. As with other titles in this series, this book is not intended simply for the specialist. The broad speculations arising from the subject will fascinate all those who take a serious interest in the Russian literary tradition; a tradition whose principal figures have been concerned to reject philosophical and political creeds that, in seeking to produce a perfect human being in a perfect society, point in fact towards a vision of hell.",Hardcover,,,"

Jiménez admira a Neruda y espera pacientemente que algún día el poeta le dedique un libro, o que se produzca algo más que un brevísimo cruce de palabras y el pago de la propina. Su anhelo se verá finalmente recompensado y entre ambos se entablará una relación muy peculiar.

Because of the strict rules that guide the Plain community, she must continually squelch her artistic passion, although it has become her solace.

El protagonista, Solo, se suma a la juerga continua y al gamberrismo andante de sus inseparables compañeros tratando de huir del recuerdo de Bárbara, pero cada paso le acerca más a ella, al amor de su vida. La exaltación de la libertad, de la juventud, de la adolescencia eterna termina por recordarles que todo se acaba, que tras las carcajadas asoman las frustraciones. ""Cuatro amigos"" es el relato agridulce del final de una época, de una edad. David Trueba reincide con su segunda novela en el contraste de tonalidades, entre la pura comedia disparatada y el más desatado romanticismo, y despliega de nuevo su talento narrativo en un espacio muy poco transitado en la nueva literatura española.",Hardcover,,,"

","Los personajes de Los estados carenciales buscan como todos nosotros la felicidad a su manera. Tratan de no sucumbir a la rutina, de escapar de la mediocridad o de rehacer sus vidas con un poco de sentido. Ulises, abandonado por su mujer Penélope, vive con su hijo Telémaco. Penélope es una diseñadora de moda que no se corta tanto como la Penélope de siempre cuando le sale al paso algún pretendiente. Al suegro de Ulises, Vili, su mujer le hace la vida imposible, y él busca la felicidad con optimismo y algunas ideas peregrinas, como montar una nueva Academia para enseñarles a una pandilla de infelices que la felicidad consiste, comod ecía Platón, en hacer el bien. Sátira de los libros de autoayuda, meditación sobre la felicidad, homenaje al mundo clásico... Sí, todas esas cosas son y están en Los estados carenciales. Pero esta novela es, por encima de todo una divertidísima fábula sobre las debilidades y grandezas de la condición humana. Ángela Vallvey tiene una prosa jugosa y directa, una capacidad poética deslumbrante, un sentido del humor que nos incita a la reflexión filosófica sin que nos alcance el sueño, la desazón o la pedantería, Tal vez este libro no nos permita saber si la felicidad consiste enhacer bien, o en desarrollar nuestras capacidades con la máxima destreza, pero sí nos puede ayudar a mirarnos en el espejo con valentía, con la dignidad que nuestra condición exige.",Paperback,,216 pages,"

","1° novembre 1975. Francisco Franco agonizza nella sua residenza, circondato dalla famiglia e da operosi luminari che dovrebbero salvargli la vita. Re Hassan II, approfittando del vuoto di potere, ha organizzato la Marcia Verde per favorire l’annessione del Sahara occidentale al Marocco, sottraendolo agli occupanti spagnoli.Mentre la Storia si avvicina a grandi passi alla fine del Generale, a San Esteban, paesino rurale vicino a Toledo, don Alberto, un giovane sacerdote, rinviene il cadavere nudo di una donna davanti a una chiesa. Essendo nuovo del posto, non la riconosce, ma la gente si premura di fargliene un vivido ritratto: si tratta di Clara, ragazza madre bella e anticonformista, considerata pietra dello scandalo dai bacchettoni locali. Con l’aiuto di Ricardo, un suo chierichetto, don Alberto inizia un’indagine privata, parallela a quella della Guardia Civil. La loro inchiesta darà modo di esplorare le pieghe del torpore benpensante e della morbosità conservatrice del piccolo borgo rurale, e di svelare i grandi orrori celati fra le pareti domestiche e rimossi da una collettività moralmente malata.",,,,,['Roman']

Esto es lo queVargas Llosa pone de relieve en esta novela: el mundo de utopías que fue elsiglo XIX. Un nexo de unión entre dos personajes que optan por dos modelosvitales opuestos que desvelan un deseo común: el de alcanzar un Paraísodonde sea posible la felicidad para los seres humanos.In 1844, Flora Tristán embarked on a tour of France to campaign for workers' and women's rights. In 1891, her grandson Paul Gauguin set sail for Tahiti, determined to escape civilization and paint primitive masterpieces. Flora died before her grandson was born, but their travels and obsessions unfold side by side in this deft, utterly absorbing novel.Flora, the illegitimate child of a wealthy Peruvian father and French mother, grows up in poverty, and after fleeing a brutal husband, journeys to Peru to demand her inheritance. On her return, she makes her name as a popular writer and a champion of the downtrodden, setting herself the arduous task of touring the French countryside to recruit members for her Workers' Union. Paul, struggling painter and stubborn visionary, abandons his wife and five children for life in the South Seas, where his dreams of paradise are poisoned by syphilis, the stifling forces of French colonialism, and a chronic lack of funds, though he has his pick of teenage Tahitian lovers and paints some of his greatest works.",Hardcover,,490 pages,"

On sultry summer nights, hapless mortals are prey to the deceptions of undines, ravishing mermaids and dangerous nixies. Languid summer makes way for the infernal dance of the evil spirits of autumn, a witches'' Sabbath attended by kobolds, succubi and nightmare spirits. From Earth's lower depths come the rumblings of armies of dwarves and gnomes preparing to burst out to the surface. Winter follows, the season when the Nordic gods sweep through on their doomed hunt for Asgard, harbingers of Christmas visitors attended by the nisses and tomtes of the Great North. Still farther north, Earth trembles beneath the footsteps of giant trolls.A spellbinding book, superbly illustrated by enchanting and sometimes terrifying images, that must surely rank as a passport to the Enchanted Kingdom.",Hardcover,,184 pages,"

","Over 900,000 Americans a year are dying of heart disease - and the numbers are rising. Our current diet and exercise strategies have failed to find a solution. According to Al Sears, M. D., it's time to abandon the Modern Gospel of low-fat food and long-duration exercise as a path to heart health. We need the very opposite: heart disease continues to be America's biggest killer - and obesity has reached epidemic proportions - because of the fad for low-fat diets and despite aerobics.The solution is to reengineer the diet and exercise habits of our hunter-gatherer ancestors to fit our modern culture. To build a strong and resilient heart, says Dr. Sears, engage in brief, explosive bouts of intense exercise. Consume a diet rich in high quality fat, organic proteins and liberal helpings of fruits and vegetables. Avoid grain-based starches. Take supplements to counteract the nutritional deficiencies of modern produce.Dr. Sears has used this plan to help more than 15,000 patients successfully reverse heart disease, build stronger hearts, manage their weight and abandon their heart",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Born in London in 1908, Ian Fleming worked variously as a banker and journalist before serving in the British Naval Intelligence during World War II. He published his first novel, ""Casino Royale"" in 1953 and thus started the astoundingly successful James Bond novels and films. Fleming died in 1964.This omnibus collection includes the 3 quintessential stories in this series . While these are the 5th, 6th, and 7th books, they are at the apex of his popularity, the actual cold war and were the first 3 turned into movies as well . In ""From Russia With Love (1957)"", SMERSH is the Soviet organ of vengeance, of interrogation, torture and death. James Bond is dedicated to the destruction of its agents wherever he finds them. Then the cold eye of SMERSH focuses on Bond and far away in Moscow a trap is laid for him. In ""Doctor No (1958)"", M calls this case a soft option. Bond can't quite agree. The tropical island is luxurious, the seductive Honey Rider is beautiful and willing. However, they are both part of the empire of Dr No. His obsession is power, and his gifts are pain-shaped. In ""Goldfinger (1959)"", a friendly game of two-handed canasta turns out to be thoroughly crooked and a beautiful girl ends up dead. In Bond's first encounter with Auric Goldfinger - the world's cleverest, cruellest criminal - useful lessons are learned.",Hardback,,832 pages,"

","You know the name. You know the number. Now know the rest of the story. Published to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Dr. No, the first James Bond film, James Bond: The Legacy is the official, definitive guide to the 007 phenomenon. Loaded with anecdotes, facts, and illustrations, the book provides features on the key actors, from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan, directors, costume and set designers, and others working behind the scenes. Without a doubt, this is the book of the Bond World. James Bond: The Legacy takes readers through a comprehensive-and fun-history of the movies. The book places the films in the context of their times, showing how producers Albert Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman drew inspiration from the Cold War and from suave, glamorous icons like Hugh Hefner and JFK, and how later world events shaped story lines-and even how closely the series presaged actual technological developments. As the films move into their fifth decade, the book traces the total Bond impact, through fashion, the Austin Powers films, the Robbie Williams video, and much more, on a whole new generation. Illustrated with over 550 rare photographs, illustrations, and storyboards from the Bond archives, James Bond: The Legacy ties in with major events and promotions marking 007's 40th anniversary. This will be a must-have book for the 2002 holiday season.",Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","No man can be all things at once, no matter how hard he tries, but no man ever tried harder than Richard Francis Burton. He made significant contributions in the fields of literature and geography, and was also a poet, traveler, soldier, diplomat, inventor, explorer, archaeologist, student of religion and more. But above all, Burton was an adventurer in both the intellectual and spiritual world.Byron Farwell spent seven years investigating virtually every place ever visited by Burton. He overcame formidable difficulties in tracking down and reading all of Burton's extant works (his widow, Isabel, had burned most of his books when he died). Still, Burton proved a highly elusive subject for his biographer. But he has at last been caught. The result is a magnificent biography and a story that fascinates and compels.",Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Sindh Revisited is the remarkable story of the author's fascination with the early life of Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821-1890). It is the story of an incredible journey, too - deep into the heart of British India, and the India and Sindh of today. The very name of Sir Richard Burton conjures up images of adventure. His search for the source of the Nile with John Hanning Speke contributed to his being the best-known traveller of the nineteenth century. Burton was an outstanding orientalist, archaeologist, linguist, anthropologist, and a controversial diplomat. Christopher Ondaatje's Sindh Revisited is the extraordinarily sensitive account of the author's quest to uncover the secrets of the seven years Richard Burton spent in India in the army of the East India Company from 1842 to 1849. ""If I wanted to fill the gap in my understanding of Richard Burton, I would have to do something that had never been done before: follow in his footsteps in India."" The journey covered thousands of miles-trekking across deserts where ancient tribes meet modern civilization in the valley of the mighty Indus River.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Legions of Clive Barker fans will relish three early works from the wicked imagination of one of the best-known fantasy/horror writers of the decade.Incarnations is a cross-disciplinary marvel, a great, glorious feast of the imagination taking us on a journey through wildly varied theatrical and emotional terrains, from the pain and intrigue of domestic transgressions to the monstrous horrors wrought by war; from lustful garden liasons to subterranean cannibalism. Barker uses unpredictable rhythms that draw less from theatrical convention and more from life itself, with apocalyptic spectacle and intimate reality sharing the stage as equal and sometimes indistinguishable partners.The three works that make up Incarnations - Colossus; Frankenstein in Love, or the Life of Death; and The History of the Devil, or Scenes from a Pretended Life -- combine the shock and magic and heartbreak that has made Barker's unique vision a compelling force in all the media he has touched.",Paperback,,366 pages,"

","""Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red."" For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the Books of Blood is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:  I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.  These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; ""The Yattering and Jack,"" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; ""In the Hills, the Cities,"" an unusual example of an original horror premise; ""Dread,"" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; ""Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,"" about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. --Fiona Webster",Hardcover,,818 pages,"

","For more than two decades, Clive Barker has twisted the worlds of horrific and surrealistic fiction into a terrifying, transcendent genre all his own. With skillful prose, he enthralls even as he horrifies; with uncanny insight, he disturbs as profoundly as he reveals. Evoking revulsion and admiration, anticipation and dread, Barker's works explore the darkest contradictions of the human condition: our fear of life and our dreams of death.",Paperback,,358 pages,"

For centuries, Japan had isolated itself from the outside world by refusing to trade with other countries and even refusing to help shipwrecked sailors, foreign or Japanese. The country's people still lived under a feudal system like that of Europe in the Middle Ages. But everything began to change when American Commodore Perry and his troops sailed to the Land of the Rising Sun, bringing with them new science and technology, and a new way of life.NOTE: Blumberg's ""Shipwrecked!

","Tsunayoshi (1646-1709), the fifth Tokugawa shogun, is one of the most notorious figures in Japanese history. Viewed by many as a tyrant, his policies were deemed eccentric, extreme, and unorthodox. His Laws of Compassion, which made the maltreatment of dogs an offense punishable by death, earned him the nickname Dog Shogun, by which he is still popularly known today. However, Tsunayoshi's rule coincides with the famed Genroku era, a period of unprecedented cultural growth and prosperity that Japan would not experience again until the mid-twentieth century. It was under Tsunayoshi that for the first time in Japanese history considerable numbers of ordinary townspeople were in a financial position to acquire an education and enjoy many of the amusements previously reserved for the ruling elite.Based on a masterful re-examination of primary sources, this exciting new work by a senior scholar of the Tokugawa period maintains that Tsunayoshi's notoriety stems largely from the work of samurai historians and officials who saw their privileges challenged by a ruler sympathetic to commoners. Beatrice Bodart-Bailey's insightful analysis of Tsunayoshi's background sheds new light on his personality and the policies associated with his shogunate. Tsunayoshi was the fourth son of Tokugawa Iemitsu (1604-1651) and left largely in the care of his mother, the daughter of a greengrocer. Under her influence, Bodart-Bailey argues, the future ruler rebelled against the values of his class. As evidence she cites the fact that, as shogun, Tsunayoshi not only decreed the registration of dogs, which were kept in large numbers by samurai and posed a threat to the populace, but also the registration of pregnant women and young children to prevent infanticide. He decreed, moreover, that officials take on the onerous tasks of finding homes for abandoned children and caring for sick travelers.In the eyes of his detractors, Tsunayoshi's interest in Confucian and Buddhist studies and his other intellectual pursuits were merely distractions for a dilettante. Bodart-Bailey counters that view by pointing out that one of Japan's most important political philosophers, Ogyu Sorai, learned his craft under the fifth shogun. Sorai not only praised Tsunayoshi's government, but his writings constitute the theoretical framework for many of the ruler's controversial policies. Another salutary aspect of Tsunayoshi's leadership that Bodart-Bailey brings to light is his role in preventing the famines and riots that would have undoubtedly taken place following the worst earthquake and tsunami as well as the most violent eruption of Mount Fuji in history--all of which occurred during the final years of Tsunayoshi's shogunate.The Dog Shogun is a thoroughly revisionist work of Japanese political history that touches on many social, intellectual, and economic developments as well. As such it promises to become a standard text on late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth-century Japan.",Hardcover,,378 pages,"

","This is the first book to celebrate the life and writing of one of the most charismatic Southern leaders of the middle twentieth century, Don West (1906-1992). West was a poet, a pioneer advocate for civil rights, a preacher, a historian, a labor organizer, a folk-music revivalist, an essayist, and an organic farmer. He is perhaps best known as an educator, primarily as cofounder of the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee and founder of the Appalachian South Folklife Center in West Virginia. In his old age, West served as an elder statesman for his causes.  No Lonesome Road allows Don West to speak for himself. It provides the most comprehensive collection of his poetry ever published, spanning five decades of his literary career. It also includes the first comprehensive and annotated collection of West's nonfiction essays, articles, letters, speeches, and stories, covering his role at the forefront of Southern and Appalachian history, and as a pioneer researcher and writer on the South's little-known legacy of radical activism.   Drawing from both primary and secondary sources, including previously unknown documents, correspondence, interviews, FBI files, and newspaper clippings, the introduction by Jeff Biggers stands as the most thorough, insightful biographical sketch of Don West yet published in any form.   The afterword by George Brosi is a stirring personal tribute to the contributions of West and also serves as a thoughtful reflection on the interactions between the radicals of the 1930s and the 1960s.   The best possible introduction to his extraordinary life and work, this annotated selection of Don West's writings will be inspirational reading for anyone interested in Southern history, poetry, religion, or activism.  ",Paperback,,280 pages,"

","Penzler Pick, March 2001: To talk about murder in a bookmobile is to invite jokes about those cozy mysteries where ""hard-boiled"" describes only the deviled egg platter at some PTA lunch. However, in Betsy Thornton's High Lonesome Road, that's just where it does occur, mere pages into her second novel featuring Chloe Newcombe. This complicated, stubborn, and likeable heroine, who made her debut in The Cowboy Rides Away, is a divorced New Yorker now transplanted to Arizona's high desert region where she's taken a job as a victim's advocate with the county attorney's office. (Her creator writes from on-the-job experience: Thornton herself works helping crime victims and witnesses in a rural Arizona county.) Here Chloe must again endure a wrenching personal involvement, this time because the murdered woman (the bookmobile driver whose body has been found riddled with bullets, a book clutched to her chest) had long ago been a friend of Chloe's adored older brother, himself also now dead and deeply mourned. Thornton has been described as a writer possessing ""a real feeling for those whose nerves have been rubbed raw by life"" (Publishers Weekly). Cochise County, Arizona, after all, is a catchment area for the outcast, the oddball, the loner, and the lost soul, a place where even the ordinary citizens have made a definite choice about how much--or how little--mileage to keep between themselves and the dangerous edge. And, as Chloe Newcombe says, ""Let's face it, none of us goes that innocently about our lives. We live with anger and pain every day, live in secrecy; it's just part of living."" Her quest for the truth leads to the usual scabbed-over ancient crime and the usual desperate need to forget/remember, and Chloe holds our attention because she is an unusual figure keeping to a set of rules all her own. Like Elwood Reid's Midnight Sun, another recent book set in a vividly evoked harsh landscape (off-the-map Alaskan back country), High Lonesome Road is as compelling for its psychic geography as it is for its unspooling mystery plot. Thornton's noir is desert-bleached, touched with a feminine sensibility, but tough all the same. --Otto Penzler",,,,,['Mystery']

","Written while in exile in the United States, “Time” and “Space” were originally intended to appear together in a single volume. Not until 1986, however, did they appear so in Spanish— and not until 1988 were they published together in English. By presenting them together, Jiménez had wanted them to convey the same continuity of emotion, the same philosophical intensity, that he had experienced while writing them. “All My Life,” he wrote in his introduction, “I have toyed with the idea of writing a continuous poem...with no concrete theme, sustained only by its own surprise, its rhythm, its discoveries, its light, its successive joys; that is, its intrinsic elements, its essence.” That continuous poem is Time and Space the last book Jiménez wrote. Presented here in a bilingual edition, Time and Space will take readers of both English and Spanish on the longest and most sustained ride on the crest of poetry they will ever enjoy.  “The greatest poem in this Century...” —Octavio Paz   Antonio T. de Nicolás, translator and editor of Time and Space is also widely known for his highly acclaimed translation of the Juan Ramón Jiménez classic, Platero and I, as well as many other works in Spanish. His first book of poetry, Remembering the God to Come, is also being published by iUniverse.com.",Paperback,,204 pages,"

","Sócrates dedicó su vida a la misión, considerada por él sagrada, de ayudar a sus conciudadanos a conocerse a si mismos y a ser mejores. A pesar de ello, a lo largo de su existencia, el filósofo se granjeó numerosos enemigos. En el año 399 tres ciudadanos lo acusaron de corromper a la juventud, de no creer en los dioses en los que la ciudad creía y de introducir nuevas divinidades. Por tales supuestos delitos los acusadores pidieron la pena de muerte.Sócrates proclamó que no merecía pena alguna, sino que, por el contrario, el Estado habría debido mantenerlo por cumplir con la misión encomendada por el dios de beneficiar a todos.Irritados los jueces por su actitud, lo condenaron a muerte.Después de cumplir un mes de cárcel, Sócrates bebió la cicuta que le trajo el carcelero y murió serenamente.Defensa de Sócrates y Critón son dos sublimes diálogos que poseen una ordenada y elegante claridad, animada por un íntimo fervor, donde Platón nos muestra la figura de Sócrates en el vivo atractivo de su simplicidad y grandeza.Para esta Biblioteca, el profesor Manuel Rafael Aragó tradujo los diálogos directamente del griego, prologando y anotando además la edición.",Paperback,,107 pages,"

","Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara was one of the greatest exemplars of the revolutionary 1960s, a man whose heroic adventures were essential to the success of the Cuban Revolution and whose legend fired the imaginations of a whole generation. In 1965, amid worldwide conjecture, Guevara left Cuba, where he was a minister in Fidel Castro's postrevolutionary government, and traveled incognito to the heart of Africa. People's hero Patrice Lumumba had recently been assassinated, and Guevara was to put his theories of guerrilla warfare to use helping the oppressed people of the Congo throw off the yoke of colonial imperialism. The first task was to assist the young Laurent Kabila in his struggle against Mobutu and Tshombe, the two key figures in the newly independent nation. For the first time, The African Dream collects Guevara's unabridged journals of the expedition. They are the record of the bitter failure of a political and ideological dream, and a telling complement to the subsequent rise of Kabila and his recent demise. Most of all, the diaries afford the reader a very personal insight into the thoughts and emotions of Che Guevara, the twentieth century's great revolutionary martyr.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

","When residents of Boulder, Colorado, suddenly began to see mountain lions in their backyards, it became clear that the cats had returned after decades of bounty hunting had driven them far from human settlement. In a riveting environmental tale that has received huge national attention, journalist David Baron traces the history of the mountain lion and chronicles one town's tragic effort to coexist with its new neighbors. As thought-provoking as it is harrowing, The Beast in the Garden is a tale of nature corrupted, the clash between civilization and wildness, and the artificiality of the modern American landscape. It is, ultimately, a book about the future of our nation, where suburban sprawl and wildlife-protection laws are pushing people and wild animals into uncomfortable, sometimes deadly proximity.""Reads like a crime novel . . . each chapter ends on a cliff-hanging note.""Seattle Times",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Reprising the years-long, in-depth collaboration that produced much of National Geographic magazine's coverage of southern Africa, award-winning photographer Chris Johns and veteran foreign correspondent Peter Godwin present this important critical exploration of the region's myriad facets and its collisions between tradition and modernity, conservation and development, and people and animals. In evocative photographs and accompanying anecdotal text, Wild at Heart crisscrosses southern Africafrom the Kalahari Desert and Drakensburg Mountains to the Skeleton coast and Zambesi Riverto reveal its diverse populations and wildlife and highlight their often unacknowledged interdependence. Johns's superb photographs of wildlife, including cheetahs, rhinos, and elephants, and his sensitive portraits of Himba pastoralists, San Bushmen hunter-gatherers, Zulu farmers, and other populations are combined with Godwin's passionate, lyric stories that both entertain and enlighten. The result is a finely detailed yet panoramic image of southern Africa that underscores the indissoluble connections between all its elements and speculates on the prospects for a future based on understanding those connections. Beautifully presented in a unique, oversize format with a top-opening spine that allows gallery-quality presentation of the images, Wild at Heart is destined to become a classic.

    reviews
","A touching, brilliant, and groundbreaking biography of one of literary history's most famous couples, at once a dual biography, a history, and the portrait of a long and stormy marriage, William L. Shirer's new book - written in his ninth decade - explores the passionate, highly charged, and extraordinary lives of Leo and Sonya Tolstoy. It is a compelling illumination both of the nature of genius and of the universal problems of love, sex, and marriage - themes that Tolstoy played out in his great fiction and that haunted him in his tangled domestic life. Rich in anecdotes, wise, full of sweeping history, and imbued with Shirer's profound knowledge of literature and life, Love and Hatred ranks beside such works as Robert Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra and Nigel Nicolson's Portrait of a Marriage as a masterly, intuitive, and sympathetic exploration of the love/hate relationship between two famous, bigger-than-life people. Beginning in 1862, when Tolstoy committed the blunder of asking his young bride to read his diaries of his bachelor life so there should be no secrets between them, and ending with his tragic flight from home (and marriage) in 1910 while the whole world waited for news of him, Love and Hatred tells the story of a great romance between two people who could live neither together nor apart - a romance that exhausted and obsessed them both, and that forms the basis for much of Tolstoy's work. The final book of William L. Shirer's long and brilliant career, it is - appropriately - a masterly re-creation of a time, of two extraordinary people, and of the very nature of love, marriage, and old age.",Hardcover,,400 pages,"

In an amazing twenty-year journey around Central Asia, he was variously employed as surgeon to the Maharaja of Punjab, revolutionary agent for the exiled Afghan King, and then commander-in-chief of the Afghan armies. In 1838, he set off in the footsteps of Alexander the Great across the Hindu Kush and forged his own kingdom, only to be ejected from Afghanistan a few months later by the invading British.Using a trove of newly-discovered documents, Harlan's own unpublished journals, and with a revised Preface detailing the unexpected discovery of Harlan's descendents, Ben Macintyre's The Man Who Would Be King tells the astonishing tale of the man who would be the first and last American king.",Paperback,,368 pages,"

Wagner explores this fascinating aspect of his career by showing how his investigations were grounded in the cutting-edge science of his day, especially the emerging field of forensics.... Utterly compelling.""—Otto Penzler, member of the Baker Street Irregulars and proprietor of The Mysterious Bookshop""E. J. Wagner demonstrates that without the work of Sherlock Holmes and his contemporaries, the CSI teams would be twiddling their collective thumbs. Her accounts of Victorian crimes make Watson's tales pale! Highly recommended for students of the Master Detective.""—Leslie S. Klinger, Editor, The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes""In this thrilling book, E. J. Wagner has combined her considerable strengths in three disciplines to produce a work as compelling and blood-curdling as the best commercial fiction. This is CSI in foggy old London Town. Chilling, grim fun.""—John Westermann, author of Exit Wounds and Sweet Deal""I am recommending this delightful work to all of my fellow forensic scientists.... Bravo, Ms. Wagner!""—John Houde, author of Crime Lab: A Guide for Nonscientists""A fabulously interesting read. The book traces the birth of the forensic sciences to the ingenuity of Sherlock Holmes.

","The Book of Dede Korkut is a collection of twelve stories set in the heroic age of the Oghuz Turks, a nomadic tribe who had journeyed westwards through Central Asia from the ninth century onwards. The stories are peopled by characters as bizarre as they are unforgettable: Crazy Karchar, whose unpredictability requires an army of fleas to manage it; Kazan, who cheerfully pretends to necrophilia in order to escape from prison; the monster Goggle-eye; and the heroine Chichek, who shoots, races on horseback and wrestles her lover. Geoffrey Lewis's classic translation retains the odd and oddly appealing style of the stories, with their mixture of the colloquial, the poetic and the dignified, and magnificently conveys the way in which they bring to life a wild society and its inhabitants. This edition also includes an introduction, a map and explanatory notes.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","One of the oldest surviving pieces of Turkish literature, The Book of Dede Korkut can be traced to tenth-century origins. Now considered the national epic of Turkey, it is the heritage of the ancient Oghuz Turks and was composed as they migrated westward from their homeland in Central Asia to the Middle East, eventually to settle in Anatolia. Who its primary creator was no one knows, the titular bard, Dede Korkut, being more a symbol of Turkish minstrelsy than a verifiable author. The songs and tales of countless minstrels lay behind The Book of Dede Korkut, and in its oral form the epic was undoubtedly subject to frequent improvisation by individual performers. Partly in prose, partly in verse, these legends were sung or chanted in the courts and camps of political and military leaders. Even after they had been recorded in written form, they remained part of an oral tradition.The present edition is the first complete text in English. The translators provide an excellent introduction to the language and background of the legends as well as a history of Dede Korkut scholarship. These outstanding tales will be of interest to all students of world mythology and folklore.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewKevin J. Anderson's super-sized space opera, the Saga of Seven Suns, continues in Of Fire and Night, the fifth installment of the shelf-bending science fiction series that has been compared to Frank Herbert's Dune chronicles and Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. Of Fire and Night begins with the all-out extermination of humankind looming. The Terran Hanseatic League's war with the hydrogues (aliens that live at the core of gas-giant planets) is going badly -- and, with a tyrannical leader like Basil Wenceslas, the situation is only getting worse, especially after he alienates all of the powerful aliens who might have helped the League. As these once-reliable allies secretly plot humankind's eradication with the hydrogues, entire factions of humanity are making plans for individual survival. At the same time, Soldier compies (competent computerized companions) have rebelled and taken most of Earth's military. With Armageddon imminent, does humankind have any chance of survival? When Anderson's Saga of Seven Suns (Scattered Suns, Horizon Storms, et al.) is eventually concluded -- a projected seven-volume story arc, according to the author's web site -- it will be remembered as one of the most ambitious science fiction narratives ever undertaken. Featuring numerous sentient alien races, complex political machinations, mind-blowing technological advances, and literally hundreds of integral characters, this apocalyptic series can be described properly in only word -- epic! (A word of advice to Seven Suns neophytes: This is definitely not a series where readers can just pick up any volume and dive in. Beginning with Book One, Hidden Empire, is highly recommended.)

","More than 500 years of history are brought to life in this illustrated encyclopedia, whose panoramic scope offers a vivid, definitive chronology of the African-American experience. Black Saga is a remarkably comprehensive reference book that highlights the key issues and accomplishments of African American from the late fifteenth century through the present. The people, places, and events that created black America are presented in brief entries arranged in chronological order. Sidebar articles interspersed throughout the text analyze the demographic, social, economic, and political conditions that affected blacks-calling particular attention to the efforts of African Americans to win freedom, respect, and improved prospects for a promising future in a country that often took the most extreme measures to deny them basic rights.The four-century trajectory of Black Saga is punctuated with the accomplishments of famous figures and unsung heroes: the poetry of Phillis Wheatley, the music of William Still, the industrial inventions of Jan Matzeliger, the business acumen of Madame C. J. Walkre, the sensational plays and home runs of Jackie Robinson, the political skills and power of Adam Clayton Powell, and the movies of Spike Lee.Practical and attractive, Black Saga is a great sourcebook for students from high school through college, and a valuable addition to any home reference library.

","Simon, who is the narrator of this book, lets test-takers know that he's a cool college dude who's ready to help everybody get an incredibly fantastic score when they take the new, revised verbal skills section of the SAT. Simon tells students that college time is party time, but first, kids need to do some serious work. That includes expanding their vocabulary so they'll be able to cope with college-level reading assignments. He tells them, for instance: ""Well, it's time for you to get to work. You'd better get this pedestrian stuff out of the way, pronto, so we can get to know each other better. Hey, I know the thing looks a little daunting, but I think the meanings are quite explicit."" Certain words in that passage—for instance, pedestrian, daunting, and explicit—are set in boldface type. That is the students' signal to look up the word, understand what it means, and comprehend how it's being used in the sentence. Students who read all of Simon's commentaries and understand all boldface words are guaranteed to excel on the new SAT I Verbal. As Simon helps students expand their word power, he finds something to say about most topics that interest college kids—from girls and parties to coping with term papers and doing library research. A short quiz follows each episode. Here's a unique, refreshing approach to vocabulary building for high school students preparing for the all-important college entrance test.",Paperback,,464 pages,"

","This compelling Icelandic history describes the life of King Harald Hardradi, from his battles across Europe and Russia to his final assault on England in 1066, less than three weeks before the invasion of William the Conqueror. It was a battle that led to his death and marked the end of an era in which Europe had been dominated by the threat of Scandinavian forces. Despite England's triumph, it also played a crucial part in fatally weakening the English army immediately prior to the Norman Conquest, changing the course of history. Taken from the Heimskringla - Snorri Sturluson's complete account of Norway from prehistoric times to 1177 - this is a brilliantly human depiction of the turbulent life and savage death of the last great Norse warrior-king.",Hardcover,,180 pages,"

","As the practical application of ecological restoration continues to grow, there is an increasing need to connect restoration practice to areas of underlying ecological theory. Foundations of Restoration Ecology is an important milestone in the field, bringing together leading ecologists to bridge the gap between theory and practice by translating elements of ecological theory and current research themes into a scientific framework for the field of restoration ecology.Each chapter addresses a particular area of ecological theory, covering traditional levels of biological hierarchy (such as population genetics, demography, community ecology) as well as topics of central relevance to the challenges of restoration ecology (such as species interactions, fine-scale heterogeneity, successional trajectories, invasive species ecology, ecophysiology). Several chapters focus on research tools (research design, statistical analysis, modeling), or place restoration ecology research in a larger context (large-scale ecological phenomena, macroecology, climate change and paleoecology, evolutionary ecology).The book makes a compelling case that a stronger connection between ecological theory and the science of restoration ecology will be mutually beneficial for both fields: restoration ecology benefits from a stronger grounding in basic theory, while ecological theory benefits from the unique opportunities for experimentation in a restoration context.Foundations of Restoration Ecology advances the science behind the practice of restoring ecosystems while exploring ways in which restoration ecology can inform basic ecological questions. It provides the first comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations of restoration ecology, and is a must-have volume for anyone involved in restoration research, teaching, or practice.",Paperback,,384 pages,"

","This provocative volume explores the origins of the Jewish doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. Jon D. Levenson argues that, contrary to a very widespread misconception, the ancient rabbis were keenly committed to the belief that at the end of time, God would restore the deserving dead to life. In fact, Levenson points out, the rabbis saw the Hebrew Bible itself as committed to that idea.The author meticulously traces the belief in resurrection backward from its undoubted attestations in rabbinic literature and in the Book of Daniel, showing where the belief stands in continuity with earlier Israelite culture and where it departs from that culture. Focusing on the biblical roots of resurrection, Levenson challenges the notion that it was a foreign import into Judaism, and in the process he develops a neglected continuity between Judaism and Christianity. His book will shake the thinking of scholars and lay readers alike, revising the way we understand the history of Jewish ideas about life, death, and the destiny of the Jewish people.",Hardcover,,304 pages,"

When it comes to the opposite sex, however, she's baffled enough to choose early retirement from the dating game. It's not that she hates men, it's just that she doesn't trust them. After all, her soon-to-be ex-husband has dropped all contact with their son, and her own father disappeared from her life thirty years ago. And then Kat meets Magnus Grimmson, a tall, good-looking, tongue-tied Icelander in the front row of her class. Magnus doesn't appear to pose any threat -- in fact, he seems to understand less about women than Kat does about men. But just when Kat considers risking a little intimacy, her father reappears in her life, causing unexpected complications. Emotionally torn, Kat is left to question whom she can trust -- and to realize that she still has a lot to learn about men and the kind of communication they don't teach in school.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Jeanne Sauv? has led a remarkable life. Born in the small community of Prud'homme in Saskatchewan, raised in Ottawa attending a convent school, she fought to get the education she required. She went on to work as a youth organiser, journalist and politician--becoming a member of the small circle of French Canadian intellectuals who had an enormous influence on Canadian public life in the 1960s and '70s. She capped her career with a stormy session as the first woman speaker of the House of Commons--and then, after facing the threat of imminent death from serious illness, she became Canada's first woman Governor General. ""Her Excellency Jeanne Sauv?"" is the reamarkable and inspirational story of the journalist, mother and politician who became Canada's Covernor General.",Paperback,,246 pages,"

","James Gray was an outspoken, engaging journalist for more than twenty years before he turned to writing books. Soon he became Western Canada's best-loved historian, author of the classic popular histories Booze, The Winter Years and Red Lights on the Prairies. This book takes us from the depths of the Depression to the heady days of the post-war boom in the Fifties. Gray had a knack for being in the right place at the right time: covering the Turner Valley oil discoveries in 1936-7, the battle by women to get into the armed forces in 1940, and the influx of American oilmen into Alberta's oil and gas industry after the war. With his dislike of hypocrisy, and his compassion for people of all kinds, Gray is a fine and honest reporter. The same qualities make ""Troublemaker "" a fine and honest book.",Paperback,,315 pages,"

","Winner of the 2002 Kiriyama Prize in NonfictionThe astonishing story of a young man's upbringing in a remote tribal village in Burma and his journey from his strife-torn country to the tranquil quads of Cambridge. In lyrical prose, Pascal Khoo Thwe describes his childhood as a member of the Padaung hill tribe, where ancestor worship and communion with spirits blended with the tribe's recent conversion to Christianity. In the 1930s, Pascal's grandfather captured an Italian Jesuit, mistaking him for a giant or a wild beast; the Jesuit in turn converted the tribe. (The Padaung are famous for their 'giraffe women' -- so-called because their necks are ritually elongated with ornamental copper rings. Pascal's grandmother had been exhibited in a touring circus in England as a 'freak'.) Pascal developed a love of the English language through listening to the BBC World Service, and it was while working as a waiter in Mandalay to pay for his studies that he met the Cambridge don John Casey, who was to prove his saviour. The brutal military regime of Ne Win cracked down on 'dissidents' in the late 1980s. Pascal's girlfriend was raped and murdered by soldiers, and Pascal took to the jungle with a guerrilla army. How he was eventually rescued with Casey's help is a dramatic story, which ends with his admission to Cambridge to study his great love, English literature",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","In each of these tales Margaret Atwood deftly illuminates the single instant that shapes a whole life: in a few brief pages we watch as characters progress from the vulnerabilities of adolescence through the passions of youth into the precarious complexities of middle age.  By superimposing the past on the present, Atwood paints interior landscapes shaped by time, regret, and life's lost chances, endowing even the banal with a sense of mystery.  Richly layered and disturbing, poignant at times and scathingly witty at others, the stories in Wilderness Tips take us into the strange and secret places of the heart and inform the familiar world in which we live with truths that cut to the bone.Contents:True trash --Hairball --Isis in darkness --The bog man --Death by landscape --Uncles --The age of lead --Weight --Wilderness tips --Hack Wednesday.",Paperback,,228 pages,"

","Since the mid-1980s, telecommunications and information technologies (IT) have become more intensely bound up than ever before in the social, economic, political and cultural processes and transformations which are increasingly concentrated in and between key strategic urban places across the globe. By analysing telecommunications developments in Paris and London, this book offers an explicit comparative and cross-national approach to the development of urban telecommunications infrastructures and to the development of global cities through a focus on these crucial infrastructures. engagement with the most relevant and recent debates and theories in urban studies, geography and planning. By examining differing, but parallel influences of national, urban and local contexts, processes and practices bound up in telecommunications developments, the book firmly underlines the inherently territorial basis of these developments and their multi-scalar elements and implications, all of which are being reinforced by the current stringent strategic retrenching of telecommunications operations around the globe.",Unknown Binding,,339 pages,"

","A unique and important book for historians in religion, women's studies, public health, and English history. A rare devotional text written in 1646 during an outbreak of bubonic plague. When a ""gentlewoman of his acquaintance"" complained that few devotional works were written by Protestants for women, John Featly, the exiled chaplain of King Charles I, wrote this in the voice of a woman seeking spiritual solace for seemingly inevitable holocaust. When the ""Great Plague"" struck London in 1665, someone known only as ""S.K."" had Featly's book reprinted for his (or her?) generation. It may have been an act of religious solidarity, or it may have been a profit venture. In this work, Featly offers pastoral counsel to the woman shut up in her house by quarantine. The authorities often marked red crosses on houses whose inhabitants had plague, to warn the community. Others quarantined themselves, fearing public contagion. Featly's comfort takes the form of an extended treatise on sin, mourning and redemptive tears, a homiletic approach common in his day.",Paperback,,122 pages,"

The first half is a carefully researched, day-by-day recreation of the raid by Rogers' Rangers on the Indian village at Saint-François-du-Lac, Quebec (or Saint Francis, to the Americans troops), a settlement of the Abenakis, an American Indian tribe. The second half of the novel covers Rogers' later life in London, England and Fort Michilimackinac, Michigan.

Yet an even greater territory with an even more inhospitable climate rests to the North in what is now Canada. Rupert's Land was a vast expanse held by the Hudson Bay Company under a charter issued by the British Crown. It is amongst these beautiful and harsh lands surrounding the Hudson Bay that this great epic unfolds. After Fort Newcastle is brutally captured by invading French mercenaries, Charles Lord and a band of his surviving soldiers, trackers, and explorers embark on one last great adventure to unite the people of Rupert's Land to reclaim their home.

","The Northwest Passage is so far north that only a polar projection map presents an accurate picture of its expanse. It has been both an integral part of Canada's national identity and a source of contention between the United States and Canada. Canadian claims that the Passage is internal Canadian waters have been challenged by United States insistence that it is an international strait. Continental partners and allies, the two countries have charted a unique course in continental cooperation, while concurrently working to resolve contentious bilateral issues. This study places the Northwest Passage in the context of U.S.-Canadian relations and argues that its resolution lies in the spirit and history of bilateral cooperation found in the second half of the twentieth century.",Hardcover,,225 pages,"

","When Lewis and Clark reached the Columbia River in 1805, they found a roaring and unruly river with a treacherous mouth and confusing course, boasting salmon runs without equal in the world. William Dietrich, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author of The Final Forest, reveals the heroic stories, triumphant engineering, and disturbing taming of this powerful, beautiful river. Northwest Passage is a masterwork of history, geography, and science, a sweeping overview of the transformation of the Columbia from its geologic origins and aboriginal inhabitants to its pioneers, settlers, dam builders, farmers, and contemporary native Americans. The Columbia is the second largest river, by volume, in the U.S. and the largest on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. Its terrain varies from rain forests with more than 100 inches of precipitation a year to desert with as little as 5 inches per year. It was once the most inexhaustible of rivers with as many as 16 million fish pushing up its 1,200-mile length each year to spawn and die in its hundreds of tributaries, a run supporting one of the most populous and complex native cultures on the continent. Before the European discovery of the Columbia River, dreaming merchants and intrepid explorers risked their lives and their money to find the entrance to and navigate the wildly unpredictable course of this ""Great River of the West."" Native Americans clung to the Columbia as the root of their culture, colonizers came in search of productive land and an efficient trade route, and industrialists seeking energy transformed the region's wild beauty. The Columbia of today is a product of its yesterdays. It is docile, run by engineers and turned onand off by valves with fourteen major dams on the river and more than 500 in its basin. The obstacle course of falls, boulders, whirlpools, and floods has been harnessed and provides 70 percent of the Northwest's energy.

","A riveting true adventure story….An award-winning, bestselling author…A page-turner that’s impossible to put down. Almost everyone knows the photo of John F. Kennedy, Jr., as a young boy, peering out from under his father’s desk in the Oval Office. But few realize that the desk itself plays a part in one of the world’s most extraordinary mysteries—a dramatic tale that has never before been told in its full scope. Acclaimed historian Martin Sandler—a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee, winner of seven Emmy® Awards, and author of more than 50 books—finally brings the entire story to light. This amazing high-seas adventure encompasses the search for the Northwest Passage in the early 1800s; a renowned explorer and his crew of 128 men who vanish during an 1845 expedition; 39 incredible, heroic attempted rescue missions; a ghost ship that drifts for more than 1,200 miles; a queen’s gratitude; and that famous desk. Fascinating rare photographs, paintings, engravings, and maps illustrate the book throughout.It all began when, in one of the biggest news stories of the 19th century, Sir John Franklin and his ships the Erebus and the Terror disappeared while attempting to locate the fabled Northwest Passage. At the request of Franklin’s wife, Lady Jane, the first mission set out from England in hopes of finding him; many others followed in its wake, none successful.Among these was the Resolute, the finest vessel in Queen Victoria’s Navy. But in 1854 it became locked in Arctic ice and was abandoned by its captain. A year later, a Connecticut whaler discovered it 1,200 miles away—drifting and deserted, a 600-ton ghost ship. He and his small crew boarded the Resolute, and steered it through a ferocious hurricane back to New London, Connecticut. The United States government then reoutfitted the ship and returned it to the thankful Queen. In 1879, when the Resolute was finally retired, she had the best timbers made into a desk for then-President Rutherford B. Hayes. It is still used by U.S. presidents today...one of the most celebrated pieces of furniture in the White House.",Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","The eighteenth century—the Age of Reason—was characterized by determined attempts by philosophers, scientists, and political theorists to dispel myth, superstition, and ignorance. But the Age of Reason also witnessed some of the most irrational and vainglorious attempts by sailors and speculators to find a navigable Northwest Passage that would lead through the icy seas of the Arctic from Hudson Bay to the wealth of the Pacific Ocean. Lured by the promise of fame and riches, men endured paralyzing cold, malnutrition, and terrifying storms. Many lives and fortunes were lost in the quest for the elusive ""maritime philosopher’s stone.""In this gripping work of narrative history, Glyn Williams describes the adventures and mishaps of these misguided expeditions. Vividly written and replete with fascinating characters, Voyages of Delusion is a riveting contribution to the history of North American exploration.",Hardcover,,496 pages,"

","In our universe, a Cardassian sleeper agent--Iliana Ghemor--was once surgically altered to resemble and replace resistance fighter Kira Nerys, future Starfleet captain and hero of the planet Bajor's liberation. That plan never reached fruition, and the fate of the agent remained unknown...until now.Robbed of the past sixteen years, Iliana Ghemor is back with a vengeance. Over a decade and a half of imprisonment and abuse by her former masters has brought her to the brink of madness, sustained only by the twisted belief that she is, in fact, the real Kira Nerys. She has already made one near-successful attempt on the real Kira's life, but instead of assuming the identity of the woman she was intended to replace, Ghemor has set her sights on the most unexpected target of all: Kira's other double, the malicious Intendent, Bajor's iron-fisted ruler in the alternate reality commonly known as the ""Mirror Universe."" But far more is unfolding in the Mirror Universe than Ghemor realizes, and the heroes of Deep Space Nine somehow must stop the false Kira without derailing the delicate flow of history that must unfold if both universes, and countless others, are to survive.Parallel stories set in both universes reflect and build upon each other in this Two-in-One ""Flip Book,"" the continuation of both the ongoing DS9 saga as well as the Mirror Universe line of books.",,,,,"['Media', 'Science', 'Star', 'Fiction']"

","UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF TEROK NOR! It was once a battered Cardassian ore-processing facility orbiting the planet Bajor. But Terok Nor took on new life when the Cardassians evacuated and were replaced by Starfleet personnel. With the discovery of a nearby stable wormhole connecting the Alpha Quadrant with the Gamma Quadrant, the newly christened Space Station Deep Space 9 became one of the most important installations in known space. Filled with hundreds of schematic diagrams and illustrations, the ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual"" is essential for anyone interested in the ships, technology and weapons of Starfleet and the many different species, who frequent the station, including the Klingons, the Bajorans, the Romulans, the Cardassians, and the Jem'Hadar. As an added bonus, four full-color gatefolds have been specially created for this book. In addition to providing an in-depth look at the exteriors of the station, these illustrations also show the Promenade, and highlight the U.S.S. Defiant. Turning the ravaged outpost into a fully operational station involved much more than a simple name change. The transformation represented an arduous challenge to the Starfleet engineers who were required to merge two divergent technologies. How they achieved that feat, and how the Federation helps the Bajoran government keep the station running smoothly, is revealed in the ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual"".",Paperback,,192 pages,"

","Dreams and Destinies, the Rosetta Stone of Marguerite Yourcenar's canon, is an intimate journal of her dreams. In Dreams and Destinies Yourcenar has provided us with the most daring, yet least conventional form of autobiography, a form that allows the reader to view her life refracted through the poetic sensibility of her own sleeping mind. In recording her dream life, Yourcenar wanders through a picture gallery of the soul, pausing before ruined cathedrals filled with candles, dark ravines that hold dead bodies, and still reflecting pools located deep inside soaring gothic churches. Her dreams are populated by men, women, and children as well as animals and mythical creatures. Available for the first time in English in the way that she intended upon her death, Dreams and Destinies is a reminder from one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century that the dreams we create are with us forever.",Hardcover,,160 pages,"

","Complete dustjacket description (1976 FSG hardcover edition):Marguerite Yourcenar's novel of sixteenth century Europe is, like Memoirs of Hadrian, essentially a meditation on the nature and condition of man. But unlike the Hadrian it is direct narrative, and is somber, even bitter in tone, portraying the struggle of a free mind in highly troubled times. The principal character, Zeno, typical of the leading intellectuals of his day in the wide range of his studies and activities, is botanist and physician, alchemist, engineer, metallurgist, and philosopher. In advance of the recognized science of his era, forced perpetually to thread his way between compromise and revolt, he is akin to his great historical contemporaries and near-contemporaries, the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus, the Spaniard Servetus, preoccupied like Zeno with studies of circulation of the blood, the Leonardo of the Notebooks, with their experiments and secret meditations, and that audacious but unlucky philosopher, Tommaso Campanella.Born in Flanders, the illegitimate son of an Italian prelate, and reared in the household of his wealthy merchant uncle, Henry Justus Lire of Bruges, Zeno is destined for the Church, but he early abandons his theological studies in Louvain to seek for knowledge untrammeled by doctrine. Drawn to the subversive dynamism of medieval alchemy, he pursues that science host under the auspices of a high churchman in Ghent, and next with a learned jew of Leon, in Spain. He then goes to France to study medicine and anatomy at the ancient college of Montpellier. The practice of his various arts takes him across Europe and the Levant attending sometimes upon sultans and kings, and some times upon the poor and the plague-ridden, everywhere in danger in a world torn by war, and by religious and social upheaval. Often a target for jealous colleagues, he is suspect for the daring of his experiments, for his writings, and for his barely avowed atheism.After the burning of one of his books in Paris, following censorship in Basel, that is to say, attacked by Catholics and Protestants alike, Zeno risks a return to Bruges for the first time in more than thirty years. Under an assumed name, Sebastian Théus, he carries on a charitable practice in the dispensary of a Franciscan monastery, the prior of which becomes a friend and, unknown to Zeno, a protector.Certain secondary themes provide a muted counterpoint to the main theme of philosophic and alchemical quest: the power of gold or other wealth in the hands of merchants and financiers in the German States and in Flanders; religious revolt that sweeps Zeno's mother and his stepfather, Simon Adriansen, into the whirlpool of Anabaptism; the more secret revolt against restrictions imposed upon the senses, bringing a small group of monks and novices in Bruges to destruction; and political revolt in Spanish Flanders under Philip II, filling the roads with Patriots in flight toward England and the Netherlands. The same dilemmas and the same moral anguish which beset us still today are presented here for the years 1510-1569 as seen realistically from the perspective of the highway, the laboratory, the cloister, shop, or tavern, and finally as seen from prison.Both as physician and as philosopher Zeno seeks to comprehend the very components of body and soul, tracing substance itself to its particles moving in time and in space. The mental experiment is dangerous, as the ancient alchemists knew, it involves destruction of all preconceived ideas and prejudices, even the notion of the self, and constitutes the first and most difficult phase of the Great Transmutation, the Black Phase of the Process (from which the French text takes its title, L'Oeuvre au Noir). By the intensity of his experience, both physical and spiritual, Zeno achieves his goal, even though his unquenchable desire to explore the confines of this our prison brings the inevitable confrontation that leads to his death.No living writer can quite compare with Marguerite Yourcenar in intellectual richness and range of human sympathy. In its adherence to historic and human truth the novel is overwhelming.",Paperback,,374 pages,"

","Marguerite Yourcenar was born Marguerite de Crayencour in Brussels in 1903. She lost her mother at birth, her native Belgium at the age of six, and was forced to flee her adopted France at twelve. It is little wonder that Yourcenar, whose own early past receded so quickly into personal legend, would one day describe her writing as the ""passionate reconstitution , at once detailed and free, of a moment or a man out of the past."" One of the most respected writers in the French language, best known as the author of Memoirs of Hadrian and The Abyss, she was awarded countless literary honors, culminating with her election in 1980 to the Académie Française (she was the first woman ever to be so honored). As complex, erudite, and intriguing as her work, Yourcenar's life has resisted its own passionate reconstitution until now, in part because of the writer's deliberate elusiveness, even in her autobiographical trilogy.Here, in its intricate and often contradictory detail, is Marguerite Yourcenar's story, one in which loss and learning intertwined almost from the first and in which love assumed a strangely paradoxical place. Drawing on letters, diaries, and interviews with Yourcenar's friends, colleagues, and lovers, Josyane Savigneau's biography paints an intimate portrait of an artist who lived according to her own, occasionally contrary, terms: a Frenchwoman ardently in love with her native tongue, yet who lived half her life in New England; an avid seductress of women, who spent nearly forty years with one woman, yet fell in love early and late in her life with two young men; a powerful female writer whose most memorable protagonists were male, from Alexis of her first novel to the later historical characters Hadrian and Zeno. Savigneau weaves these and other contraries of Yourcenar's life into a vibrant and engrossing pattern.Editor of ""Le Monde des Livres,"" the literary pages of France's most influential newspaper, Savigneau first met Marguerite Yourcenar on assignment in 1984. What began as a professional relationship gradually turned into a friendship. Her personal insights into that life enrich this exhaustively documented text. Following the lead set by Yourcenar in her memoir Dear Departed, the biographer found herself ""searching for a truth that is multiple, unstable, evasive, sometimes saddening, and at first glance scandalous but that one cannot approach without often feeling for human beings in all their frailty a certain measure of kinship and, always, a sense of pity."" Yourcenar's profound intelligence and sympathy, her foibles and obsessions, her accomplishments and trials: all are revealed here in an uncompromising portrait of an incomparable artist.",Hardcover,,503 pages,"

","In ""To America,"" Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world.Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons.Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebratesthe unflappable American spirit.Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. ""The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.""""To America"" is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.",Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Homeland Security: A Documentary History provides a rich and relevant exploration of the concept of ""homeland security"" throughout the nation's history, leading up to an examination of the new Homeland Security Department and its mission and impact. This essential reference was recently selected as one of the Best Reference Works of 2005 by the New York Public Library System.The Homeland Security Department was created in 2002 and involved the largest restructuring of the federal government in over forty years. Yet American institutions and officials have responded to homeland security issues throughout the life of the nation, for example, with the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. Homeland Security explores the concept and challenges of homeland security through government reports, budget proposals, public affairs campaigns and press releases, speeches, testimony, and other primary sources.Themes covered include:Historical homeland security issues and responses Process for creating a new executive department and changing institutions and bureaucracies Steps, major debates, and events leading up to the creation of the Department Impact on governmental institutions and employees, such as Congress and its committees and structure, federal and state bureaucracies, and civil servants Budgetary implications at the federal and state levels Challenges and ramifications for citizens and civil liberties Missions and goals, such as aviation and border security, crisis planning, and citizen preparedness. Supplemented with a chronology, print and web resource list, and an index, Homeland Security is unique in exploring historical antecedents as well as the Department's impact on political institutions and the ways Americans live and govern. Perfect for undergraduates in political science and journalism programs, AP Social Studies students, and public library patrons.",Hardcover,,512 pages,"

Here are American families who can no longer pay their medical bills, who've lost high-wage-earning jobs to NAFTA. And here are white supremacists who claim common ground with progressives. Maharidge's approach is rigorously historical, creating a tapestry of today as it is lived in America, a self-portrait that is shockingly different from what we're used to seeing and yet which rings of truth.",Hardcover,,296 pages,"

","A stunning account of life behind bars at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, where the nation's hardest criminals do hard time. ""A page-turner, as compelling and evocative as the finest novel. The best book on prison I've ever read.""--Jonathan Kellerman  The most dreaded facility in the prison system because of its fierce population, Leavenworth is governed by ruthless clans competing for dominance. Among the ""star"" players in these pages: Carl Cletus Bowles, the sexual predator with a talent for murder; Dallas Scott, a gang member who has spent almost thirty of his forty-two years behind bars; indomitable Warden Robert Matthews, who put his shoulder against his prison's grim reality; Thomas Silverstein, a sociopath confined in ""no human contact"" status since 1983; ""tough cop"" guard Eddie Geouge, the only officer in the penitentiary with the authority to sentence an inmate to ""the Hole""; and William Post, a bank robber with a criminal record going back to when he was eight years old--and known as the ""Catman"" for his devoted care of the cats who live inside the prison walls.Pete Earley, celebrated reporter and author of Family of Spies, all but lived for nearly two years inside the primordial world of Leavenworth, where he conducted hundreds of interviews. Out of this unique, extraordinary access comes the riveting story of what life is actually like in the oldest maximum-security prison in the country.Praise for The Hot House""Reporting at its very finest.""--Los Angeles Times""The book is a large act of courage, its subject an important one, and . . . Earley does it justice.""--The Washington Post Book World""[A] riveting, fiercely unsentimental book . . . To [Earley's] credit, he does not romanticize the keepers or the criminals. His cool and concise prose style serves him well. . . . This is a gutsy book.""--Chicago Tribune""Harrowing . . . an exceptional work of journalism.""--Detroit Free Press""If you're going to read any book about prison, The Hot House is the one. . . .

This revised and updated paperback edition also deals with the Barings crisis and the report by the Bank of England on Barings Bank; up-to-date information on the state of Japanese banking; changes in the financial scene in the US; the UK housing market and the problem of negative equity. The paradox of why more coins than ever before are required in an increasingly cashless society is clearly explained, as is the role of the new `Euro' coin as the lowest common denominator in Europe's controversial single currency system. The final section provides evidence to suggest that for most of the world's richer countries the era of persistent inflation may well be at an end.",Paperback,,720 pages,"

","""Money: A History"" examines the origins, spread and cultural diversity of money throughout the world. From the exchange systems of earliest times to the increasingly cashless society of today, money and currency is set against a background of broader issues such as moral, political and religious attitudes to money in different cultures. Coin specialists from the British Museum trace the development of monetary systems from the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt to the invention of coinage in Lydia in the 7th century BC and its dissemination throughout the Greek and Roman empires. They consider money in the medieval West and the Islamic lands, in the ancient civilizations of India and China, and in the early modern period in the West. The book also examines the consequences of the globalization of the world monetary economy in the 19th and 20th centuries from more than a purely Western perspective.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The dramatic story of greed, money, power, and the moguls and dynasties that have shaped business From merchant ships to microchips, industry has been defined by the powerful business leaders who have caused seismic shifts in the growth of commerce. The companion book to the acclaimed CNBC documentary, Money and Power takes readers on a gripping journey following the movement of power from east to west-from the feudal estates of medieval Europe to the halls of modern finance, from the teeming streets of ancient Venice to the serene campuses of Silicon Valley-to tell the story of how business shaped the modern world, and how the goals of a few ambitious people paved the way to the wealth and prosperity shared by so much of the world's population today.A dramatic narrative focusing on the groundbreakers throughout history-from St. Godric, the twelfth-century monk reviled for his love of money to Bill Gates, the contemporary embodiment of money and power-traces the roots of banking, industry, commerce, and power. Fever-pitch moments in the book center around pivotal figures such as Cosimo de Medici, Philip II, the Rothschilds, J. P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, Henry Ford and others. The authors also extract important lessons about the strategies and tactics used to build these business empires.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","L'argent. Dinero. Geld. Dough. Whatever you call it, money makes the world go round. The United States is dispensing its first redesigned bills in decades, and the Euro is on the brink of unifying European notes. It's the perfect time for this visual tour of the world's currencies. The various people, places, animals, and historical events depicted on money reflect how countries see themselves—and how they want the rest of world to see them. Author David Standish begins with a brief, fascinating history of currency, and then presents a striking gallery of international bills from more than 80 countries that corner the market on visual flair. The cast of characters on these small canvases is vast—from the Little Prince on French currency to the furry denizens of the rainforest of Madagascar to the obscure Salmon P. Chase, Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State, on the $10,000 US note (did you know that the US Secret Service originated with Lincoln's efforts to curb counterfeiting during the Civil War?). The Art of Money is an entertaining and lustrous tour of cash for design aficionados, history buffs, travelers, and everybody who handles money (or dreams of handling more).",Paperback,,132 pages,"

","What do Michael Milken and Martha Stewart have in common? (Answer: Both became public scapegoats for an outrageous era of greed and excess.) What was the most outrageous party thrown by a financial baron of the twentieth century? (Answer: Tough call, but either Michael Milken's Predators Ball in 1985, or Dennis Kozlowski's Sardinian birthday bash in 2001, with its vodka-spouting sculpture.) Which U.S. war hero president became party to, and victim of, an unabashed con man known as the Napoleon of Wall Street? (Answer: Ulysses S. Grant, but it's a long story.)These questions and more are discussed in Scott MacDonald and Jane Hughes' Separating Fools from Their Money. The authors trace the history of financial scandals from the early days of the young republic through the Enron/WorldCom debacle of modern times. A host of colorful characters inhabit the pages of this history, revealing human nature in all of its dubious shades of gray. At the same time, the book exposes themes common to all financial scandals, which remain astonishingly unchanged over more than two centuries--greed, hubris, media connections, self-interested politicians, and booms-gone-bust, to name a few.Informative and entertaining, Separating Fools should engage the interest of investors and casual business readers, as well as economists interested in supplemental reading for their students.",Hardcover,,264 pages,"

","In Indian Givers and Native Roots, renowned anthropologist Jack Weatherford opened the eyes of tens of thousands of readers to the clash between Native American and European cultures. Now, in his brilliant new book, Weatherford broadens his focus to examine how civilization threatens to obliterate unique tribal and ethnic cultures around the world -- and in the process imperils its own existence.As Weatherford explains, the relationship between ""civilized"" and ""savage"" peoples through history has encompassed not only violence, but also a surprising degree of cooperation, mutual influence, trade, and intermarriage. But this relationship has now entered a critical stage everywhere in the world, as indigenous peoples fiercely resist the onslaught of a global civilization that will obliterate their identities. Savages and Civilization powerfully demonstrates that our survival as a species is based not on a choice between savages and civilization, but rather on a commitment to their vital coexistence.",Paperback,,320 pages,"

","The bestselling author of Stones from the River delivers her most ambitious and dramatic novel yet -- the unforgettable story of an endearing, but also flawed, Italian American family.  In December 1953 Anthony Amedeo's world is nested in his Bronx neighborhood, his parents' Studebaker, the Paradise Theater, Yankee Stadium -- and in his imagination, where he longs for a stencil kit to decorate the windows like all the other kids on his street. Instead he gets a very different present: his uncle Malcolm's family.  Malcolm is in jail for stealing -- once again -- from his last new job, and Anthony's aunt and twin cousins settle into the Amedeos' fifth-floor walk-up. Sharing a room with girls is excruciating for Anthony, despite his affinity for the twins. But the real change in Anthony's life comes one evening when he causes the unthinkable to happen, changing each family member's life forever.  Evoking all the plenty and optimism of postwar America, Sacred Time spans three generations, taking us from the Bronx of the 1950s to contemporary Brooklyn. Keenly observing the dark side of family as well as its gracefulness, Hegi has outdone herself with this captivating novel about childhood's tenderness and the landscape of loneliness. Ultimately she reveals how the transforming power of a singular event can reverberate through a family for generations. With gravity and poise, Hegi turns her astute yet forgiving eye on the essential frailty and dignity of the human condition in this elegant and fast-paced novel.",Paperback,,240 pages,"

Once there, Lincoln is overwhelmed by autograph hounds and high suspicions. And when sudden perils cross his path and murder makes a horrific appearance, Lincoln, the actor-turned-investigator, is plunged into a plot of gold, greed, and gilded lives.

","A classic mystery from Dick Francis, the champion of English storytellers. Champion jockey Sid Halley retired from racing when his hand was smashed in a fall. Now he works as a private detective - which is proving to be no less dangerous to life and limb. Recuperating from a bullet wound, Sid is asked by his father-in-law to look into some potentially shady activity involving Seabury racecourse and a ruthless property dealer. But the closer Sid gets to those determined to get their hands on Seabury, the more he finds himself in harm's way. The odds are against him - but that's exactly when Sid is at his best...

","'Many articles have been written about the causes of financial crises in emerging markets... ...Much less attention has been devoted to the effectiveness of alternative policy responses and the ensuing process of recovery of the real economy...' This paper analyzes the adjustment process in the aftermath of speculative attacks in six countries: Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand. As implied by the title, the main question to be addressed is whether the tales of adjustment in these Latin American and Asian economies were similar. This comparison is interesting for several reasons. The six countries came under the aegis of adjustment programs supported by international financial institutions, and the associated policy prescriptions have been at the center of attention. Of the six cases, one is an example of a 'successful' defense of the currency, while another exemplifies a temporarily successful defense followed by an incomplete adjustment program. The others experienced dramatic currency devaluations. This small sample of episodes of adjustment also offers variety in the magnitude of the ensuing economic decline. While the Mexican and Argentine crises of 1995, and even the Brazilian adjustment after the October 1997 attack against its currency, were certainly costly, the Asian crises have been deeper and the recovery of the real economy has been slower. The paper draws policy implications for reducing the costs of the macroeconomic adjustment after currency crises.",Paperback,,52 pages,"

","A classic mystery from Dick Francis, the champion of English storytellers. As an amateur jockey, Roland Britten was lucky, and as an accountant he was rigorous. He knew he was on the hate list of several fraudsters, but never thought pen-pushers got kidnapped. And not from a racecourse right after beating the odds to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Held prisoner, Britten has no idea who his kidnappers are nor why they have abducted him. Only when resourceful school headmistress Hilary Pinlock gives him the opportunity to escape is he able to seriously think about what has happened and turn his logical mind to track down his abductors. But his kidnappers haven't finished with him yet - and they'll risk anything to get hold of him once again . . .

One of the blue bloods is destined to compete in the games and there are concerns - both of safety and of scandal - that only Drew, with his racing connections, can clear up. On arriving - speaking no Russian and wishing he were back home - Drew is supposed to identify and contact one Alyosha to clear up the scandal. Instead, he finds himself tailed by the KGB and embroiled in foiling a terrorist plot - or die trying. Home seems an awful long way away - and if he's not careful, he'll be going back in a box . . . Praise for Dick Francis: 'As a jockey, Dick Francis was unbeatable when he got into his stride. The same is true of his crime writing' Daily Mirror 'Dick Francis's fiction has a secret ingredient - his inimitable knack of grabbing the reader's attention on page one and holding it tight until the very end' Sunday Telegraph 'The narrative is brisk and gripping and the background researched with care . . . the entire story is a pleasure to relish' Scotsman 'Francis writing at his best' Evening Standard 'A regular winner . . . as smooth, swift and lean as ever' Sunday Express Dick Francis was one of the most successful post-war National Hunt jockeys. The winner of over 350 races, he was champion jockey in 1953/1954 and rode for HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, most famously on Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National. On his retirement from the saddle, he published his autobiography, The Sport of Queens, before going on to write forty-three bestselling novels, a volume of short stories (Field of 13), and the biography of Lester Piggott. During his lifetime Dick Francis received many awards, amongst them the prestigious Crime Writers' Association's Cartier Diamond Dagger for his outstanding contribution to the genre, and three 'best novel' Edgar Allan Poe awards from The Mystery Writers of America. In 1996 he was named by them as Grand Master for a lifetime's achievement. In 1998 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 2000. Dick Francis died in February 2010, at the age of eighty-nine, but he remains one of the greatest thriller writers of all time.",Hardcover,,,"

","“The thought . . . called up the flavors of an elaborate and bold cuisine, bent on making the flavors’ highest notes vibrate, juxtaposing them in modulations, in chords, and especially in dissonances that would assert themselves as an incomparable experience.” — From Under the Jaguar Sun   These intoxicating stories delve down to the core of our senses. Taste, hearing, and smell. Amid the flavors of Mexico’s fiery chilies and spices, a couple on holiday discovers dark truths about the maturing of desire in the title story, “Under the Jaguar Sun.” In “A King Listens,” a gripping portrait of a frenzied mind, the menacing echoes in a huge palace spur a tyrant’s thoughts to the heights of paranoid intensity. “The Name, the Nose” drives to a startling conclusion as men across time and space pursue the women whose aromas have enchanted them. Mordant and deliciously offbeat, this trio of tales is a treat from a master of short fiction. “[Calvino is] a learned, daring, ingeniously gifted magus . . . Under the Jaguar Sun . . . fuses fable with neuron . . . The reader is likely to salivate.” — Cynthia Ozick, New York Times Book Review",Paperback,,96 pages,"

","In recent times, the science of ecology has been rejuvenated and has moved to a central position in biology. This volume contains eighteen original, major contributions by leaders in the field, all associates of the late Robert MacArthur, whose work has stimulated many of the recent developments in ecology. The intellectual ferment of the field is reflected in these papers, which offer new models for ecological processes, new applications of theoretical and quantitative techniques, and new methods for analyzing and interpreting a wide variety of empirical data.The first five chapters explore the evolution of species abundance and diversity (R. Levins, E. Leigh, J. MacArthur, R. May, and M. Rosenzweig). The theory of loop analysis is newly applied to understanding stability of species communities under both mendelian and group selection. Species abundance relations, population fluctuations, and continental patterns of species diversity are illustrated and interpreted theoretically. The next section examines the competitive strategies of optimal resource allocation variously employed in plant life histories (W. Schaffer and M. Gadgil), bird diets and foraging techniques (H. Hespenheide), butterfly seasonal flights (A. Shapiro), and forest succession examined by the theory of Markov processes (H. Horn).The seven chapters of the third section study the structure of species communities, by comparing different natural communities in similar habitats (M. Cody, J. Karr and F. James, E. Pianka, J. Brown, J. Diamond), or by manipulating field situations experimentally (R. Patrick, J. Connell). The analyses are of communities of species as diverse as freshwater stream organisms, desert lizards and rodents, birds, invertebrates, and plants. These studies yield insights into the assembly of continental and insular communities, convergent evolution of morphology and of ecological structure, and the relative roles of predation, competition, and harsh physical conditions in limiting species ranges.Finally, the two remaining chapters illustrate how ecological advances depend on interaction of theory with field and laboratory observations (G. E. Hutchinson), and how ecological studies such as those of this volume may find practical application to conservation problems posed by man's accelerating modification of the natural world (E. Wilson and E. Willis).",Paperback,,560 pages,"

","La question essentielle, pour la compréhension de l'état du monde contemporain, est celle de l'inégale répartition des richesses entre les sociétés : pourquoi une telle domination de l'Eurasie dans l'histoire ? Pourquoi ne sont-ce pas les indigènes d'Amérique, les Africains et les aborigènes australiens qui ont décimé, asservi et exterminé les Européens et les Asiatiques ?Cette question cruciale, les historiens ont renoncé depuis longtemps à y répondre, s'en tenant aux seules causes prochaines des guerres de conquête et de l'expansion du monde industrialisé. Mais les causes lointaines, un certain usage de la biologie prétend aujourd'hui les expliquer par l'inégalité supposée du capital génétique au sein de l'humanité.Or l'inégalité entre les sociétés est liée aux différences de milieux, pas aux différences génétiques. Jared Diamond le démontre dans cette fresque éblouissante de l'histoire de l'humanité depuis 13 000 ans. Mobilisant des disciplines aussi diverses que la génétique, la biologie moléculaire, l'écologie des comportements, l'épidémiologie, la linguistique, l'archéologie et l'histoire des technologies, il marque notamment le rôle de la production alimentaire, l'évolution des germes caractéristiques des populations humaines denses, favorisées par la révolution agricole, le rôle de la géographie dans la diffusion contrastée de l'écriture et de la technologie, selon la latitude en Eurasie, mais la longitude aux Amériques et en Afrique.",Paperback,,492 pages,"

His initial audacious and ingenious attack provides clear hints of his future greatness. In just two months, Napoleon's ragtag forces pushed half the respected Piedmontese army out of the war, drove the Austrians partway across Italy, and laid siege to a fortress that assured control of the northern section of the country. In the next 10 months, he and his newly reinvigorated forces marched to one victory after another until their Austrian enemy was pushed back to Vienna.

","A groundbreaking work, this is the first book to cover the arts of the entire continent of Africa, including Egypt, and to survey the art history, rather than the cultural traditions, of African peoples. The authors' unique synthesis of up-to-date research on African arts of many periods and geographic areas has resulted in a major contribution to the literature of art history. Thousands of years of African art, from prehistory to the present, are considered, encompassing sculpture, painting, architecture, textiles, ceramics, and the myriad art forms of personal adornment and performance. Individual authors contribute chapters on their areas of expertise, yet the whole volume works as a seamless text, weaving together everything from prehistoric Saharan rock art to contemporary sculpture, including the rich, multi-faceted art of the African diaspora. Brilliantly illustrated throughout, and including full indexes and bibliography, this volume is a milestone in the study and future perception of African art.

","After years of frustration at the stifling atmosphere of political correctness surrounding discussions of Africa, long time World Bank official Robert Calderisi speaks out. He boldly reveals how most of Africa's misfortunes are self-imposed, and why the world must now deal differently with the continent. Here we learn that Africa has steadily lost markets by its own mismanagement, that even capitalist countries are anti-business, that African family values and fatalism are more destructive than tribalism, and that African leaders prey intentionally on Western guilt. Calderisi exposes the shortcomings of foreign aid and debt relief, and proposes his own radical solutions. Drawing on thirty years of first hand experience, ""The Trouble with Africa ""highlights issues which have been ignored by Africa's leaders but have worried ordinary Africans, diplomats, academics, business leaders, aid workers, volunteers, and missionaries for a long time. It ripples with stories which only someone who has talked directly to African farmers--and heads of state--could recount. Calderisi's aim is to move beyond the hand-wringing and finger-pointing which dominates most discussions of Africa. Instead, he suggests concrete steps which Africans and the world can take to liberate talent and enterprise on the continent. ",Hardcover,,224 pages,"

The Shackled Continent, Robert Guest's fascinating first book, seeks to diagnose the sickness that continues to hobble Africa's development. Using reportage, first hand experience and economic insight, Robert Guest takes us to the roots of the problems. Two fifths of African nations are at war, AIDS has lowered life expectancy to as young as forty years old and investment is almost impossible as houses that could be used as collateral do not formally belong to their owners. Most shocking of all is the evidence that the billions of dollars of aid, given to Africa has had little perceptible effect on the poor The Shackled Continent offers, sometimes controversially, explanations for this state of affairs.

Blending eyewitness reportage with rich historical insight, French searches deeply into the causes of today’s events, illuminating the debilitating legacy of colonization and the abiding hypocrisy and inhumanity of both Western and African political leaders. While he captures the tragedies that have repeatedly befallen Africa’s peoples, French also opens our eyes to the immense possibility that lies in Africa’s complexity, diversity, and myriad cultural strengths.

","""Awe-inspiring . . . a masterly synthesis."" --The New York Times Book Review""Deeply penetrating, intensely thought-provoking and thoroughly informed . . . one of the most important general surveys of Africa that has been produced in the last decade."" --The Washington PostIn 1978, paleontologists in East Africa discovered the earliest evidence of our divergence from the apes: three pre-human footprints, striding away from a volcano, were preserved in the petrified surface of a mudpan over three million years ago. Out of Africa, the world's most ancient and stable landmass, Homo sapiens dispersed across the globe.  And yet the continent that gave birth to human history has long been woefully misunderstood and mistreated by the rest of the world.In a book as splendid in its wealth of information as it is breathtaking in scope, British writer and photojournalist John Reader brings to light Africa's geology and evolution, the majestic array of its landforms and environments, the rich diversity of its peoples and their ways of life, the devastating legacies of slavery and colonialism as well as recent political troubles and triumphs. Written in simple, elegant prose and illustrated with Reader's own photographs, Africa: A Biography of the Continent is an unforgettable book that will delight the general reader and expert alike.  ""Breathtaking in its scope and detail."" --San Francisco Chronicle",Paperback,,816 pages,"

","Theories of international relations, assumed to be universally applicable, have failed to explain the creation of states in Africa. There, the interaction of power and space is dramatically different from what occurred in Europe. In his groundbreaking book, Jeffrey Herbst places the African state-building process in a truly comparative perspective, examining the problem of state consolidation from the precolonial period, through the short but intense interlude of European colonialism, to the modern era of independent states. Herbst's bold contention--that the conditions now facing African state-builders existed long before European penetration of the continent--is sure to provoke controversy, for it runs counter to the prevailing assumption that colonialism changed everything.In identifying how the African state-building process differs from the European experience, Herbst addresses the fundamental problem confronting African leaders: how to extend authority over sparsely settled lands. Indeed, efforts to exert control over vast, inhospitable territories of low population density and varied environmental and geographical zones have resulted in devastating wars, millions of refugees, and dysfunctional governments perpetrating destructive policies.Detailing the precise political calculations of distinct African leaders, Herbst isolates the basic dynamics of African state development. In analyzing how these leaders have attempted to consolidate power, he is able to evaluate a variety of policy alternatives for dealing with the fundamental political challenges facing African states today.",Paperback,,296 pages,"

","Why haven't the poorest Africans been able to prosper in the twenty-first century? Celebrated economist George Ayittey thinks the answer is obvious: economic freedom was denied to them, first by foreign colonial powers and now by indigenous leaders with similarly oppressive practices. As war and conflict replaced peace, Africa's infrastructure crumbled. Instead of bemoaning the myriad difficulties facing the continent today, Ayittey boldly proposes a program of development--a way forward--for Africa. Africa Unchained investigates how Africa can modernize, build, and improve its indigenous institutions, and argues forcefully that Africa should build and expand upon traditions of free markets and free trade rather than continuing to use exploitative economic structures. The economic model here is uniquely African and takes little heed from the developed world; this is sure to be a highly controversial plan for moving Africa forward.",Paperback,,512 pages,"

Strapped to horses and donkeys, Francis and others were taken north into lives of slavery under wealthy Muslim farmers.For ten years, Francis lived in a shed near the goats and cattle that were his responsibility. After two failed attempts to flee--each bringing severe beatings and death threats--Francis finally escaped at age seventeen. He persevered through prison and refugee camps for three more years, winning the attention of United Nations officials who granted passage to America.Now a student and an antislavery activist, Francis Bok has made it his life mission to combat world slavery. His is the first voice to speak to an estimated 27 million people held against their will in nearly every nation, including our own. Escape from Slavery is at once a riveting adventure, a story of desperation and triumph, and a window revealing a world that few have survived to tell.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

","After fifteen weeks on the New York Times Bestseller list, God's Politics not only changed the conversation about faith and politics in this country, it began a movement. All across the country, wherever Jim Wallis spoke, people were frustrated by tax cuts and budgets that widened the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by the government's lack of response to natural disasters, wearied of misinformation and the ongoing war in the Middle East, and exasperated by the impractical political rhetoric about sexual abstinence in lieu of policies that would strengthen more broadly family values and community health.Folks began asking what they could do to promote peace, economic justice, racial equality, and the sanctity of life. They wanted to know how they could influence government policies to better reflect their moral values. In response, Wallis and the editors of Sojourners magazine offer Living God's Politics, a reader's guide for putting the lessons of God's Politics into action. Who will change our government's policies to better integrate our values? We're the ones we've been waiting for, and this book offers us the tools and techniques to change the political landscape for the better.",Paperback,,176 pages,"

","For centuries the apostle Paul has been invoked to justify oppression - whether on behalf of slavery, to enforce unquestioned obedience to the state, to silence women, or to legitimate anti-Semitism. To interpret Paul is thus to set foot on a terrible battleground between spiritual forces. But as Neil Elliott argues, the struggle to liberate human beings from the power of Death requires ""liberating Paul"" from his enthrallment to that power. In this book, Elliott shows that what many people experience as the scandal of Paul is the unfortunate consequence of the way Paul has usually been read, or rather misread, in the churches. In the first half of the book, Elliott examines the many texts historically interpreted to support oppression or maintain the status quo. He shows how often Paul's authentic message has been interpreted in the light of later pseudo-Pauline writings. In Part Two, Elliott applies a ""political key"" to the interpretation of Paul. Though subsequent centuries have turned the cross into a symbol of Christian piety, Elliott forcefully reminds us that in Paul's time this was the Roman mode of executing rebellious slaves, a fact that has profound political implications. Under Elliott's examination, a startlingly new image of Paul begins to emerge, liberated from layers of false interpretation, and free to speak a liberating and challenging word to our world today.",Paperback,,308 pages,"

","""May this little volume be the instrument of opening the eyes of the ignorant to this system — of convincing the wicked, cruel, and hardened slave-holder — and of befriending generally the cause of oppressed humanity."" Moses Roper's hopes for his autobiography were realized upon its 1838 publication; today it is considered among the most important and authentic slave narratives. Born a slave in Caswell County, North Carolina, Roper's father was a planter and his mother a black slave. Roper was separated from his mother at the age of six, the first of many transactions in which he was sold or traded to plantation owners throughout the South. His numerous attempts at escape finally met with success in 1833, when the 18-year-old managed to jump ship on a New York-bound packet. In New England, he began his affiliation with the abolitionist movement by signing the constitution of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and he eventually moved to London, where he met several prominent British abolitionists who assisted him in securing an education. Roper remained active in the the antislavery movement, delivering lectures on his slave experiences and impressing listeners with his articulate and moving accounts of the brutality of slave life and his irrepressible longing for freedom. This memoir abounds in the qualities that made Roper a popular speaker, and it offers readers a powerful insider's view of the horrific realities of life in slavery.",Paperback,,64 pages,"

","Do Christianity and modern liberal democracy share a common moral vision, or are they opposed and even hostile to each other? In Christian Faith and Modern Democracy, Robert Kraynak challenges the commonly accepted view that Christianity is inherently compatible with modern democratic society. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Kraynak argues that there is no necessary connection between Christianity and any form of government and that, in many important respects, Christianity is weakened by its close alliance with contemporary versions of democracy and human rights. Christian Faith and Modern Democracy was written, in part, to convince secular intellectuals that modern democracy needs God. But it was also written in response to the new consensus about politics that has emerged among Christian believers. Almost all churches and theologians now think that the form of government most compatible with Christianity is democracy and that the historic opposition of the Christian tradition to democracy and to various forms of liberalism was a mistake. What caused Christians to change their view of political authority and to embrace liberal democracy? Were they wise to change their view? This provocative book attempts to answer these questions by reexamining the relationship between democracy and Christianity through the lens of St. Augustine's distinction between the city of God and the earthly city, applied to the conditions of the modern age. Kraynak argues that St. Augustine's teaching provides the basis for a Christian theory of constitutional government and permits a variety of legitimate forms of government, including constitutional democracy. Yet, unlike contemporary Christian doctrines, it does so without embracing the subversive premises of liberalism that have threatened to turn the Christian faith into little more than a mirror image of the modern world. Sure to spark controversy among secular intellectuals and Christian believers alike, this insightful volume is an outstanding work of political philosophy with a firm foundation in theology.",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","God, Sex, and Politics examines both sides of the church controversy over homosexuality to consider the ways in which people develop, in everyday thought and interaction, their beliefs about God and justice. Dawne Moon explores how members of Protestant congregations determine what is just and what is not, what is right and what is wrong, what is loving and what is sinful.Through this compelling work we learn that the considerable turmoil surrounding homosexuality in churches has less to do with homosexuality than with the fear of weakening the church's spiritual, communal solidarity. We learn too how the church mirrors the secular world—the fear of division and politics leads members to avoid conflict in the congregations Moon examines. And so, the Protestants who are the subject of her study avoid debating the key issue of whether homosexuality is sinful because of its potentially polarizing effects. The religious culture Moon uncovers is ultimately critical of politics and of the intense moral and social discord that members believe it entails.God, Sex, and Politics will be of enormous value to sociologists of religion and anyone interested in religious controversies over sexuality.",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","Top Jesus scholars Marcus J. Borg & John Dominic Crossan reveal a radical & little-known Jesus. As both authors reacted to & responded to questions about Mel Gibson's blockbuster The Passion of the Christ, they discovered that many Christians are unclear on the details of events during the week leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. Using Mark's gospel as a guide, they present a day-by-day account of Jesus' final week of life. They begin their story on Palm Sunday with two triumphal entries into Jerusalem. The 1st entry, that of Roman governor Pontius Pilate leading Roman soldiers into the city, symbolized military strength. The 2nd heralded a new kind of moral hero who was praised by the people as he rode in on a humble donkey. The Jesus introduced herein is this new moral hero, a more dangerous Jesus than the one enshrined in the church's traditional teachings. The Last Week depicts Jesus giving up his life to protest power without justice & to condemn the rich who lack concern for the poor. In this vein, at the end of the week Jesus marches up Calvary, offering himself as a model for others to do the same when confronted by similar issues. Informed, challenged & inspired, we not only meet the historical Jesus, but meet a new Jesus who engages & invites us to follow him.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Ophrah's Gate is a new age, locale adventure set in Israel. The story illuminates the wakes of devastation, which trail religious and cultural fanaticism. Extortion, treachery, even murders are all sanctioned in the mind of a fanatical millionaire determined to rescue the true church from disgrace. The plot revolves around an archaeological expedition in Israel and delves into the illegal trade in and forgery of antiquities. Kirk Longstreet is a crestfallen, middle-aged stockbroker. Disgusted with corporate American corruption and the emptiness suffusing his own life, he abandoned his brokerage and is a volunteer on the Tel Kefar Archaeological Expedition. The expedition team is housed on a remote farming kibbutz in the Galilee. Kirk is assigned to room with a retired Roman Catholic priest, Father Bill Casey, who is given to spontaneous prophetic declarations. Kirk first considers the mystical old priest annoying but is also awed by his inexplicable insights and spiritual acuity. Professor Moshe Benjamin, the director of the expedition is called to Jerusalem to meet with a long time rival, Professor Niles Thompson. Thompson begs Moshe to listen to a theory about one of the temple treasures listed in the copper scroll of Qumran. Moshe agrees and allows Thompson to join the dig where he believes the treasure is located, beneath a stone in the old city's gateway. While excavating in search of the treasure, a clay tablet with inscription naming several Biblical Characters is discovered. Now, or so it seems, Zionists finally have proof of the rightful claim to all of Israel -- and a major Christian denomination, proof of its pedigree.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

But there is no place for Ellen -- fresh, funny, bright with passion -- in a house filled with the dust of routine and the ritual of prayer, the lingering bitterness of her in-laws' loveless marriage. She tries to be the model woman everyone expects her to be -- teaching at the Catholic school, coaxing her traveling-salesman husband through his increasingly irrational moods, caring for his aging parents -- but Ellen's hopes for her family's future collide with life in this bizarre household, and she worries over her wryly observant adolescent daughter and her timid young son. Encouraged by her friend Barb, a woman ostracized for being ""modern"" and ""wild, "" Ellen begins to consider her own desires and dreams as well. Surrounded by the family's obsession with an exacting, angry God and the disquieting ghosts of the past, Ellen searches for a way to satisfy the demands of this rural community and its traditions until, at last, she discovers the family's darkest secret, one that frees her and changes her life forever.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Risky in conception, hip and yet soulful, this is a prose poem of a novel -- intense, lyrical, and highly evocative -- with a mystery at its center, which keeps the reader in suspense until the final page. In a tour de force that could be described as Altmanesque, we are invited into the private lives of the residents of a quiet urban street in England over the course of a single day. In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. The tranquillity of the street is shattered at day's end when a terrible accident occurs. This tragedy and an utterly surprising twist provide the momentum for the book. But it is the author's exquisite rendering of the ordinary, the everyday, that gives this novel its freshness, its sense of beauty, wonder, and hope. Rarely does a writer appear with so much music and poetry -- so much vision -- that he can make the world seem new.",Paperback,,275 pages,"

","As defender of both the righteous and the questionable, Alan Dershowitz has become perhaps the most famous and outspoken attorney in the land. Whether or not they agree with his legal tactics, most people would agree that he possesses a powerful and profound sense of justice. In this meditation on his profession, Dershowitz writes about life, law, and the opportunities that young lawyers have to do good and do well at the same time.We live in an age of growing dissatisfaction with law as a career, which ironically comes at a time of unprecedented wealth for many lawyers. Dershowitz addresses this paradox, as well as the uncomfortable reality of working hard for clients who are often without many redeeming qualities. He writes about the lure of money, fame, and power, as well as about the seduction of success. In the process, he conveys some of the ""tricks of the trade"" that have helped him win cases and become successful at the art and practice of ""lawyering.""",Paperback,,224 pages,"

Sailor, entrepreneur, and adventurer, Equiano is revealed here as never before, thanks to archival research on an unprecedented scale—some of which even indicates that Equiano may have lied about his origins to advance the antibondage struggle with which he became famously identified.

","In locations around the world, sex tourism is a booming business. What's Love Got to Do with It? is an in-depth examination of the motivations of workers, clients, and others connected to the sex tourism business in Sosúa, a town on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Denise Brennan considers why Dominican and Haitian women move to Sosúa to pursue sex work and describes how sex tourists, primarily Europeans, come to Sosúa to buy sex cheaply and live out racialized fantasies. For the sex workers, Brennan explains, the sex trade is more than a means of survival—it is an advancement strategy that hinges on their successful “performance” of love. Many of these women seek to turn a commercialized sexual transaction into a long-term relationship that could lead to marriage, migration, and a way out of poverty. Illuminating the complex world of Sosúa’s sex business in rich detail, Brennan draws on extensive interviews not only with sex workers and clients, but also with others who facilitate and benefit from the sex trade. She weaves these voices into an analysis of Dominican economic and migration histories to consider the opportunities—or lack thereof—available to poor Dominican women. She shows how these women, local actors caught in a web of global economic relations, try to take advantage of the foreign men who are in Sosúa to take advantage of them. Through her detailed study of the lives and working conditions of the women in Sosúa’s sex trade, Brennan raises important questions about women’s power, control, and opportunities in a globalized economy.",Paperback,,296 pages,"

","Now available in paperback, What's Love Got to Do with It? is an insightful debunking of the way charitable giving disguises American neglect of the public welfare. Award-winning Professor of Social Work and Sociology David Wagner points out that while the United States prides itself on being one of the most generous nations, it provides its citizens with the lowest public benefits of any Western society and has rates of poverty and inequality among the highest in the industrialized world. These two facts, Wagner argues, are not unrelated: independent philanthropy actually provides a cover for the harshness of America's free-market capitalism.In a book that Howard Zinn, author of A People's History of the United States, says ""raises sobering questions for all of us who want to live in a just society"", Wagner offers a provocative contribution to our thinking on philanthropy and social welfare.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BLACK MEN AND WOMEN IN AMERICA ARE IN CRISIS. IT'S TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GONE WRONG AND START THE HEALING PROCESS.  The current divorce rates for black couples has quadrupled since 1960 and is now double that of the general population, rates of domestic violence in black marriages are skyrocketing, and nearly half of married black men admit to having been unfaithful. In What's Love Got to Do with It? Donna Franklin, one of the country's leading African-American sociologists, speaks out on these painful, complex issues, providing an incisive and riveting analysis of the gender tensions that are the legacy of slavery and its aftermath.  Franklin breaks new ground in explaining why black men and women have trouble relating to each other and examines their profoundly different starting points, which are influenced by generations of racism and injustice. She shows how black women's strength and self-sufficiency can be used to nurture relationships. Likewise, she teaches black men how to support one another and their relationships with women without excluding women, as has happened with the Million Man March.  The challenge of mending the rift between black men and women is formidable, but can be made easier. Understanding is the first step on the path to healing.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Why is it that successful black men--black men who are ""at the top of their game"" in the arts, entertainment, politics and athletics--are four times as apt to be married to or dating a woman who is not an African American than they were only thirty years ago? And why are twice as many black men involved in interracial relationships as black women? In addition to their celebrity status, which includes widespread popularity and wealth, black men from Charles Barkley to James Earl Jones to Russell Simmons to Bryant Gumbel share something else in common; something that also characterizes the experiences of more than 250,000 less well-known black men in the United States. They happen to be involved in interracial intimate relationships.Less than fifty years ago such relationships were next to impossible, leading to severe social sanctions. The fact that this is no longer the case is concrete evidence of changes in the quality and character of contemporary race relations. Drawing on her own observations, and her examination of the responses of a small, diverse group of black men who date (in some cases exclusively), have sexual relations with, and marry women who are not of African descent, the book provides insight into the continuing ways that race and ethnic status affect the choices people make in their lives. Until this book, though, these types of relationships have received scant serious attention. Craig-Henderson forthrightly addresses the taboo, interspersing analysis with verbatim accounts from black men involved in such relationships.Grounded in serious research, interviews, and analysis of census data, Black Men in Interracial Relationships examines why such relationships appear to be so popular among black male elites. In the process, the author unravels the mystery behind the apparent absence of black women in black men's lives. It will be of interest to specialists in race, gender, family, and sexual issues, and appropriate for courses in these areas. It is also highly readable and thought-provoking for the general public, who will find its observations and findings fascinating.",Hardcover,,195 pages,"

The 15th edition of 
The Chicago Manual of Style
 has been superseded by the 17th edition.
In the 1890s, a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press prepared a single sheet of typographic fundamentals intended as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book—the first edition of the Manual of Style, published in 1906. Now in its fifteenth edition, The Chicago Manual of Style—the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field—is more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before.Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of the Manual, Chicago's renowned editorial staff drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the Manual's first advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments.Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date—from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, the Manual now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by technology, use new methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources.A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific elements and subject matter, with examples of both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now introduced by a descriptive heading.Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, The Chicago Manual of Style, fifteenth edition, offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, whether on a page or computer screen, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have.What's new in the Fifteenth Edition:* Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice* Scope expanded to include journals and electronic publications* Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage)* Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy* Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources* Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms* Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference* New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions* New, expanded Web site with special tools and features for Manual users at www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.",Hardcover,15th Edition,956 pages,"

","This classic set of essays by Nobel Laureate and leading monetary theorist Milton Friedman presents a coherent view of the role of money, focusing on specific topics related to the empirical analysis of monetary phenomena and policy. The early chapters cover factors determining the real quantity of money held in a community and the welfare implications of policies that affect the quantity held. The following chapters formally restate why quantity analysis has become central to the science of economics. Friedman's presidential address to the American Economic Association, included here, provides a general summary of his views on the role of monetary policy, with an emphasis on its limitations and its possibilities. This theoretical framework is used in examining a number of empirical problems: the demand for money, the explanation of price changes in wartime periods, and the role of money in business cycles. These essays summarize some of the most important results of Friedman's extensive research over the course of his lifetime. The chapters on policy that follow survey the positions of earlier economists and deal with the importance of lags and the implications of destabilizing speculation in foreign markets. Taken as a whole, The Optimum Quantity of Money provides a comprehensive view of the body of monetary theory developed in leading centers of monetary analysis. This work is essential reading for economists and graduate students in the field. The volume will be no less important for practicing business and banking personnel as well. The new statement by Michael Bordo, a student of Friedman's and an expert in the field, provides a sense of where the field now stands in the economy and academy.",Paperback,,296 pages,"

","Recipient of the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Milton Friedman has long been recognized as one of our most important economic thinkers and a leader of the Chicago school of monetary economics. A senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution since 1977, he is also the Paul Snowden Russell Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1946 to 1976. He is the author of many books and articles in economics, including A Theory of the Consumption Function; The Optimum Quantity of Money and Other Essays; A Monetary History of the United States (with A. J. Schwartz); Monetary Statistics of the United States; and Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom. Friedman has also written extensively on public policy, always with a primary emphasis on the preservation and extension of individual freedom. His most important books in this field are Capitalism and Freedom (with Rose D. Friedman, University of Chicago Press, 1962); Bright Promises, Dismal Performance (Thomas Horton and Daughters, 1983), which consists mostly of reprints of columns he wrote for Newsweek from 1966 to 1983; Free to Choose (with Rose D. Friedman, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1980); and Tyranny of the Status Quo (with Rose D. Friedman, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984). Friedman was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988 and received the National Medal of Science the same year.",DVD,,2003 pages,"

","Thus Spoke Zarathustra is Nietzsche's most problematic text. There appears to be no thematic connection between its four Parts and numerous sections. To make it even worse, the book contains a number of thematic contradictions. The standard approach has been a method of selective reading, that is, most critics select a few brilliant passages for edification and ignore the rest. This approach has turned Nietzsche's text into a collection of disjointed fragments. Going against this prevalent approach, T.K. Seung presents the first unified reading of the whole book. He reads it as the record of Zarathustra's epic journey to find spiritual values in the secular world. The alleged thematic contradictions of the text are shown to indicate the turns and twists that are dictated by the hero's epic battle against his formidable opponent. His heroic struggle is eventually resolved by the power of a pantheistic nature-religion. Thus Nietzsche's ostensibly atheistic work turns out to be a highly religious text. The author uncovers this epic plot by reading Nietzsche's text as a baffling series of riddles and puzzles. Hence his reading is not only edifying but also breathtaking. In this unprecedented enterprise, the author takes a complex interdisciplinary approach, engaging the five disciplines of philosophy, psychology, religious studies, literary analysis, and cultural history.",Hardcover,,370 pages,"

","Nietzsche se sirve de la figura de Zaratustra, donde es mas bien un recurso literario ya que no representa al personaje historico y sirve como el portavoz y simbolo de sus ideas principales sobre las que se asienta toda su obra y que son exhaustivamente tratadas a lo largo de este libro: la muerte de Dios, el Ubermensch, la voluntad de poder y (definido por primera vez, aunque no desarrollado explicitamente) el eterno retorno de la vida. Se presenta como el profeta supremo, superior en sabiduria y conocimiento al resto de los humanos. Nietzsche lo emplea como contraposicion a la doctrina de la Iglesia catolica, a la que considera heredera de Socrates en cuanto a la manera de entender la vida. Zaratustra fue escogido por el autor como ejemplo de la filosofia presocratica, para explicar su teoria del Ubermensch (superhombre o suprahombre), vitalista y naturalista, y para reivindicar la aceptacion de los aspectos negativos y positivos de la vida. En definitiva, para proponer una actitud de aceptacion de la vida en su plenitud y negacion del mas alla, que en su opinion era la causa de la debilidad humana. Zaratustra es un ermitano que vive recluido en la montana, donde a lo largo de su retiro reflexiona sobre la vida y la naturaleza del hombre. Una vez siente que es el momento adecuado, decide regresar al mundo para comunicarle el fruto de su conocimiento. Esto queda patente al principio del prologo con la frase: Estoy hastiado de mi sabiduria como la abeja que ha recogido demasiada miel, tengo necesidad de manos que se extiendan""",Paperback,,352 pages,"

","On 15 August 778, Charlemagne’s army was returning from a successful expedition against Saracen Spain when its rearguard was ambushed in a remote Pyrenean pass. Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne’s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and Islam, while Roland’s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.",Paperback,,208 pages,"

","A contemporary prose rendering of the great medieval French epic, The Song of Roland is as canonical and significant as the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf. It extols the chivalric ideals in the France of Charlemagne through the exploits of Charlemagne's nephew, the warrior Roland, who fights bravely to his death in a legendary battle. Against the bloody backdrop of the struggle between Christianity and Islam, The Song of Roland remains a vivid portrayal of medieval life, knightly adventure, and feudal politics. The first great literary works of a culture are its epic chronicles, those that create simple hero-figures about whom the imagination of a nation can crystallize, observed V. S. Pritchett. The Song of Roland is animated by the crusading spirit and fortified by national and religious propaganda. This edition features W. S. Merwin's glowing, lyrical translation.",Paperback,,160 pages,"

","French literature, is has been said, began with The Song of Roland. This great narrative poem of the late eleventh century shares with its epic predecessors by Homer and Vergil a heroic vision of war and warriors. The historic battle of Rencesvals in A.D. 778 was a thwarted enterprise ending in a painful loss, the death of Charlemagne's greatest knight, Roland. In the poem, however, this story of betrayal, defeat, and futile death is transfigured into an idealization of chivalry and valor.The vigor and simplicity of the poem--it uses a vocabulary of fewer than two thousand words in its four thousand lines--are recreated by Frederick Goldin's fluent, idiomatic line-by-line translation into verse that retains the rhythm of the original. His introduction is an absorbing description of the historical, cultural, and literary contexts of the poem.",Hardcover,,163 pages,"

","Published to observe the twelfth centenary of the Battle of Roncevaux, the event that inspired the Chanson de Roland, this edition provides the first systematic analysis of the entire poem. Professor Brault's edition also incorporates the considerable scholarly work done in the half century since the Bedier and Jenkins editions appeared.The underlying theme of this new edition is that the poem is a Christian hero. As imagined by the poet Turoldus- writing about 1100, at the time of the First Crusade- Roland, the nephew of Charlemagne, had no faults and accomplished mighty deeds in warring against the Saracens. The introduction compares the known historical facts about the Battle of Roncevaux with the Roland legend, with various versions of the poem, and with the Oxford text. Christian thought and sensibility are shown to permeate the Chanson de Roland, in its character portrayal and narrative development, as well as in its tone and diction - and to provide its thematic unity and metaphorical consistency. Influences of the oral tradition of the chansons de geste are demonstrated, as are evidences of the accompanying gestures used by the jongleurs in interpreting these works.The Commentary organizes discussion of the 4002 verses into 49 units. The method of analysis is eclectic, combining thematic criticism with philology, exegetical interpretation with iconography. The 66 illustrations, primarily from Romanesque works of art, clarify key passages.",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","The Song of Roland is a well-known hallmark of medieval French literature, yet students often read only excerpts and receive general introductions to the poem and its context. The challenges of teaching Roland include its age and subject matter, its form and composition in Old French, and its representation of Christians and Muslims. This volume in the MLA series Approaches to Teaching World Literature aims to help nonspecialist instructors teach Roland more comprehensively and to offer seasoned medievalists ways to invigorate their pedagogical tactics. Part 1, ""Materials,"" surveys available editions, a wide range of secondary studies devoted to the poem, and electronic aids to teaching. Essays in part 2, ""Approaches,"" elaborate on the poem's contexts, avatars, language techniques, and characters and episodes; describe the diverse classroom strategies that experienced instructors have implemented; and review the voluminous critical canon about the poem.The musical quality of the Song of Roland is vital for students to grasp. A compact disc accompanying the volume showcases reconstructions of sung performances of the Song of Roland in Old French. The examples offered here illuminate the rich quality of Roland's archaic language and demonstrate a few efforts to recover its lost music. Paired with performances of Roland are melodies used as models for singing the poem.",Hardcover,,290 pages,"

","The raucous, exuberant, often wildly funny account of a journey through America and Mexico, Jack Kerouac’s On the Road instantly defined a generation on its publication in 1957: it was, in the words of a New York Times reviewer, “the clearest and most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as ‘beat.’” Written in the mode of ecstatic improvisation that Allen Ginsberg described as “spontaneous bop prosody,” Kerouac’s novel remains electrifying in its thirst for experience and its defiant rebuke of American conformity.In his portrayal of the fervent relationship between the writer Sal Paradise and his outrageous, exasperating, and inimitable friend Dean Moriarty, Kerouac created one of the great friendships in American literature; and his rendering of the cities and highways and wildernesses that his characters restlessly explore are a hallucinatory travelogue of a nation he both mourns and celebrates. Now, The Library of America collects On the Road together with four other autobiographical “road books” published during a remarkable four-year period.The Dharma Bums (1958), at once an exploration of Buddhist spirituality and an account of the Bay Area poetry scene, is notable for its thinly veiled portraits of Kerouac’s acquaintances, including Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Kenneth Rexroth. The Subterraneans (1958) recounts a love affair set amid the bars and bohemian haunts of San Francisco. Tristessa (1960) is a melancholy novella describing a relationship with a prostitute in Mexico City. Lonesome Traveler (1960) collects travel essays that evoke journeys in Mexico and Europe, and concludes with an elegiac lament for the lost world of the American hobo. Also included in Road Novels are selections from Kerouac’s journal, which provide a fascinating perspective on his early impressions of material eventually incorporated into On the Road.",Hardcover,,864 pages,"

","What choices--creative, practical, and technical--make a movie what it is? Here a gifted writer and filmmaker takes us behind the camera and provides a full description of the movie-making process.When John Sayles turned from writing fiction to making movies, he did so with little help from Hollywood: Return of the Secaucus Seven, Sayles's first movie as director and writer, was produced with 60,000 of his own money. Many films later, he still works outside the studio system and guides every phase of his productions.Now Sayles has written an illuminating book about the complex choices that lie at the heart of every movie. Using the making of his film Matewan as an example, he offers chapters on screenwriting, directing, editing, sound, and more. Photographs, sketches, and the complete shooting script illustrate this engaging account of how Sayles's curiosity about a coal miners' strike in the town of Matewan, West Virginia, became a screenplay--and then a movie.",Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Thinking in Pictures shows for the first time, in rigorous shot-by-shot analyses, what Griffith really did—and allows us to understand the implications for film narrative in general. Anyone with an interest in early cinema will find the book compelling, but the text will also intrigue readers seeking understanding of film usages on a more general, theoretical level.When Griffith began making films, the shot had been recognized as a basic element of film, the camera had a certain amount of freedom, transitional effects had been explored, audiences displayed an appetite for narrative. It was the synthesis of these elements, as Jesionowski traces it, that was Griffith's great achievement—for which he has always been honored by other filmmakers, by critics, and by audiences who continue to be moved and excited by his films.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

He spent five years as a prisoner of war in Germany, during which time he wrote his grand thesis, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, which was published in 1949. In 1946 he became a member of the editorial board of Annates, the famous journal founded by Marc Bloch and Lucian Febvre, whom he succeeded at the College de France in 1949. He has been a member of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes and since 1962 has been chief administrator of the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme. Professor Braudel holds honorary doctor¬ates from universities all over the world.Jacket painting: Detail from Breughel the Elder's The Fall of Icarus, from the Musees Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels. (Giraudon)""Braudel deserves a Nobel Prize. . . . [This is] the most remarkable picture of human life in the centuries before the human condition was radically changed by the growth of industry that has yet been presented. A book of great originality, a masterpiece.""—J. H. Plumb, The Washington Post""Braudel's books enthrall. ... He is brilliant in demonstrating how most history is written on the backs of most people.""—John Leonard, The New York Times""Even a preliminary glance at The Structures of Everyday Life shows a book that has no obvious compeer either in scope of reference or level of accessibility to the general reader. ... Its broad authority remains deeply impressive.""—Richard Holmes, Harper's""Here is vast erudition, beautifully arranged, presented with grace of style, with humility before life's complexity and warm humanist feeling. Braudel's subject is nothing less than every¬day life all over the world before the industrial revolution.... He succeeds triumphantly in his first purpose: 'if not to see everything, at least to locate everything, and on the requisite world scale.'""—Angus Calder, The Standard""On neither side of the Atlantic does there live a man or woman with so much knowledge of the past as Braudel, or with a greater sense of its aptness to the intellectual occasion in hand....You can't pick up this big fat book without having your attention transfixed by something or other, if only the great gallery of pictures. They are a masterpiece in themselves.""—Peter Laslett, The Guardian""This new book is unarguably a brilliant survey of demog¬raphy, urbanisation, transport, technology, food, clothing, housing, money and business, social classes, state power and international trade in the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries.""—Theodore Zeldin, The Listener-----By examining in detail the material life of preindustrial peoples around the world, Fernand Braudel significantly changed the way historians view their subject.

","Linguists estimate that there are currently nearly 2,000 languages in Africa, a staggering figure that is belied by the relatively few national languages. While African national politics, economics, and law are all conducted primarily in the colonial languages, the cultural life of the majority of citizens is conducted in a bewildering Babel of local and regional dialects, making language itself the center of debates over multiculturalism, gender studies, and social theory. In The Power of Babel, the noted Africanist scholar Ali Mazrui and linguist Alamin Mazrui explore this vast territory of African language. The Power of Babel is one of the first comprehensive studies of the complex linguistic constellations of Africa. It draws on Ali Mazrui's earlier work in its examination of the ""triple heritage"" of African culture, in which indigenous, Islamic, and Western traditions compete for influence. In bringing the idea of the triple heritage to language, the Mazruis unravel issues of power, culture, and modernity as they are embedded in African linguistic life.The first section of the book takes a global perspective, exploring such issues as the Eurocentrism of much linguistic scholarship on Africa; part two takes an African perspective on a variety of issues from the linguistically disadvantaged position of women in Africa to the relation of language policy and democratic development; the third section presents a set of regional studies, centering on the Swahili language's exemplification of the triple heritage.The Power of Babel unites empirical information with theories of nationalism and pluralism—among others—to offer the richest contextual account of African languages to date.",Paperback,,235 pages,"

","Baseball Hacks isn't your typical baseball book--it's a book about how to watch, research, and understand baseball. It's an instruction manual for the free baseball databases. It's a cookbook for baseball research. Every part of this book is designed to teach baseball fans how to do something. In short, it's a how-to book--one that will increase your enjoyment and knowledge of the game.So much of the way baseball is played today hinges upon interpreting statistical data. Players are acquired based on their performance in statistical categories that ownership deems most important. Managers make in-game decisions based not on instincts, but on probability - how a particular batter might fare against left-handed pitching, for instance.The goal of this unique book is to show fans all the baseball-related stuff that they can do for free (or close to free). Just as open source projects have made great software freely available, collaborative projects such as Retrosheet and Baseball DataBank have made great data freely available. You can use these data sources to research your favorite players, win your fantasy league, or appreciate the game of baseball even more than you do now.Baseball Hacks shows how easy it is to get data, process it, and use it to truly understand baseball. The book lists a number of sources for current and historical baseball data, and explains how to load it into a database for analysis. It then introduces several powerful statistical tools for understanding data and forecasting results.For the uninitiated baseball fan, author Joseph Adler walks readers through the core statistical categories for hitters (batting average, on-base percentage, etc.), pitchers (earned run average, strikeout-to-walk ratio, etc.), and fielders (putouts, errors, etc.). He then extrapolates upon these numbers to examine more advanced data groups like career averages, team stats, season-by-season comparisons, and more. Whether you're a mathematician, scientist, or season-ticket holder to your favorite team, Baseball Hacks is sure to have something for you.Advance praise for Baseball Hacks:""Baseball Hacks is the best book ever written for understanding and practicing baseball analytics. A must-read for baseball professionals and enthusiasts alike.""-- Ari Kaplan, database consultant to the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Baltimore Orioles""The game was born in the 19th century, but the passion for its analysis continues to grow into the 21st. In Baseball Hacks, Joe Adler not only demonstrates that the latest data-mining technologies have useful application to the study of baseball statistics, he also teaches the reader how to do the analysis himself, arming the dedicated baseball fan with tools to take his understanding of the game to a higher level.""-- Mark E.

","كتاب ممتع يصل بالأمور إلى جذورها ويربطها بها. والمتعة التي ينضح بها هذا الكتاب تأتي من الطموح اللا محدود الذي ما فتيء يحرك مخيلة الإنسان ويثير هواجسه ويطلق خبايا نفسه شعرا ورسما ونحتا وموسيقى. عنيت هذا الهاجس الملح الذي يربط الإنسان بالله وبالقوى التي أوجدها ليفسر بها كل شيء والتي لم يستطع العلم، بكل ما أوتي من قوة إقناع ونفاد حجة إلا أن يكتشف هذه الظواهر ويحاول تفسيرها واستخدامها بالشكل الأفضل الذي يناسبه. أما سلوكه فكان قلعة عصية عليه فما زالت ""المعتقدات القبلية"" ضاربة جذورها في سلوكنا، كما كان الأمر عليه في أجدادنا. المتعة الكبرى التي تكمن في الكتاب هو أنه مرآة لنا نرى فيه أنفسنا الموغلة في التاريخ ونرى أنفسنا نتشارك مع جدودنا فيما اكتشفوه فنكتشفها على حقيقتها.إنه كتاب لا يتوقف عند حدود العادات والتقاليد وإنما يذهب بنا إلى حكاية الاكتشافات والاختراعات فيحكي لنا كيف تم اكتشاف الآلة وماهي الصدفة التي أوجدتها وكيف تم تطويرها، إلخ",,,410 pages,"

","Huston Smith is revered in the world's spiritual community as an ecumenical sage of the twentieth century. From considerations of individual identity to reflections on humanity's broadest religious and philosophical venturings, he has bravely explored the deep connections among world spiritual traditions for over thirty years. The nineteen essays collected in Huston Smith: Essays on World Religions span the career and chart the intellectual journey of this groundbreaking thinker. Originally published in journals of very small circulation, this work has never been available to general readers before. Smith writes with erudition and a warm personal style on such varied phenomena as the psychedelic experience of soma and the vedic religion, the supernatural as it appears to the Chinese intelligentsia, spiritual discipline in Zen training, the simultaneous octave sung by a single Tibetan monk, and the West's obsession with a dichotomy between God and man. This collection provides an intimate glimpse into the development of an extraordinary mind. The guiding motive of Huston Smith's life and work has been to tenaciously bridge the gap between diverse cultural realities and a single transcendent reality. In this collection's new and engaging foreword, he discusses this approach to a truly global perspective on the spiritual life of humankind. Editor M. Darrol Bryant illuminates the backgrounds of Smith's life and thought in an insightful introduction.",Paperback,,290 pages,"

","Too often we have come to associate faith with narrow interests and competing dogmas. The Big Picture gives voice to a larger point of view: that a grand and remarkable unity underlies all of our major religious traditions. Here is the ""forgotten truth"" about the sacred teachings, principles, and themes that have unified perennial philosophies through the ages, brought to life by our greatest living scholar of comparative religions, Huston Smith. On The Big Picture, Smith draws from his lifetime of scholarship to describe for us the nature of ultimate reality, combining the most up-to-date findings of science with the enduring truths of the world's greatest religions. The vision is mystical and, as supported by the evidence Smith introduces, completely believable. Join this distinguished author, scholar, and teacher as he explores the world's great religions-and what they all have in common. ""America's religious landscape is changing before our eyes, and no one has done more to prepare us for the new religious reality than Huston Smith.""-Bill Moyers",Audio CD,Abridged,0 pages,"

","In The Book of Jewish Values, Rabbi Joseph Telushkin has combed the Bible, the Talmud, and the whole spectrum of Judaism's sacred writings to give us a manual on how to lead a decent, kind, and honest life in a morally complicated world. Telushkin speaks to the major ethical issues of our time, issues that have, of course, been around since the beginning. He offers one or two pages a day of pithy, wise, and easily accessible teachings designed to be put into immediate practice. The range of the book is as broad as life itself: The first trait to seek in a spouse (Day 17)When, if ever, lying is permitted (Days 71-73)Why acting cheerfully is a requirement, not a choice (Day 39)What children don't owe their parents (Day 128)Whether Jews should donate their organs (Day 290)An effective but expensive technique for curbing your anger (Day 156)How to raise truthful children (Day 298)What purchases are always forbidden (Day 3)In addition, Telushkin raises issues with ethical implications that may surprise you, such as the need to tip those whom you don't see (Day 109), the right thing to do when you hear an ambulance siren (Day 1), and why wasting time is a sin (Day 15). Whether he is telling us what Jewish tradition has to say about insider trading or about the relationship between employers and employees, he provides fresh inspiration and clear guidance for every day of our lives.",Hardcover,,544 pages,"

","When, if ever, should lying be permitted?If you've damaged a person's reputation unfairly, can the damage be undone?Is a person who sells weapons responsible for how those weapons are used?if the fetus is not a life, what is it? How, as an adult, can one carry out the command to honor one's parents when they make unreasonable demands?What are the nine biblical challenges a good person must meet?What do the great Jewish writings of the last 3,500 years tell us about these and all other vital questions about our lives? Rabbi Joseph Telushkin has devoted his life to the search for answers within the teachings of Judaism. In Jewish Wisdom, Rabbi Telushkin, the author of the highly acclaimed Jewish Literacy, weaves together a tapestry of stories from the Bible and Talmud, and the insights of Jewish commentators and writers from Maimonides, Rashi, and Hillel to Einstein, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Elie Wiesel. A richer source of crucial life lessons would be hard to imagine.Accompanying this extraordinary compilation is Teluslikins compelling commentary, which reveals how these texts continue to instruct and challenge Jewsand all people concerned with leading ethical livestoday As he discusses these texts, Rabbi Telushkin addresses issues of fundamental interest to modern readers: how to live with honesty and integrity in an often dishonest world; how to care for the sick and dying; how to teach children to respect both themselvesand others, how to understand and confront such great tragedies as antisemitism. and the Holocaust; what God wants from humankind. Within Jewish Wisdom's ninety chapters the reader will find extended sections illuminating Jewish perspectives on sex, romance, and marriage, what kind of belief in God a Jew can have after the Holocaust, how to use language ethically, the conflicting views of the Bible and Talmud on the death penalty, and much, much more.Jewish Wisdom adds a new dimension to the many widely read contemporary books that retell the stones and reveal the essence of classic religious and secular literature. Possibly the most far-ranging volume of stories and quotations from Jewish texts, Jewish Wisdom will itself become a classic, a book that not only has the capacity to transform how you view the world, but one that well might change how you choose to live your life.",Hardcover,,688 pages,"

","The ?rst 30 cm of the earth s surface represents a fragile and valuable ecos- tem, thanks to which terrestrial plants, and indirectly animals and humans, can live. The microbial activity occurring in soil is largely responsible for its physical and nutritional quality. Among the micro-organisms living in soil, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a major role. They are present in all types of soil, everywhere on the planet, living in symbiotic association with the roots of most plant species. They have co-evolved with plants for 400 million years, improving their nutrition and resistance to v- ious types of stress. Present practices in conventional agriculture, which introduce great amounts of chemicals, have eliminated or underexploited the AM symbiosis. The rational exploitation of AM fungi in sustainable agriculture, to help minimize the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, has been hampered by several biological characteristics of these mic- organisms: they cannot be grown in the absence of a plant host and their genetic structure is very complex. Despite these limitations, biologists have made important progress in understanding better the functioning of AM fungi. An in vitro technique has been developed using mycorrhizal root organ cultures, which made it possible to investigate the genetics, cell biology and physiology of AM fungi. We can now be objective enough to critically evaluate the impacts the in vitro technique has had to improve our knowledge on mycorrhizal symbiosis.""",Hardcover,,392 pages,"

From Chapter TRIUMPHS OF THE GODS, Io and Europa
Suddenly the girls looked up and saw a herd of bulls coming toward them. ""Oh, look!"" cried Europa to her friends. ""Have you ever seen a bull as magnificent as thaThe bull, who was Zeus of course, ambled toward Europa and mooed softly. ""How gentle he is!"" Europa said, stroking him. Then the bull lay down at her feet, as if inviting her to climb onto his back. Europa did so without fear. But before her friends could join her, the bull leaped up, dashed toward the ocean, and then flew over it, far out to sea. Clinging to the bull's horns, Europa looked down and saw a procession of sea gods riding on dolphins, led by Poseidon. Europa cried out to the bull, ""You, too, must be a god. And if you are, take pity on me. Do not carry me off to some strange land far from all my friends."" And the bull answered, ""I am Zeus, lord of the sky, but do not be afraid, for I love you. I am carrying you to my own special island, Crete, where I was born. There I shall show myself to you as a god, and you shall bear me sons who one day will be famous and revered."" And so it happened. Europa became the mother of a great king, Minos, and also of Rhadamanthus, both judges of the dead. And Europa, after whom the continent of Europe is named, became even more famous than her sons.

","A million copy seller, Henry Hazlitt’s Economics in One Lesson is a classic economic primer. But it is also much more, having become a fundamental influence on modern “libertarian” economics of the type espoused by Ron Paul and others.Considered among the leading economic thinkers of the “Austrian School,” which includes Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich (F.A.) Hayek, and others, Henry Hazlitt (1894-1993), was a libertarian philosopher, an economist, and a journalist. He was the founding vice-president of the Foundation for Economic Education and an early editor of The Freeman magazine, an influential libertarian publication.  Hazlitt wrote Economics in One Lesson, his seminal work, in 1946. Concise and instructive, it is also deceptively prescient and far-reaching in its efforts to dissemble economic fallacies that are so prevalent they have almost become a new orthodoxy.Many current economic commentators across the political spectrum have credited Hazlitt with foreseeing the collapse of the global economy which occurred more than 50 years after the initial publication of Economics in One Lesson. Hazlitt’s focus on non-governmental solutions, strong — and strongly reasoned — anti-deficit position, and general emphasis on free markets, economic liberty of individuals, and the dangers of government intervention make Economics in One Lesson, every bit as relevant and valuable today as it has been since publication.",Paperback,,218 pages,"

","Hawai'i's Story by Hawai'i's Queen is an account of those difficult years at the end of the nineteenth century, when native Hawaiian historian David Malo's 1837 prophecy concerning ""the small ones"" being ""gobbled up"" came true for the Hawaiian Islands. When this book was first published in 1898, it was an international plea for justice. Just as Admiral Thomas had restored Hawaiian sovereignty in 1843 following an illegal action by Lord Paulet, Queen Lili'uokalani prayed that the American nation would similarly reestablish the Hawaiian throne. Queen Lili'uokalani died on November 11, 1917, her poignant plea for justice unanswered. ""If a big wave comes in large fishes will come from the dark ocean which you never saw before, and when they see the small fishes they will eat them up; such also is the case with large animals, they will prey on the smaller ones; the ships of the whitemen have come, and smart people have arrived from the Great Countries which you have never seen before, they know our people are few in number and living in a small country; they will eat us up, such has always been the case with large countries, the small ones have been gobbled up."" - David Malo",Paperback,,424 pages,"

","A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories. . . until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments, and fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters.Did You Know?--- The Notebook was only the third novel in recent history to spend over a year as a hardcover best-seller?One of the poems by Walt Whitman quoted in the novel is entitled ""To a Common Prostitute?""The title for the novel was chosen by Theresa Park, Nicholas's agent?",Mass Market Paperback,,213 pages,"

","The Smithsonian holds more than 13 million images spanning over 150 years of taking and collecting photographs. This largely unknown body of photography (most never before published) represents nothing less than the Smithsonian's effort, in the name of all Americans, to describe and comprehend the world. Open anywhere in these pages to be plunged into the history of our modernity, and see what the Smithsonian deemed important to document and preserve. The famous, the infamous, and the never-before-seen are here in a remarkable “democracy of images”: Amelia Earhart, Abraham Lincoln, P.T. Barnum and Tom Thumb, John Brown, Frederick Douglass, Lucille Ball, Greta Garbo, Babe Ruth; the earliest views of the moon and the earliest panoramic view of Damascus; rare Native American photography; views of Asia, Africa, and the American West; photographs of early flight, and much, much more.

","A sequential sight-singing curriculum for all choirs. Each of the six units (containing four lessons each) clearly introduces new music reading concepts, reinforces those concepts with several rhythm and pitch exercises, motivates students with helpful hints and challenge exercises, and concludes with fun-filled review games and ""Evaluating Your Performance"" questions. The helpful ""Getting Ready"" pages (which precede each unit) are filled with music fundamentals, and for choirs who have never read music before, an optional ""Before We Begin"" chapter opens the book. And it's all neatly laid out in a 96-page octavo sized publication; a perfect fit for your students, and their folders. From whole notes to sixteenth-note patterns, seconds to sevenths, key signatures, dynamics, articulations, and tempo markings; it's all here, and it's all logically ordered to insure student success! Spend just a few minutes a day with this book and your choir, too, will learn to ""Sing at First Sight!"" This title is available in SmartMusic.",Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Do you believe in love at first sight? If you're like some, you've only heard about love at first sight, perhaps dismissed it as cliche or mere emotional overload. But if you're among the lucky ones, you've experienced it -- within one hour of meeting someone, you felt strange and powerful feelings of love for him or her. Love at First Sight is the first book to deeply examine this remarkable human phenomenon. Author Earl Naumann conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 1,500 individuals across America, of all ages, races, religions and backgrounds. His findings revealed a staggering statistic -- nearly half of his respondents had experienced love at first sight, but for different reasons and in dramatically different ways. Written in a personal, yet highly professional style, Love at First Sight also includes heartfelt love stories from survey respondents that reveal the soul behind the phenomenon -- an almost magical experience that leaves a lasting impression. Amazing Statistics to Make a Believer out of You: --Nearly two-thirds of the population believes in love at first sight--Of the believers, more than half have experienced it--55 percent of those who experienced love at first sight married the object of their affection--Three-quarters of those who married as a result of love at first sight have stayed married -- well over the national average!",Paperback,,336 pages,"

But Golde's scheme goes awry when she meets the imposing lord, and is assailed by unexpected passion. It seems that her deception will cost more than she dreamed, for Golde is losing her heart to a tempestuous man who possesses even more secrets than she.",Mass Market Paperback,,336 pages,"

","In this extraordinary book, Alexander Masters has created a moving portrait of a troubled man, an unlikely friendship, and a desperate world few ever see. A gripping who-done-it journey back in time, it begins with Masters meeting a drunken Stuart lying on a sidewalk in Cambridge, England, and leads through layers of hell…back through crimes and misdemeanors, prison and homelessness, suicide attempts, violence, drugs, juvenile halls and special schools–to expose the smiling, gregarious thirteen-year-old boy who was Stuart before his long, sprawling, dangerous fall. Shocking, inspiring, and hilarious by turns, Stuart: A Life Backwards is a writer’s quest to give voice to a man who, beneath his forbidding exterior, has a message for us all: that every life–even the most chaotic and disreputable–is a story worthy of being told.From the Hardcover edition.",Hardcover,,300 pages,"

With humour, compassion (and exasperation) Alexander Masters slowly works back through post-office heists, prison riots and the exact day Stuart discovered violence, to unfold the reasons why he changed from a happy-go-lucky little boy into a polydrug-addicted-alcoholic Jekyll and Hyde personality, with a fondness for what he called 'little strips of silver' (knives, to you and me).",Paperback,,292 pages,"

","Taking up where Many Mansions left off, the book pursues the philosophical aspects of reincarnation evidenced in the life readings of world-renowned psychic, Edgar Cayce, as well as from data derived from experiments to determine whether human memory can be taken back to a period before birth. She touches on some of the people who believed in reincarnation—among them, Plato, Virgil, Emerson, Whitman and Edison. The implications of reincarnation for art, psychology, and religion are considered. She notes, in conclusion, the hope and promise that reincarnation holds for our troubled world. This is an important, heartening book, as interesting and credible as it is inspiring. Lucid, concrete, consistent, it will help individuals understand themselves and their destiny.

","Today Lebanon is one of the world's most divided countries. But paradoxically the faction-ridden Lebanese, both Christians and Muslims, have never shown a keener consciousness of common identity. How can this be? In the light of modern scholarship, a famous Lebanese writer and scholar examines the historical myths on which his country's warring communities have based their conflicting visions of the Lebanese nation. He shows that Lebanon cannot afford this divisiveness, that in order to develop and maintain a sense of political unity, it is necesary to distinuish fact from fiction and then build on what is real in the common experience of both groups.Salibi offers a major reinterpretation of Lebanese history and provides remarkable insights into the dynamic of Lebanon's recent conflict. In so doing, he illuminates important facets of his country's present and future. This book also gives a masterly account of how the imagined communities that underlie modern nationalism are created and will be of interest to students of international affairs as well as Near Eastern scholars.",Paperback,,254 pages,"

","Catherine Cornille has gathered ten superb essays that explore the growing phenomenon of individuals identifying themselves as followers of more than one religious tradition. The essays are scholarly in tone but superbly edited to make them an essential, readable part of every serious course on interreligious interchange. Cornille, Jan Van Bragt, Francis Clooney, and Elisabeth Harris discuss the phenomenon in general and in relation to Japan, India, and Sri Lanka. John B. Cobb, Jr., Jacques Dupuis, Werner Jeanrond, and Claude Geffre offer critical and positive reflections on the phenomenon, while Joseph O'Leary and Raimon Panikkar offer Buddhist and philosophical reflections on the limitations of Western either/or approaches to religious identity. Each author writes from a lifetime of study and experience. Their reflections will illuminate this important reality that has crept up on the world over the last twenty years. The result will prove that the late Joseph Kitagawa was prescient when he cautioned that the world is ""Easternizing"" as much as it is ""Westernizing, "" and that ""modernizing"" is perhaps a far from adequate key to naming the dominant pattern in world history in our age.",Paperback,,152 pages,"

Do I Wake or Sleep was praised by Edmund Wilson in The New Yorker (She has cut to roundness and smoothed to convexity a little crystal of literary form that concentrates the light like a burning glass ... ) and by Diana Trilling, who also wrote of Bolton with the publication of her next novel, The Christmas Tree, ... she is the best woman writer of fiction in this country today. Despite such praise, Bolton had all but disappeared from the literary landscape by the time of her death in 1975. With the reissue of these novels her work is once again getting the attention of serious critics (Vivian Gornick in the Los Angeles Times, Gore Vidal in The New York Review of Books, and Margo Jefferson in the New York Times). All three novels are set in New York City, the place itself becoming a character in Bolton's hands. The timeless insight of her work can be savored again ...

","In the years since Stonewall, the world has witnessed an outpouring of research, critical inquiry, and re-interpretation of gay life and culture. This book draws on groundbreaking new material to present a comprehensive survey of all things gay, stretching back to ancient Sumeria and ranging to the present day. Critically acclaimed historian Robert Aldrich and ten leading scholars juxtapose thought-provoking essays with an extensive selection of images, many never before seen. This masterful combination reveals the story behind gay culture from the industrialized world to the remotest corners of tribal New Guinea. Among the contributors are noted names in GLBT studies such as Brett Beemyn (author of Bisexuality in the Lives of Men), Charles Hupperts (expert on classical antiquity at the University of Amsterdam), Helmut Puff (University of Michigan expert on the medieval world), and Florence Temagne (author of A History of Homosexuality in Europe). The book covers such topics as the Old Testament relationship between Jonathan and David, the Age of Confucius, Native American berdaches, Polynesian mahus, Berlin in the '20s, Stonewall and the disco-flavored hedonism that followed, and the advent of AIDS, Act Up, and Angels in America. This book is an important contribution to understanding what makes gay life and culture universal throughout human culture and across time.",Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","""It seems as though there are many in the body of Christ today that have placed the church, the gathering of believers, last on their list. No longer is it a priority. It takes a back seat to other things they have going on in their lives."" Such powerful comments adorn the pages of Robert Gay's new work, Planted. Gay aptly demonstrates that while the Lord desires for every believer to be planted, the concept of commitment to the local body demonstrated by many who regard themselves as Christian is alien to God's will for their lives. Until we become committed afresh, we risk missing the harvest of fruit borne by the blessing of being secured in good ground. Planted is a book that intrigues the reader from the first word to the last. Robert Gay places biblical wisdom about God's desires for His people into a context that touches the heart regardless of where you stand with Him. Planted inspires and uplifts. It gives confirmation that God continues to nurture and tend those planted in His garden. Planted teaches that fruit comes only as a product of being planted in fertile soil, that God is glorified when we bear fruit, and that our fruitfulness swells the heart of the Father. Planted is a book that every pastor will appreciate and will want each of his members to read. About the author: Robert Gay trains Christians internationally iin spiritual warfare through praise. He has written numerous songs recorded by Integrity's Hosanna! Music and serves as worship leader at Eagle's Nest Christian Fellowship, San Antonio, Texas.",Paperback,,224 pages,"

","At turns autobiographical, political, literary, erotic, and humorous, Black Gay Man will spoil our preconceived notions of not only what it means to be black, gay and male but also what it means to be a contemporary intellectual. Both a celebration of black gay male identity as well as a powerful critique of the structures that allow for the production of that identity, Black Gay Man introduces the eloquent new voice of Robert Reid-Pharr in cultural criticism. At once erudite and readable, the range of topics and positions taken up in Black Gay Man reflect the complexity of American life itself. Treating subjects as diverse as the Million Man March, interracial sex, anti-Semitism, turn of the century American intellectualism as well as literary and cultural figures ranging from Essex Hemphill and Audre Lorde to W.E.B. DuBois, Frantz Fanon and James Baldwin, Black Gay Man is a bold and nuanced attempt to question prevailing ideas about community, desire, politics and culture. Moving beyond critique, Reid-Pharr also pronounces upon the promises of a new America. With the publication of Black Gay Man, Robert Reid-Pharr is sure to take his place as one of this country's most exciting and challenging left intellectuals.",Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","Millions of children in the United States have gay or lesbian parents, and the number of same-sex parents is increasing at an ever-expanding rate. But although many attitudes are changing, gay and lesbian parents and their children need protection and support as the heated cultural battle over same-sex unions continues to escalate. Families of Value offers a poignant defense of families with same-sex parents, and it does so primarily through the powerful use of real-life examples. Robert Bernstein, author of the acclaimed Straight Parents, Gay Children, presents intimate portraits of pioneer families with gay and lesbian parents who are leading the charge in the struggle to bring about social change. Their unique stories, in turn hard-hitting and affecting, portray the resistance these brave parents have faced, their views of the current cultural climate and, most importantly, the intense passion and dedication that they have devoted to raising sound, healthy, and well-adjusted children.",Paperback,,288 pages,"

","The best-selling bariatric cookbook, with more than 125 low-carb, low-fat, high-protein recipes for patients to enjoy after weight-loss surgery.In April 2003 Patt Levine underwent ""Lap-Band"" gastric surgery, one of the primary bariatric surgeries being widely practiced today. As a lifelong foodie, she was expecting the worst when her surgeon's nutritionist handed her dietary guidelines to follow post-surgery, and she was right. With her decades of cooking skills, she immediately set out to devise low-fat dishes that would be just as delicious pureed and chopped as they would be served whole. As an added problem, she wanted to cook for her husband at the same time. This first-ever cookbook for the hundreds of thousands who are lining up for bariatric bypass surgery is proof that it can be done. With collaborator Michele Bontempo-Saray, the author has created 125 recipes that contain no added sugar, are very low in fat, and get their carbohydrates almost exclusively from fruits and vegetables. Each recipe includes specific guidelines for preparation of the dish for every stage of the eating programs for Lap-Band, gastric bypass, and Biliopancreatric Diversion Duodenal Switch (BPD-DS) patients, as well as suggestions for sharing meals with those who have not gone through gastric surgery. Creative recipes cover every meal and food-breakfast and brunch, soups, vegetables, main courses, and sweet indulgences.",Paperback,,208 pages,"

","The Same Embrace tells the powerful story of two young men struggling against a heritage of intolerance and silence. Twins Jacob and Jonathan were inseparable while growing up in their second-generation-American Jewish family. As adults, though, they are almost hopelessly estranged--Jacob is a gay activist in Boston, while Jonathan lives the strict, disciplined life of an Orthodox student at a yeshiva in Jerusalem. In the shadow of a tragedy, Jacob travels to Israel in the hopes of finding common ground with his brother. But his twin's new assurance and faith force Jacob to reexamine his own sexual and religious identities, as well as his place in his complex and haunted family history. An ultimate confrontation between the brothers lays bare the shattering secrets of a legacy that began during the Holocaust.Alternating between the present and Jacob's childhood memories, The Same Embrace moves gracefully from anger and alienation toward forgiveness and acceptance. A striking debut, this novel depicts a quintessentially American search for belonging.",Paperback,,304 pages,"

His visions of alienation and terror have not lost their power to shake our complacency even in this present age, hardened as it is to violence and social decay. In this stimulating collection of essays, a distinguished group of specialists in comparative literature and the social sciences explores the themes and problems with which Dostoevski struggled as both a writer and as a man and assesses their continuing relevance to the modern world. Encompassing a wide range of topics and perspectives, this collection enriches our knowledge and appreciation of a writer whose prophetic visions of alienation and explorations of the dark side of the human psyche continue to fascinate readers and students of the human condition.",Hardcover,,244 pages,"

","This collection, unique to the Modern Library, gathers seven of Dostoevsky's key works and shows him to be equally adept at the short story as with the novel. Exploring many of the same themes as in his longer works, these small masterpieces move from the tender and romantic White Nights, an archetypal nineteenth-century morality tale of pathos and loss, to the famous Notes from the Underground, a story of guilt, ineffectiveness, and uncompromising cynicism, and the first major work of existential literature. Among Dostoevsky's prototypical characters is Yemelyan in The Honest Thief, whose tragedy turns on an inability to resist crime. Presented in chronological order, in David Magarshack's celebrated translation, this is the definitive edition of Dostoevsky's best stories.",,,322 pages,"

","The American university has embraced a thorough secularism that makes it increasingly marginal in a society that is characterized by high levels of religious belief. The very secularization that was supposed to be a liberating influence has resulted in the university's failure to provide leadership in political, cultural, social, and even scientific arenas.In The Decline of the Secular University, C. John Sommerville explores several different ways in which the secular university fails in its mission through its trivialization of religion. He notes how little attention is being given to defining the human, so crucial in all aspects of professional education. He alerts us to problems associated with the prevailing secular distinction between ""facts"" and ""values."" He reviews how the elimination of religion hampers the university from understanding our post-Cold War world. Sommerville then shows how a greater awareness of the intellectual resources of religion might stimulate more forthright attention to important matters like our loss of a sense of history, how to problematize secularism, the issue of judging religions, the oddity of academic moralizing, and the strangeness of science at the frontiers.Finally, he invites the reader to imagine a university where religion is not ruled out but rather welcomed as a legitimate voice among others. Sommerville's bracing and provocative arguments are sure to provoke controversy and stimulate discussion both inside and outside the academy.",Hardcover,,147 pages,"

","Just two years after completing Crime and Punishment, which explored the mind of a murderer, Dostoevsky produced another masterpiece, The Idiot. This time the author portrays a truly beautiful soul—a character he found difficult to bring to life because, as he wrote, ""beauty is the ideal, and neither my country, nor civilized Europe, know what that ideal of beauty is.” The result was one of Dostoevsky’s greatest characters—Prince Myshkin, a saintly, Christ-like, yet deeply human figure.The story begins when Myshkin arrives on Russian soil after a stay in a Swiss sanatorium. Scorned by St. Petersburg society as an idiot for his generosity and innocence, the prince finds himself at the center of a struggle between a rich, kept woman and a beautiful, virtuous girl, who both hope to win his affection. Unfortunately, Myshkin’s very goodness seems to bring disaster to everyone he meets. The shocking denouement tragically reveals how, in a world obsessed with money, power, and sexual conquest, a sanatorium is the only place for a saint. ",Hardcover,,652 pages,"

","Challenging notions of race and sexuality presumed to have originated and flourished in the slave South, Diane Miller Sommerville traces the evolution of white southerners' fears of black rape by examining actual cases of black-on-white rape throughout the nineteenth century. Sommerville demonstrates that despite draconian statutes, accused black rapists frequently avoided execution or castration, largely due to intervention by members of the white community. This leniency belies claims that antebellum white southerners were overcome with anxiety about black rape. In fact, Sommerville argues, there was great fluidity across racial and sexual lines as well as a greater tolerance among whites for intimacy between black males and white females. According to Sommerville, pervasive misogyny fused with class prejudices to shape white responses to accusations of black rape even during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods, a testament to the staying power of ideas about poor women's innate depravity.Based predominantly on court records and supporting legal documentation, Sommerville's examination forces a reassessment of long-held assumptions about the South and race relations as she remaps the social and racial terrain on which southerners--black and white, rich and poor--related to one another over the long nineteenth century.",Paperback,,432 pages,"

","The Insulted and Injured is that tale of a love quadrangle -- an improbably unpossessive and uninvidious love quadrangle, at that -- told by a young novelist not to unlike Dostoevsky himself. (A young author who has just published a novel so much like Dostoevsky's Poor Folk, in fact, that we find ourselves tempted to wonder over the author's private life. But we'll refrain.) Vanya (the narrator and fictional author) has a crush on Natasha, who has left her family to live with her new lover, Alyosha. Alyosha is a sweetheart, but he's also a little dim; he's the son of Prince Valkovsky, a Machiavellian character who's the villain of the tale. Prince Valkovsky hopes to gain wealth and stature by marrying Alyosha off to an heiress -- Katya. The Prince's machinations make him one of the most memorable ""predatory types"" in the Dostoevsky ouvre.",Hardcover,,333 pages,"

","Esta novela, una de las mas grandes e imperecederas de la literatura universal, contiene dos de los temas caracteristicas de Dostoyevski: la relacion entre la culpa y el castigo y la idea de la fuerza redentora del sufrimiento humano, planteando con todo vigor el conflicto entre el Bien y el Mal, ese dualismo etico que es una constante en la obra del autor. Bajo el armazon naturalista de una novela de tesis, subyace una alegoria metafisica y moral. Observa Dostoyevski que el castigo no intimida al criminal, pues este de por si pide ya moralmente un castigo. Entre la obra ingente del novelista ruso, es este libro, sin duda, el de mayor plenitud formal.",Paperback,,544 pages,"

","Dostoevsky’s most revolutionary novel, Notes from Underground marks the dividing line between nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In full retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man’s essentially irrational nature.Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.",Paperback,,150 pages,"

","More than ten years after the breakup of the Soviet Union, none of the major powers, including Russia, has developed a cohesive geopolitical strategy for dealing with the countries and regions that once made up the USSR. Even after September 11 and the sudden importance of Central Asia in the struggle against global terrorism, the United States continues to deal with the region in fragmented and incomplete ways. Thinking Strategically, the first volume in a series focusing on security challenges posed by the former Soviet Union, addresses the economic, political, and security interests at stake in Kazakhstan for Russia, the US, China, Europe, and Japan.Kazakhstan presents an interesting case study both because of its role as a pivot point between Russia and the world beyond and because of its position in Central Asia. The contributors to this book call it variously a buffer, a meeting place, a bridge, a gateway, and a strategic arena. Because of its internal problems--which include great economic uncertainty despite vast oil wealth, a disintegrating infrastructure, and the potential for internal instability--and its geopolitical position, Kazakhstan and the region of Central Asia present a complex set of opportunities and dangers for the major powers.The authors of each chapter, who come from Russia, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Kazakhstan, address the security challenges posed by Kazakhstan and Central Asia from the point of view of their respective countries or regions. From the Russian perspective, for example, Kazakhstan itself is central--as a bulwark against instability and a close economic partner--and Central Asia subordinate; other countries tend to view the entire Central Asia region strategically.",Paperback,,255 pages,"

","Instructor Resources: PowerPoint slides of the book’s exhibits.Spending millions of dollars to renovate, reconfigure, expand, or replace a facility can be intimidating without the right direction. Healthcare Facility Planning: Thinking Strategically, Second Edition, is a practical guide that will help healthcare executives move confidently from planning to implementation by deploying an integrated facility planning process, understanding the trends that affect space utilization and configuration, and planning flexible facilities.The book’s focus is on predesign planning—a stage of the healthcare facility planning, design, and construction process that is frequently overlooked as organizations eagerly jump from strategic planning into the more glamorous phase of design. Healthcare executives have the greatest opportunity to express a vision for their organization’s future during predesign planning, and decisions made during this stage have the greatest impact on long-term operational costs and future flexibility. Careful predesign planning allows an organization to rethink its current patient care delivery model, operational systems and processes, and use of technology to ensure a facility substantially benefits patients, caregivers, and payers.This new edition addresses current issues—new financial incentives, fluctuating utilization and demand, constant pressure for technology adoption and deployment, rising turf wars among specialists, intense focus on patient safety, and aging physical plants—that affect the way facilities are used, planned, financed, and built. Detailed examples, guidelines, and case studies, many new to this edition, lead the reader step-by-step through the facility planning process. This book’s planning process reveals how a new facility can improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and create new revenue streams, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing and well engineered.Highlights include:Deploying an integrated facility planning process tailored to an institution’s unique needs Understanding the trends that affect space allocation and configuration Defining strategic direction and future demand Coordinating operations improvement initiatives and planned technology investments with facility planning",Paperback,,216 pages,"

","An emergent approach to organizational strategy making assumptions that few organizations actually realize the goal of deliberative, top-down strategic planning, and that effective strategy making occurs on a continual basis and is a shared activity of the entire organization. This innovative book provides the first in-depth look at how real organizations are formulating and implementing strategic change under this new paradigm. The authors have dug deep into three large and varied organizations (Hewlett-Packard, the California State University system, and the County of Los Angeles) and identified each one's efforts to develop a new strategic planning process better-suited to match the current pace of change and environmental unpredictability. The book is filled with vignettes, quotes, and real-world examples that illustrate the trend toward faster, more adaptive strategic planning processes. It is relevant for a wide range of business, governmental, and non-profit settings, and should be required reading in any course on strategic planning.",Hardcover,,192 pages,"

","For true success, it is critical for non-profit organizations to think strategically. In simple terms, they must assess: where they are now, where they want to be in the future, how they plan to get there, and who will have to do what by when. In addition, it's critical that they monitor their progress to be sure that things are going as planned. That is the essence of planning. It is the first of twelve very important questions your organization should consider carefully. To help your team with planning, they should first answer the last eleven questions. These pertain to all the key elements underlying your organization's purpose and operations. They will get to the heart of why a plan is needed to meet customer requirements and your own objectives. This book will introduce and discuss those eleven questions and then rigorously walk you through the sequential and logical steps of a strategic planning process. It will guide your organization in how to think strategically in all aspects of the work you are doing for your consumers or clients. It will show you how to use that thinking in developing and implementing a meaningful and dynamic plan for achieving all your objectives.",Paperback,,160 pages,"

Following in the footsteps of Rebecca West--whose engaging and seminal travelogue Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: a journey through Yugoslavia, was published in 1945 and is still considered a masterpiece--in addition to other key contemporary writers and commentators, White paints vivid and revealing pictures of the cultural lives and landscapes in this fascinating region; drawing on the views and ideas he finds there, and extensive interviews with politicians, writers, and artists. The Balkans are often unjustly depicted as a barbarous bridge between Europe and Asia, a territory that just can't help itself. Even sympathetic Western European writers have often ""taken sides"" in the way they've depicted this astonishing part of the world. White has gone in search of humor and humanity, as well as the historical background to these common misconceptions--though all the while he's conscious that he may well be just another fool in the Balkans.",Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The lives of the talented Aubrey children have long been clouded by their father's genius for instability, but his new job in the London suburbs promises, for a time at least, reprieve from scandal and the threat of ruin. Mrs. Aubrey, a former concert pianist, struggles to keep the family afloat, but then she is something of a high-strung eccentric herself, as is all too clear to her daughter Rose, through whose loving but sometimes cruel eyes events are seen. Still, living on the edge holds the promise of the unexpected, and the Aubreys, who encounter furious poltergeists, turn up hidden masterpieces, and come to the aid of a murderess, will find that they have adventure to spare.In The Fountain Overflows, a 1957 best seller, Rebecca West transmuted her own volatile childhood into enduring art. This is an unvarnished but affectionate picture of an extraordinary family, in which a remarkable stylist and powerful intelligence surveys the elusive boundaries of childhood and adulthood, freedom and dependency, the ordinary and the occult.",Paperback,,408 pages,"

","Like most all of Rebecca West's reportage, A Train of Powder approaches great literature. Written between 1946 and 1954, these accounts of four controversial trials explore the nature of crime and punishment, innocence and guilt, retribution and forgiveness. The centerpiece of the book is ""Greenhouse with Cyclamens,"" a three-part essay on the Nuremberg trials written with precision, clarity, and daring insight. She also reports on two particularly brutal murder trials -- one for a lynching in North Carolina, the other for a ""torso murder"" in England -- and the espionage trial of a British telegrapher. Throughout, the question of guilt inspires Ms. West to feats of psychological detection wherein unerring craftsmanship and a powerful narrative sense combine to a high purpose -- the pursuit of truth. ""An astonishing book.... As compelling as Court TV but without the frisson of voyeurism (and with the compensatory satisfactions of West's breathtakingly lucid prose style), these elegant narratives remind us of the preciousness and fragility of our right to trial by jury.""--Francine Prose. ""It is her unique magic to combine impressionism and precision, as if Monet and Ingres could somehow be fused. Time and again a passage begins as a sort of iridescent cloud, and culminates in a diamond point.""--Telford Taylor, Saturday Review. ""Rebecca West...has raised journalism to a high art, breathing into it a depth, a poetry, a subtlety, and an understanding and compassion for human beings and their endless follies and tragedies that give it a legitimate place in contemporary literature.""--William L.

","After completing his biography of Rebecca West in 1995, Carl Rollyson felt bereft. As his wife said, 'Rebecca was such good company."" He had already embarked on another biography, but Rebecca kept beckoning him. He felt there was more to say about her politics-a misunderstood part of her repertoire as reporter and novelist. And had he done justice to her enormous sense of fun and humor? He regretted excising the portrait of her he wanted to put at the beginning of his biography. His editor kept cutting away at what he called Rollyson's doorstop of a book. And then after years of waiting, Rollyson received her FBI file. He kept running into Rebecca, so to speak, when he was working on his biographies of Martha Gellhorn and Jill Craigie. Interviews in London often turned up people who had known West as well. Thus piece by piece, Rollyson accumulated what is now another book about Rebecca West. This new collection tells the story of how his biography got written, of what it means to think like a biographer, and why West's vision remains relevant. She is one of the great personalities and writers of the modern age, and one that we are just beginning to comprehend.",Paperback,,132 pages,"

Despite the acclaim she attracted throughout her life, her books were often best sellers, though her work has undeservedly fallen out of fashion.  Rollyson has had exclusive access to West's vast archive of letters, diaries, journals and manuscripts; interviewed her friends and family, many of whom speak out for the first time. He reveals new details about her affairs with H.G. Wells (by whom she had a son); the press magnate, Lord Beaverbrook; the renowned journalist, John Gunther; the Nuremberg judge, Francis Biddle; Charlie Chaplin and others. In a life of extremes, she was seen as a feminist, an evil mother, an ardent anti-Communist, and a gossip. When she died on the Ides of March 1983, aged 90, she was a Dame of the British Empire and had finally made it to the screen in Reds, a heroine of her age.",Paperback,,480 pages,"

","The unique format of this book will get students talking whether they're actors or not! Duologs are not scenes for two people; rather, they are a pair of monologs about the same subject but from different viewpoints. Likewise, triologs offer three perspectives on the same topic, without the actors ever interacting. These can be great tools for opening up subjects for discussion or debate. Even the standard single monologs including in this creative collection touch on issues ripe for discussion for middle and high school students. The subject material of all these monologs, ranging from one to three minutes maximum, is honest and true to life. Best of all, you don't have to worry about inappropriate language or situations. These monologs don't skirt important issues that teens face today, but each situation is handled in a way that allows the actor, not the language, to be center stage. Monologs range from light-hearted topics -- blind dates, babysitting blues, and fender benders -- to more sensitive ones such as family problems, drunk driving, and suicide.",Paperback,,222 pages,"

","For many of us, the return of Zen conjures up images of rock gardens and gently flowing waterfalls. We think of mindfulness and meditation, immersion in a state of being where meaning is found through simplicity. Zen lore has been absorbed by Western practitioners and pop culture alike, yet there is a specific area of this ancient tradition that hasn’t been fully explored in the West. Now, in The Zen of Creativity, American Zen master John Daido Loori presents a book that taps the principles of the Zen arts and aesthetic as a means to unlock creativity and find freedom in the various dimensions of our existence. Loori dissolves the barriers between art and spirituality, opening up the possibility of meeting life with spontaneity, grace, and peace.Zen Buddhism is steeped in the arts. In spiritual ways, calligraphy, poetry, painting, the tea ceremony, and flower arranging can point us toward our essential, boundless nature. Brilliantly interpreting the teachings of the artless arts, Loori illuminates various elements that awaken our creativity, among them still point, the center of each moment that focuses on the tranquility within; simplicity, in which the creative process is uncluttered and unlimited, like a cloudless sky; spontaneity, a way to navigate through life without preconceptions, with a freshness in which everything becomes new; mystery, a sense of trust in the unknown; creative feedback, the systematic use of an audience to receive noncritical input about our art; art koans, exercises based on paradoxical questions that can be resolved only through artistic expression. Loori shows how these elements interpenetrate and function not only in art, but in all our endeavors.Beautifully illustrated and punctuated with poems and reflections from Loori’s own spiritual journey, The Zen of Creativity presents a multilayered, bottomless source of insight into our creativity. Appealing equally to spiritual seekers, artists, and veteran Buddhist practitioners, this book is perfect for those wishing to discover new means of self-awareness and expression—and to restore equanimity and freedom amid the vicissitudes of our lives.From the Hardcover edition.",Paperback,,272 pages,"

","In Science, Order and Creativity, David Bohm and F. David Peat argue that science has lost its way in recent years and needs to go beyond a narrow and fragmented view of nature and embrace a wider holistic view that restores the importance of creativity and communication for all humanity - not just scientists. The result of a close collaboration by one of the 20th century's greatest physicists and thinkers, David Bohm, with leading science writer F. David Peat, provides a rare combination of profound reflection and clear exposition that can be appreciated by anyone concerned with science and its importance in our lives. This new edition includes a new preface and an extended additional chapter by Peat which draws upon further discussions with David Bohm before the latter's death in 1992. A fascinating diagnosis and considered proposal for a cure for science's ills, it is also very accessible entry point to the work of David Bohm. Bohm and Peat contend that science has lost its bearings in the last century in favour of a narrow, abstracted, fragmented approach to nature and reality. Tracing the history of science, Bohm and Peat offer intriguing new insights into how scientific theories come into being, how to eliminate blocks of creativity and how science can lead to a deeper understanding of society, the human condition and the human mind itself.",Paperback,Second Edition,328 pages,"
