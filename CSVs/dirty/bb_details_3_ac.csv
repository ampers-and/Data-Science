","Dare Lá Roche besucht, seit sie vierzehn ist, die Akademie Sankt Loryane in Frankreich, auf der nur ausgewählte Mädchen mit besonderem Blut aufgenommen werden, um nach der Vollendung des einundzwanzigsten Lebensjahres ihrem Vampir übergeben zu werden. Während die anderen Mädchen sich nichts sehnlicher wünschen, als ihrem Vampir zu begegnen, glaubt Dare zu wissen, was Vampire in Wirklichkeit sind. Nicht die Beschützer der seltenen Mädchen – nein, sondern eine Art, die Menschen terrorisiert und für ihre Zwecke ausnutzt. Daher wird Dare alles mögliche tun, um ihrem zukünftigen Vampir, Lazares Descartes, zu entkommen. Wird ihr eine Flucht gelingen? Oder wird sie sich mit dem Fehltritt nur den Zorn des Vampirs zuziehen?  GEFALLENE MÄDCHEN – ist der erste Band der Vampirreihe, die in eine düstere, neuartige und sinnliche Welt entführt. Eine Geschichte, die von einem selbstbewussten Mädchen erzählt, das die Welt der Vampire völlig verändern wird. Denn Dare ist die Eine, nach der viele Vampire vergeblich suchen.  Der zweite Band erscheint voraussichtlich Ende April 2016.",,,Kindle Edition,,392 pages,"

","For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space all their own. His surreal fictions, which deftly mix the everyday with the extraordinary, have won him a devoted following. Now, in Glass Soup, Carroll continues to astound . . . .The realm of the dead is built from the dreams--and nightmares--of the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads to hell.Once before, Vincent Ettrich and his lover, Isabelle Neukor, crossed over from life to death and back again. Now Isabelle bears a very special child, who may someday restore the ever-changing mosaic that is reality. Unless the agents of Chaos can lure her back to the land of the dead--and trap her there forever.Glass Soup is another exquisite and singular creation from the author January magazine described as ""incapable of writing a bad book much less an uninteresting one.""",0765311801,9780765311801),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A trajetória de Liesel Meminger é contada por uma narradora mórbida, surpreendentemente simpática. Ao perceber que a pequena ladra de livros lhe escapa, a Morte afeiçoa-se à menina e rastreia suas pegadas de 1939 a 1943. Traços de uma sobrevivente: a mãe comunista, perseguida pelo nazismo, envia Liesel e o irmão para o subúrbio pobre de uma cidade alemã, onde um casal se dispõe a adotá-los por dinheiro. O garoto morre no trajeto e é enterrado por um coveiro que deixa cair um livro na neve. É o primeiro de uma série que a menina vai surrupiar ao longo dos anos. O único vínculo com a família é esta obra, que ela ainda não sabe ler.Assombrada por pesadelos, ela compensa o medo e a solidão das noites com a conivência do pai adotivo, um pintor de parede bonachão que lhe dá lições de leitura. Alfabetizada sob vistas grossas da madrasta, Liesel canaliza urgências para a literatura. Em tempos de livros incendiados, ela os furta, ou os lê na biblioteca do prefeito da cidade.A vida ao redor é a pseudorrealidade criada em torno do culto a Hitler na Segunda Guerra. Ela assiste à eufórica celebração do aniversário do Führer pela vizinhança. Teme a dona da loja da esquina, colaboradora do Terceiro Reich. Faz amizade com um garoto obrigado a integrar a Juventude Hitlerista. E ajuda o pai a esconder no porão um judeu que escreve livros artesanais para contar a sua parte naquela História. A Morte, perplexa diante da violência humana, dá um tom leve e divertido à narrativa deste duro confronto entre a infância perdida e a crueldade do mundo adulto, um sucesso absoluto - e raro - de crítica e público.",8598078174,9788598078175),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","For Ta-Nehisi Coates, history has always been personal. At every stage of his life, he's sought in his explorations of history answers to the mysteries that surrounded him -- most urgently, why he, and other black people he knew, seemed to live in fear. What were they afraid of? Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings -- moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield with a rogue historian, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's 'long war on black people,' or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. In his trademark style -- a mix of lyrical personal narrative, reimagined history, essayistic argument, and reportage -- Coates provides readers a thrillingly illuminating new framework for understanding race: its history, our contemporary dilemma, and where we go from here.",,,Kindle Edition,,163 pages,"

A supervisioná-los está Ralph, um jovem ponderado, e o seu amigo gorducho e esperto, Piggy. Apesar de Ralph tentar impor a ordem e delegar responsabilidades, muitos dos rapazes preferem celebrar a ausência de adultos nadando, brincando ou caçando a grande população de porcos selvagens que habita a ilha. O mais feroz adversário de Ralph é Jack, o líder dos caçadores, que consegue arrastar consigo a maioria dos rapazes. No entanto, à medida que o tempo passa, o frágil sentido de ordem desmorona-se. Os seus medos alcançam um significado sinistro e primitivo, até Ralph descobrir que ele e Piggy se tornaram nos alvos de caça dos restantes rapazes, embriagados pela sensação aparente de poder.",9722047973,9789722047975),Paperback,,264 pages,"

"," A new series from the author of the acclaimed Beaumont and Beasley novels!  In the year 1790, monster hunter Ichabod Crane searched for a mysterious creature called the Headless Horseman. His quest ended in an embarrassing failure that marked his family with disgrace for generations.  Now, in 1891, his descendant Todd Crane is determined to prove that the Horseman is real. There's just one problem--Todd is a professional con artist and a seller of unlicensed magic potions. This puts him on the wrong side of the law and right in the crosshairs of US Marshal Amy Crockett.  As the Horseman returns to menace the western frontier, Todd and Amy must join forces to stop the monster once and for all. But if they're going to succeed, they'll have to make sacrifices that will change their lives forever.  Enter a Wild West where centaurs wear six-shooters and monsters roam the plains.

Now, only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer; Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom; and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people.

They take walks in the park together, visit county fairs, museums, and zoos, and eat together overlooking the lake. Some might say the father is a little too accommodating given the lack of discipline when the child loses his temper in public. Some might say he spoils his son by allowing him to set his own bedtimes and eat candy whenever he wants. Some might say that such leniency is starting to take its toll on the father, given how his health has declined.What no one knows is that Phil is a prisoner, and that up until a few weeks ago and a chance encounter at a grocery store, he had never seen the child before in his life.A new novella from the Bram Stoker Award-winning author of THE TURTLE BOY and KIN.",,,Kindle Edition,,67 pages,"

","Beverly Daniel Tatum emerged on the national scene in 1997 with ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?,"" a book that spoke to a wide audience about the psychological dynamics of race relations in America. Tatum's unique ability to get people talking about race captured the attention of many, from Oprah Winfrey to President Clinton, who invited her to join him in his nationally televised dialogues on race.In her first book since that pathbreaking success, Tatum starts with a warning call about the increasing but underreported resegregation of America. A self-described ""integration baby""--she was born in 1954--Tatum sees our growing isolation from each other as deeply problematic, and she believes that schools can be key institutions for forging connections across the racial divide.In this ambitious, accessible book, Tatum examines some of the most resonant issues in American education and race relations: -The need of African American students to see themselves reflected in curricula and institutions-How unexamined racial attitudes can negatively affect minority-student achievement-The possibilities--and complications--of intimate crossracial friendshipsTatum approaches all these topics with the blend of analysis and storytelling that make her one of our most persuasive and engaging commentators on race.Can We Talk About Race? launches a collaborative lecture and book series between Beacon Press and Simmons College, which aims to reinvigorate a crucial national public conversation on race, education and democracy.""What Tatum seeks to do above all is trigger sometimes challenging discussions about race, and infuse those discussions with a reality-based focus on how race affects us all. Her latest book does that beautifully, asking touch questions, and patiently, inclusively seeking answers."" --Boston Globe Beverly Daniel Tatum is author of Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? and Assimilation Blues.

","Alvirah Meehan, the former cleaning lady from Flushing, New York, who struck it rich in the lottery, made her first appearance in Mary Higgins Clark's Weep No More, My Lady. After she narrowly survived a stalking killer in that best-selling novel, grateful fans clamored for her return. Mary Higgins Clark obliged with several splendid short stories starring the ever-resourceful Alvirah and her occasionally befuddled but always dependable mate, Willy. Here are Alvirah and Willy, ensconced in their spacious Central Park South condo, surrounded by the rich and famous, some of whom just can't go on living (The Body in the Closet). But then Alvirah has become something of a celebrity herself and even appears on the Donahue show, thereby giving unfortunate ideas to a bunch of kidnappers who demand a hefty ransom for her hapless hubby (Plumbing for Willy). When they're not solving dastardly crimes or extricating themselves from danger in Manhattan, Alvirah and Willy like to escape to Cape Cod. Even there, however, they find plenty to keep Alvirah's steel-trap mind occupied (Death on the Cape), not to mention solving the problems of a fellow lottery winner in distress (A Clean Sweep), or returning to the Cypress Point Spa to solve a brutal slaying among the rich and beautiful (The Lottery Winner), or - as a surprise - the unexpected bonus of a Willy and Alvirah Christmas tale of suspense (Bye, Baby Bunting).",,,Mass Market Paperback,,261 pages,"

","An iconic teacher. A warm friend. A generous mentor.For more than 40 years, Howard Stevenson has been a towering figure at Harvard Business School: the man who literally defined entrepreneurship and taught thousands of the world’s most successful professionals.Now – spurred by Stevenson’s heart-stopping brush with death – his student, colleague, and dear friend Eric Sinoway shares the man’s wisdom and inspiration. Through warm and engaging conversations, we hear Howard’s timeless and practical lessons on pursuing both success and fulfillment, beginning with:• Create a vision of your own legacy through a process called “business planning for life.”• Be entrepreneurial in driving your career ahead (even if you’re not an entrepreneur).• Exploit the inflection points in your life – whether “friend,” “foe,” or “silent.”• Cut risk in tough career and life decisions by shining the “light of predictability” on them.• Plan for the ripples, not just the splash from your actions and choices. Reading Howard’s Gift is like having a wise, caring friend sit down and say, “Let’s figure all this out together.”And the deeply personal perspectives from guest contributors – such as CNN correspondent Soledad O’Brien, Teach for America Founder Wendy Kopp, two-time Super Bowl Champion Carl Banks, and legendary MTV Founder Bob Pittman – reinforce the practical lessons in this clear-sighted book that will help readers “define success in their own terms,” and “live a life with no regrets.” ",1250004241,9781250004246),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Isaac Asimov – při tomto jménu se všem příznivcům a čtenářům SF vybaví dvě věci – románový cyklus Nadace a hlavně tři zákony robotiky. Jakže znějí? 1. Robot nesmí ublížit člověku nebo svou nečinností dopustit, aby člověku bylo ublíženo. 2. Robot musí uposlechnout příkazů člověka, kromě případů, kdy tyto příkazy jsou v rozporu s prvním zákonem. 3. Robot musí chránit sám sebe před zničením, kromě případů, kdy tato ochrana je v rozporu s prvním nebo druhým zákonem. Tvůrcem a otcem celé robotické etiky je právě americký spisovatel Isaac Asimov.

","In this genre-bending novel, there is no such thing as chance and every action is carefully executed by highly trained agents. You’ll never looks at coincidences the same way again.What if the drink you just spilled, the train you just missed, or the lottery ticket you just found was not just a random occurrence? What if it’s all part of a bigger plan? What if there’s no such thing as a chance encounter? What if there are people we don’t know determining our destiny? And what if they are even planning the fate of the world?Enter the Coincidence Makers—Guy, Emily, and Eric—three seemingly ordinary people who work for a secret organization devoted to creating and carrying out coincidences. What the rest of the world sees as random occurrences, are, in fact, carefully orchestrated events designed to spark significant changes in the lives of their targets—scientists on the brink of breakthroughs, struggling artists starved for inspiration, loves to be, or just plain people like you and me…When an assignment of the highest level is slipped under Guy’s door one night, he knows it will be the most difficult and dangerous coincidence he’s ever had to fulfill. But not even a coincidence maker can see how this assignment is about to change all their lives and teach them the true nature of fate, free will, and the real meaning of love.",1250146119,9781250146113),Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","Historyâ��s Greatest BeautyTells the Story of Her LifeGossips began whispering about Princess Helen from the moment of her birth. A daughter of the royal house of Sparta, she was not the progeny of King Tyndareus, they murmured, but of Zeus, king of the gods. Her mother, Queen Leda, a powerful priestess, was branded an adulteress, with tragic consequences. As Helen grew to adulthood her beauty was so breathtaking it overshadowed that of every woman in Sparta. When she was kidnapped by Theseus, king of Athens, in a gambit to replenish his kingdomâ��s coffers, she was relieved to get away from the place where she had been so unhappy.Helen fell in love with the much older Theseus, and to his surprise, he returned the feelings. But soon Helen was forced to return to Sparta and was hastily married off to the tepid Menelaus for the sake of an advantageous political alliance. After years of marriage, the spirited, passionate Helen was not the docile wife King Menelaus desired, and when she fell in love with another manâ��Paris Alexandros, the prodigal son of King Priam of Troyâ��Helen unwittingly set the stage for the ultimate conflict: a war that would destroy nearly all she held dear.In this lush, compelling novel of passion and loss, Helen of Troy, a true survivor, tells the truth about her life, her lovers, and the Trojan War.

Vincent, le fils aîné, projette la création d'un parc d'attractions sur le thème du suicide. Sa sœur, Marilyn, qui se croit moche et inutile, voudrait en finir avec l'existence, mais ses parents lui rappellent que : ""Chez les Tuvache, on ne peut pas se suicider parce que sinon qui tiendrait le magasin?""Dans cette famille malheureuse et contente de l'être, le destin a frappé le jour où Mishima et Lucrèce ont testé un préservatif poreux destiné à ceux qui veulent mourir par contamination sexuelle. C'est ainsi qu'est né le petit dernier, Alan, que la nature a doté d'un horrible défaut : il adore la vie. Un enfant pareil, c'est un coup du sort. Il console les clients, sème une joyeuse pagaille avec son sens de l'humour et ses chansons.

","Only days have passed since Vie Eliot’s murderous half-brother—a dangerous, out-of-control psychic—was stopped from killing the people Vie loves most, but Vie is ready for his life to return to normal. He has plans. Big plans. Make the cross country team, pick up his grades, and spend a lot of time with his boyfriend.  On the day of cross country tryouts, though, Vie finds one of the teachers dead—and Vie refuses to believe that the death was a suicide. As he searches for the killer, or killers, he discovers that a conspiracy exists in the small town of Vehpese: a conspiracy that might be older and deeper than Vie first suspects, a conspiracy of drugs and human trafficking that might also be tied, in some way Vie can’t quite understand, to his own abilities—and to the other psychic abilities in his town.  When the murderers turn their attention to Vie, though, he discovers that his powers might not be up to the task. He faces ghosts, ancient monsters, and even an evil substitute teacher, but unless he can confront his past, and the trauma that lies there, he might not manage to save the people he cares about.  He might not even survive himself. ",,,Kindle Edition,,567 pages,"

The Revolutionary War as never told before.
The breathtaking latest installment in Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard’s mega-bestselling Killing series transports readers to the most important era in our nation’s history, the Revolutionary War. Told through the eyes of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Great Britain’s King George III, Killing England chronicles the path to independence in gripping detail, taking the reader from the battlefields of America to the royal courts of Europe. What started as protest and unrest in the colonies soon escalated to a world war with devastating casualties.O’Reilly and Dugard recreate the war’s landmark battles, including Bunker Hill, Long Island, Saratoga, and Yorktown, revealing the savagery of hand-to-hand combat and the often brutal conditions under which these brave American soldiers lived and fought. Also here is the reckless treachery of Benedict Arnold and the daring guerilla tactics of the “Swamp Fox” Frances Marion.A must read, Killing England reminds one and all how the course of history can be changed through the courage and determination of those intent on doing the impossible.",1427290393,9781427290397),Audio CD,,,"

","The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea by Sebastian Junger. It was the storm of the century - a tempest created by so rare a combination of factors that meteorologists deemed it ""the perfect storm."" When it struck in October, 1991, there was virtually no warning. ""She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong,"" radioed Captain Billy Tyne of the Andrea Gail from off the coast of Nova Scotia. Soon afterward, the boat and its crew of six disappeared without a trace. The Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller, a stark and compelling journey into the dark heart of nature that leaves listeners with a breathless sense of what it feels like to be caught, helpless, in the grip of a force beyond understanding or control.",006101351X,9780061013515),Paperback,,301 pages,"

","Mein Name ist Sixten. Ich denke, ich war ein durchschnittlicher Absteiger: unterbezahlt, launisch, schlecht zu sprechen auf das Leben und die ach so verkommene Welt. Da war mein kleines Drogenproblem, diese nervenaufreibenden Sitzungen bei Doktor Mattson und Nils, der seit der Grundschule nicht gelernt hat, länger als zehn Stunden sauer auf mich zu sein. Summa summarum war mein Leben Mist, aber unkompliziert genug, um den Pessimismus in die tägliche Routine einfließen zu lassen. Ich hätte genau so weiter gemacht, wäre nicht alles plötzlich unwirklich geworden. Auf einmal soll ich ein Todsünder sein und der Sklave eines Dämons werden – das behauptet zumindest die sprechende Katze, die will, dass ich sie Meisterin nenne. Vielleicht habe ich auch Wahnvorstellungen von der Kokserei bekommen, aber so oder so, mein Leben braucht eine Kehrtwende. Dann muss ich mich eben damit abfinden, dass es Himmel und Hölle gibt, auch wenn ich bisher Atheist war. Ich war auch ein Arschloch und finde mich damit ab, dass ich die Dämonen-Katze, die mich verschachern will, irgendwie mag. Einer von uns wird trotzdem verlieren.

","Kweku Sai is dead. A renowned surgeon and failed husband, he succumbs suddenly at dawn outside his home in suburban Accra. The news of Kweku’s death sends a ripple around the world, bringing together the family he abandoned years before. Ghana Must Go is their story. Electric, exhilarating, beautifully crafted, Ghana Must Go is a testament to the transformative power of unconditional love, from a debut novelist of extraordinary talent.  Moving with great elegance through time and place, Ghana Must Go charts the Sais’ circuitous journey to one another. In the wake of Kweku’s death, his children gather in Ghana at their enigmatic mother’s new home. The eldest son and his wife; the mysterious, beautiful twins; the baby sister, now a young woman: each carries secrets of his own. What is revealed in their coming together is the story of how they came apart: the hearts broken, the lies told, the crimes committed in the name of love. Splintered, alone, each navigates his pain, believing that what has been lost can never be recovered—until, in Ghana, a new way forward, a new family, begins to emerge.Ghana Must Go is at once a portrait of a modern family, and an exploration of the importance of where we come from to who we are. In a sweeping narrative that takes us from Accra to Lagos to London to New York, Ghana Must Go teaches that the truths we speak can heal the wounds we hide.",1594204497,9781594204494),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.This new edition includes the fiftieth-anniversary fully corrected text setting and, for the first time, an extensive new index.J.R.R.

Inimsoo jätkamiseks on kehtestatud ranged reeglid: laste saamiseks valitakse geneetiliselt sobivad paarid, kõik lapsed viljastatakse kunstlikult ja füüsiline kontakt vastassoost isikutega on keelatud.Teismeline tüdruk Cordevia lahkub mõneks ajaks baasist ja teda hammustab tundmatu mürgine liblikas. Tema elu päästab teadmata kust välja ilmunud võõras võluv noormees Clay, kes on aga veelgi ohtlikum kui liblikas. Cordevia saab isalt käsu uurida Claylt välja, kust too poiss pärineb ja kus leidub veel elusat loodust. Ülesannet on aga suisa võimatu täita, sest tüdrukul pole aimugi, kuidas võita poisi usaldust. Pealegi on ta noormehesse ülepeakaela armunud.Kui Clay otsustab baasist lahkuda, on Cordevia nõus pigem surema kui temast lahkuma. Clayl ei jää muud üle, kui võtta Cordevia endaga kaasa maailma, mis on palju ilusam, värvilisem ja mitmekesisem Cordevia omast. Ent see kaunis maailm kubiseb salakavalatest ohtudest.

","The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus, commonly referred to simply as Doctor Faustus, is an Elizabethan tragedy by Christopher Marlowe, based on German stories about the title character Faust, that was first performed sometime between 1588 and Marlowe's death in 1593. Two different versions of the play were published in the Jacobean era, several years later. The powerful effect of early productions of the play is indicated by the legends that quickly accrued around them—that actual devils once appeared on the stage during a performance, ""to the great amazement of both the actors and spectators"", a sight that was said to have driven some spectators mad.",8804361212,9788804361213),Paperback,,208 pages,"

","Tyrants cut out hearts. Rulers sacrifice their own. Princess Hesina of Yan has always been eager to shirk the responsibilities of the crown, but when her beloved father is murdered, she's thrust into power, suddenly the queen of an unstable kingdom. Determined to find her father's killer, Hesina does something desperate: she engages the aid of a soothsayer—a treasonous act, punishable by death… because in Yan, magic was outlawed centuries ago. Using the information illicitly provided by the sooth, and uncertain if she can trust even her family, Hesina turns to Akira—a brilliant investigator who's also a convicted criminal with secrets of his own. With the future of her kingdom at stake, can Hesina find justice for her father? Or will the cost be too high?

","Now a major motion picture starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson!In this #1 New York Times bestselling novel that’s perfect for fans of John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars, two teens fall in love with just one minor complication—they can’t get within a few feet of each other without risking their lives.Can you love someone you can never touch?Stella Grant likes to be in control—even though her totally out of control lungs have sent her in and out of the hospital most of her life. At this point, what Stella needs to control most is keeping herself away from anyone or anything that might pass along an infection and jeopardize the possibility of a lung transplant. Six feet apart. No exceptions.The only thing Will Newman wants to be in control of is getting out of this hospital. He couldn’t care less about his treatments, or a fancy new clinical drug trial. Soon, he’ll turn eighteen and then he’ll be able to unplug all these machines and actually go see the world, not just its hospitals.Will’s exactly what Stella needs to stay away from. If he so much as breathes on Stella she could lose her spot on the transplant list. Either one of them could die. The only way to stay alive is to stay apart. But suddenly six feet doesn’t feel like safety. It feels like punishment.What if they could steal back just a little bit of the space their broken lungs have stolen from them? Would five feet apart really be so dangerous if it stops their hearts from breaking too?",1534451560,9781534451568),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","In his bestselling The Moral Animal, Robert Wright applied the principles of evolutionary biology to the study of the human mind. Now Wright attempts something even more ambitious: explaining the direction of evolution and human history–and discerning where history will lead us next.In Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny, Wright asserts that, ever since the primordial ooze, life has followed a basic pattern. Organisms and human societies alike have grown more complex by mastering the challenges of internal cooperation. Wright's narrative ranges from fossilized bacteria to vampire bats, from stone-age villages to the World Trade Organization, uncovering such surprises as the benefits of barbarian hordes and the useful stability of feudalism. Here is history endowed with moral significance–a way of looking at our biological and cultural evolution that suggests, refreshingly, that human morality has improved over time, and that our instinct to discover meaning may itself serve a higher purpose. Insightful, witty, profound, Nonzero offers breathtaking implications for what we believe and how we adapt to technology's ongoing transformation of the world.From the Trade Paperback edition.",,,Kindle Edition,,450 pages,"

How does he manage to exude childlike enthusiasm, and bring such deep commitment to his work?You’ve seen most of the things that Piyush Pandey has seen in his life. You’ve seen cobblers, carpenters, cricketers, trains, villages, towns and cities. What makes Piyush different is the perspective from which he views the same things you’ve seen, his ability to store all that he sees into some recesses of his brain and then retrieve them at short notice when he needs to. That ability combined with his love, passion and understanding of advertising and of consumers make him the master storyteller that he is. In Pandeymonium, Piyush talks about his influences, right from his childhood in Jaipur and being a Ranji cricketer, to his philosophy, failures and lessons in advertising in particular and life in general.

","In this masterpiece about freedom, feminism, and destiny, Printz Honor author A.S. King tells the epic story of a girl coping with devastating loss at long last--a girl who has no idea that the future needs her, and that the present needs her even more.Graduating from high school is a time of limitless possibilities--but not for Glory, who has no plan for what's next. Her mother committed suicide when Glory was only four years old, and she's never stopped wondering if she will eventually go the same way...until a transformative night when she begins to experience an astonishing new power to see a person's infinite past and future. From ancient ancestors to many generations forward, Glory is bombarded with visions--and what she sees ahead of her is terrifying: A tyrannical new leader raises an army. Women's rights disappear. A violent second civil war breaks out. And young girls vanish daily, sold off or interned in camps. Glory makes it her mission to record everything she sees, hoping her notes will somehow make a difference. She may not see a future for herself, but she'll do anything to make sure this one doesn't come to pass.",,,Kindle Edition,,308 pages,"

","(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) Evelyn Waugh’s most celebrated novel is a memory drama about the intense entanglement of the narrator, Charles Ryder, with a great Anglo-Catholic family. Written during World War II, the novel mourns the passing of the aristocratic world Waugh knew in his youth and vividly recalls the sensuous pleasures denied him by wartime austerities; in so doing it also provides a profound study of the conflict between the demands of religion and the desires of the flesh. At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, Brideshead Revisited transcends Waugh’s familiar satiric exploration of his cast of lords and ladies, Catholics and eccentrics, artists and misfits, revealing him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity. The edition reprinted here contains Waugh’s revisions, made in 1959, and his preface to the revised edition.",0140008217,9780140008210),Paperback,,331 pages,"

","When we look at a painting hanging on an art gallery wall, we see only what the artist has chosen to disclose--the finished work of art. What remains mysterious is the process of creation itself--the making of the work of art. Everyone who has looked at paintings has wondered about this, and numerous efforts have been made to discover and depict the creative method of important artists. A Giacometti Portrait is a picture of one of the century's greatest artists at work.James Lord sat for eighteen days while his friend Alberto Giamcometti did his portrait in oil. The artist painted, and the model recorded the sittings and took photographs of the work in its various stages. What emerged was an illumination of what it is to be an artist and what it was to be Giacometti--a portrait in prose of the man and his art. A work of great literarydistinction, A Giacometti Portrait is, above all, a subtle and important evocation of a great artist.",0374515735,9780374515737),Paperback,,128 pages,"

","Crazy Rich Asians is the outrageously funny debut novel about three super-rich, pedigreed Chinese families and the gossip, backbiting, and scheming that occurs when the heir to one of the most massive fortunes in Asia brings home his ABC (American-born Chinese) girlfriend to the wedding of the season.When Rachel Chu agrees to spend the summer in Singapore with her boyfriend, Nicholas Young, she envisions a humble family home, long drives to explore the island, and quality time with the man she might one day marry. What she doesn't know is that Nick's family home happens to look like a palace, that she'll ride in more private planes than cars, and that with one of Asia's most eligible bachelors on her arm, Rachel might as well have a target on her back.Initiated into a world of dynastic splendor beyond imagination, Rachel meets Astrid, the It Girl of Singapore society; Eddie, whose family practically lives in the pages of the Hong Kong socialite magazines; and Eleanor, Nick's formidable mother, a woman who has very strong feelings about who her son should--and should not--marry. Uproarious, addictive, and filled with jaw-dropping opulence, Crazy Rich Asians is an insider's look at the Asian JetSet; a perfect depiction of the clash between old money and new money; between Overseas Chinese and Mainland Chinese; and a fabulous novel about what it means to be young, in love, and gloriously, crazily rich.",0804127646,9780804127646),Audio CD,,14 pages,"

Casey and Pamela Riordan have fled the erupting violence of Belfast, Northern Ireland, only to find themselves tangled in the web of political corruption that permeates South Boston. Here, a man's life can hang upon the whim of another, and neighborhood politics and organized crime are one and the same. While Pamela appears to flourish in the arena of Boston Irish society, Casey struggles to survive in a sphere where his presence has become increasingly inconvenient. Betrayed and blackmailed by friend and foe, the Riordans are forced to make desperate choices that bear heavy consequences. In the wake of tragedy, they return to Ireland and an alliance with James Kirkpatrick. It is here the bonds of love are tested - by the bloody price of rebellion, a past that is fraught with dangers of its own, friendships that carry a steep price, and a secret that threatens to tear their lives apart. Set against the backdrop of the gritty streets of Southie and the heartbreaking beauty of Ireland, 'Mermaid in a Bowl of Tears' is a tale of the invincibility of the human spirit, imbued with the passion, humor and magic inherent to the Emerald Isle.",0978357000,9780978357009),Paperback,,768 pages,"

","In the late seventeenth century two penniless young Frenchmen, René Sel and Charles Duquet, arrive in New France. Bound to a feudal lord, a “seigneur,” for three years in exchange for land, they become wood-cutters—barkskins. René suffers extraordinary hardship, oppressed by the forest he is charged with clearing. He is forced to marry a Mi’kmaw woman and their descendants live trapped between two inimical cultures. But Duquet, crafty and ruthless, runs away from the seigneur, becomes a fur trader, then sets up a timber business. Proulx tells the stories of the descendants of Sel and Duquet over three hundred years—their travels across North America, to Europe, China, and New Zealand, under stunningly brutal conditions—the revenge of rivals, accidents, pestilence, Indian attacks, and cultural annihilation. Over and over again, they seize what they can of a presumed infinite resource, leaving the modern-day characters face to face with possible ecological collapse.",0743288785,9780743288781),Hardcover,,717 pages,"

","Like so many others, Ramon Espejo ran from the poverty and hopelessness of the Third World to the promise of a new world--joining a host of like-minded workers and dreamers aboard one of the great starships of the mysterious, repulsive Enye. But the life he found on the far-off planet of Sao Paulo was no better than the one he had abandoned.Tough, volatile, and angry--a luckless prospector hoping for that one rich strike that will make him wealthy--Ramon is content only when on his own out in the bush, far from the dirty, loud, bustling hive of humanity that he detests with sociopathic fervor. Then one night his rage and too much alcohol get the better of him, resulting in sudden bloodshed and a high-profile murder. Ramon is forced to flee into the wilderness for however long it will take for the furor to die down.Here, mercifully, almost happily alone, Ramon is once again free. But while searching for his long-elusive lode, he stumbles upon something completely unexpected: a highly advanced alien race in hiding; fugitives like himself on a world not their own. Suddenly in possession of a powerful, dangerous secret, Ramon must battle for his freedom from alien captors and also against the hostile and unpredictable planet. And so the chase begins.Police, fugitive aliens, and a human murderer weave a web of shifting alliances as Ramon enters the greatest manhunt the alien world of Sao Paulo has ever known. If he is to survive, Ramon must overcome inscrutable aliens and deadly predators, but his greatest enemy is himself. With every move in the desperate game, he struggles to outwit his enemies and solve the mystery of a murder he himself committed.A rip-roaring adventure tale and character study of a fascinating and twisted mind, ""Hunter's Run"" showcases three masters of the form at their best.",006137329X,9780061373299),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Новеллы Стефана Цвейга. Золотая классика европейского психологического реализма начала XX века. Их экранизировали гении европейского и американского кино времен его «золотого века»: Роберт Ланд и Макс Офюльс, Этьен Перье и Роберт Сьодмак. На них выросли поколения европейских и российских читателей. Каждая из этих новелл и сейчас восхищает, повергает в ярость, заставляет спорить с автором и его героями, любить их и ненавидеть, осуждать и прощать. Секрет подобного «нестарения» новелл Цвейга прост — автор неизменно писал о страсти.

","Is there credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God? Retracing his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools like Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis who are recognized authorities in their own fields. Strobel challenges them with questions like; How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this award-winning book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ?

","More than twenty years ago, the first epic fantasy novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning. Now New York Times bestselling author Robin Hobb brings to a momentous close the third trilogy featuring these beloved characters in a novel of unsurpassed artistry that is sure to endure as one of the great masterworks of the genre.Fitz’s young daughter, Bee, has been kidnapped by the Servants, a secret society whose members not only dream of possible futures but use their prophecies to add to their wealth and influence. Bee plays a crucial part in these dreams—but just what part remains uncertain.As Bee is dragged by her sadistic captors across half the world, Fitz and the Fool, believing her dead, embark on a mission of revenge that will take them to the distant island where the Servants reside—a place the Fool once called home and later called prison. It was a hell the Fool escaped, maimed and blinded, swearing never to return.For all his injuries, however, the Fool is not as helpless as he seems. He is a dreamer too, able to shape the future. And though Fitz is no longer the peerless assassin of his youth, he remains a man to be reckoned with—deadly with blades and poison, and adept in Farseer magic. And their goal is simple: to make sure not a single Servant survives their scourge.",0553392956,9780553392951),Hardcover,,847 pages,"

And we were only a small part of it, a tiny dot in the gods’ empire. It was no wonder that they saw us as insignificant.”  Tested by the gods, Leda and her angelic mate Nero venture into the City of Ashes, a fallen fortress in the Western Wilderness where nightmarish monsters reign supreme and an ancient secret is buried. To survive the Gods’ Trials, they will have to save the city—and they will have to do it without their magic.  Their victory, however, comes at a heavy price. And the secret they uncover will upset the balance of power between Earth and heaven.  Shifter’s Shadow is the fifth book in the Legion of Angels series.   The Legion of Angels series

In Beasts, he demonstrates that the violence we perceive in the “wild” is a matter of projection.Animals predators kill to survive, but animal aggression is not even remotely equivalent to the violence of mankind. Humans are the most violent animals to our own kind in existence. We lack what all other animals have: a check on the aggression that would destroy the species rather than serve it. In Beasts, Masson brings to life the richness of the animal world and strips away our misconceptions of the creatures we fear, offering a powerful and compelling look at our uniquely human propensity toward aggression.",1608196151,9781608196159),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","From the New York Times bestselling author of An Enchantment of Ravens comes an imaginative fantasy about an apprentice at a magical library who must battle a powerful sorcerer to save her kingdom.All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer’s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery—magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains.

","«Sono Marguerite van Gogh. La signora Marguerite van Gogh. La moglie di Vincent. Sono vecchia e stanca, sto per andarmene, ma non rimpiangerò questa terra. Ritroverò Vincent e staremo insieme per sempre». Nella torrida estate del 1890, a Auvers-sur-Oise, un uomo si presenta a casa del dottor Gachet: dall’aspetto, Marguerite, figlia del medico, lo scambia per uno dei tanti braccianti agricoli che lavorano nella zona. L’uomo è Vincent van Gogh, e per Marguerite, che ama dipingere ma si dibatte tra l’insoddisfazione di non riuscire a creare nulla di apprezzabile e una condizione di figlia predestinata a un matrimonio borghese, egli assume, giorno dopo giorno, le fattezze del maestro, del genio, dell’amore. Guardandolo dipingere, la giovane vede ora i paesaggi in cui è cresciuta – le case dai tetti di paglia, le acque del fiume, i fiori, gli alberi, il cielo – con nuovi occhi: la potenza della vera arte si dispiega davanti a lei, mentre la relazione con Vincent si fa sempre più stretta, più pericolosa e infine fatale. Mettendo insieme, come nel Club degli incorreggibili ottimisti, potenza del racconto e verità documentaria, e consegnandoci pagine di vera poesia quando assistiamo insieme a Marguerite alla nascita dei capolavori di van Gogh, Guenassia fa rivivere l’epoca d’oro degli impressionisti e getta una nuova luce sulla tragica fine dell’artista e sui misteri che circondano alcune delle sue opere; e lo fa come sempre da un’angolatura originale, tratteggiando ancora una volta un’indimenticabile figura femminile.",889381093X,9788893810937),Paperback,Romanzo,280 pages,"

","Sancia Grado is a thief, and a damn good one. And her latest target, a heavily guarded warehouse on Tevanne’s docks, is nothing her unique abilities can’t handle.    But unbeknownst to her, Sancia’s been sent to steal an artifact of unimaginable power, an object that could revolutionize the magical technology known as scriving. The Merchant Houses who control this magic--the art of using coded commands to imbue everyday objects with sentience--have already used it to transform Tevanne into a vast, remorseless capitalist machine. But if they can unlock the artifact’s secrets, they will rewrite the world itself to suit their aims.    Now someone in those Houses wants Sancia dead, and the artifact for themselves. And in the city of Tevanne, there’s nobody with the power to stop them.    To have a chance at surviving—and at stopping the deadly transformation that’s under way—Sancia will have to marshal unlikely allies, learn to harness the artifact’s power for herself, and undergo her own transformation, one that will turn her into something she could never have imagined.",,,Kindle Edition,,512 pages,"

","#1 New York Times BestsellerIn Furiously Happy, a humor memoir tinged with just enough tragedy and pathos to make it worthwhile, Jenny Lawson examines her own experience with severe depression and a host of other conditions, and explains how it has led her to live life to the fullest:""I've often thought that people with severe depression have developed such a well for experiencing extreme emotion that they might be able to experience extreme joy in a way that ‘normal people' also might never understand. And that's what Furiously Happy is all about.""Jenny’s readings are standing room only, with fans lining up to have Jenny sign their bottles of Xanax or Prozac as often as they are to have her sign their books. Furiously Happy appeals to Jenny's core fan base but also transcends it. There are so many people out there struggling with depression and mental illness, either themselves or someone in their family—and in Furiously Happy they will find a member of their tribe offering up an uplifting message (via a taxidermied roadkill raccoon). Let's Pretend This Never Happened ostensibly was about embracing your own weirdness, but deep down it was about family. Furiously Happy is about depression and mental illness, but deep down it's about joy—and who doesn't want a bit more of that?",,,Kindle Edition,,352 pages,"

Zusammen mit Adson von Melk, seinem etwas tumben, jugendlichen Adlatus, ist er in einer höchst delikaten politischen Mission unterwegs. Doch in den sieben Tagen ihres Aufenthalts werden die beiden mit kriminellen Ereignissen und drastischen Versuchungen konfrontiert: Ein Mönch ist im Schweineblutbottich ertrunken, ein anderer aus dem Fenster gesprungen, ein dritter wird tot im Badehaus gefunden.

","Perfect for fans of suspenseful nonfiction such as books by Steve Sheinkin, this is a page-turning narrative about Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a pastor and pacifist who became an unlikely hero during World War II and took part in a plot to kill Hitler. Written by two-time National Book Award finalist Patricia McCormick, author of Sold and Never Fall Down and coauthor of the young reader’s edition of I Am Malala.It was April 5, 1943, and the Gestapo would arrive any minute. Dietrich Bonhoeffer had been expecting this day for a long time. He had put his papers in order—and left a few notes specifically for Hitler’s men to see. Two SS agents climbed the stairs and told the boyish-looking Bonhoeffer to come with them. He calmly said good-bye to his parents, put his Bible under his arm, and left. Upstairs there was proof, in his own handwriting, that this quiet young minister was part of a conspiracy to kill Adolf Hitler.This compelling, brilliantly researched account includes the remarkable discovery that Bonhoeffer was one of the first people to provide evidence to the Allies that Jews were being deported to death camps. It takes readers from his privileged early childhood to the studies and travel that would introduce him to peace activists around the world—eventually putting this gentle, scholarly pacifist on a deadly course to assassinate one of the most ruthless dictators in history. The Plot to Kill Hitler provides fascinating insights into what makes someone stand up for what’s right when no one else is standing with you. It is a question that every generation must answer again and again.With black-and-white photographs, fascinating sidebars, and thoroughly researched details, this book should be essential reading.",0062411101,9780062411105),ebook,,192 pages,"

","Raised by unconventional Irish Catholics who knew ""how to drink, how to dance, how to talk, and how to stir up the devil,"" Kate Mulgrew grew up with poetry and drama in her bones. But in her mother, a would-be artist burdened by the endless arrival of new babies, young Kate saw the consequences of a dream deferred. Determined to pursue her own no matter the cost, at 18 she left her small Midwestern town for New York, where, studying with the legendary Stella Adler, she learned the lesson that would define her as an actress: ""Use it,"" Adler told her. Whatever disappointment, pain, or anger life throws in your path, channel it into the work.It was a lesson she would need. At twenty-two, just as her career was taking off, she became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter. Having already signed the adoption papers, she was allowed only a fleeting glimpse of her child. As her star continued to rise, her life became increasingly demanding and fulfilling, a whirlwind of passionate love affairs, life-saving friendships, and bone-crunching work. Through it all, Mulgrew remained haunted by the loss of her daughter, until, two decades later, she found the courage to face the past and step into the most challenging role of her life, both on and off screen.We know Kate Mulgrew for the strong women she's played--Captain Janeway on Star Trek; the tough-as-nails ""Red"" on Orange is the New Black. Now, we meet the most inspiring and memorable character of all: herself. By turns irreverent and soulful, laugh-out-loud funny and heart-piercingly sad, BORN WITH TEETH is the breathtaking memoir of a woman who dares to live life to the fullest, on her own terms.

",تولى الإمام «عليُّ بن أبي طالب» الخلافة في ظروف استثنائية؛ حيث كانت الفتنة تعصف ببلاد الإسلام، وقد سال على أرضها دم خليفتها. وكان أمام عليٍّ الكثير من المهام الجسام التي لا تحتمل التأجيل، ومن أخطرها القصاص من قتلة «عثمان»، غير أن الإمام عليًّا كان يرى ضرورة الانتظار ريثما يُحكم سيطرته على الدولة، أما «معاوية بن أبي سفيان» ومن شايعه فأرادوا القصاص السريع. وذلك كان رأس الفتنة التي راح ضحيتها خيرة المسلمين، وتحوَّل بها نظام الحكم من الشورى إلى الوراثة، وظهر الشيعة — أنصار علي بن أبي طالب — والخوارج — معارضوه — كأحزاب سياسية، قبل أن تتخذ مسحة اجتماعية ودينية، لكن النتيجة الأكثر إيلامًا هي أن كثيرًا من النكبات التي تعصف اليوم بالمسلمين تَعُود جذورها إلى تلك الفتنة التي ما زالت جذوتها مُتَّقدة حتى اليوم,9770259306,9770259306,Paperback,,250 pages,"

","An Adventure of the Mind and SpiritThe narrator of this extraordinary tale is a man in search for truth. He answers an ad in a local newspaper from a teacher looking for serious pupils, only to find himself alone in an abandoned office with a full-grown gorilla who is nibbling delicately on a slender branch. ""You are the teacher?"" he asks incredulously. ""I am the teacher,"" the gorilla replies. Ishmael is a creature of immense wisdom and he has a story to tell, one that no other human being has ever heard. It is a story that extends backward and forward over the lifespan of the earth from the birth of time to a future there is still time save. Like all great teachers, Ishmael refuses to make the lesson easy; he demands the final illumination to come from within ourselves. Is it man's destiny to rule the world? Or is it a higher destiny possible for him-- one more wonderful than he has ever imagined?",,,Kindle Edition,,338 pages,"

","In this spellbinding exploration of the varieties of love, the author of the worldwide bestseller Call Me by Your Name revisits its complex and beguiling characters decades after their first meeting.No novel in recent memory has spoken more movingly to contemporary readers about the nature of love than André Aciman’s haunting Call Me by Your Name. First published in 2007, it was hailed as “a love letter, an invocation . . . an exceptionally beautiful book” (Stacey D’Erasmo, The New York Times Book Review). Nearly three quarters of a million copies have been sold, and the book became a much-loved, Academy Award–winning film starring Timothée Chalamet as the young Elio and Armie Hammer as Oliver, the graduate student with whom he falls in love.In Find Me, Aciman shows us Elio’s father, Samuel, on a trip from Florence to Rome to visit Elio, who has become a gifted classical pianist. A chance encounter on the train with a beautiful young woman upends Sami’s plans and changes his life forever.Elio soon moves to Paris, where he, too, has a consequential affair, while Oliver, now a New England college professor with a family, suddenly finds himself contemplating a return trip across the Atlantic.Aciman is a master of sensibility, of the intimate details and the emotional nuances that are the substance of passion. Find Me brings us back inside the magic circle of one of our greatest contemporary romances to ask if, in fact, true love ever dies.",0374155011,9780374155018),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","Com o colapso dos recursos naturais, a humanidade foi obrigada a lutar por sua sobrevivência, e após a Terceira Guerra Mundial e uma reestruturação social, o Reino de Cosmus surgiu em todo o seu esplendor. Com a certeza de que o progresso e o mau uso da tecnologia causaram a destruição do mundo, os governantes de Cosmus proibiram a propagação do conhecimento, abolindo os livros e as escolas. É nesse cenário que se passa a história de “Petrus Logus, o Guardião do Tempo”, lançamento da Editora Saraiva e estreia de Augusto Cury na literatura juvenil. No centro da trama está Petrus, filho do rei Apolo, soberano de Cosmus, um jovem apaixonado pelo conhecimento e sem talento para lutas e embates físicos. Educado pelo sábio Malthus para ser um líder justo e generoso, o príncipe começa a questionar o governo do pai, expondo as injustiças sociais e contestando as posições ditatoriais. Seu senso de justiça o leva a conviver com camponeses, algo proibido para um nobre, e no meio daqueles conhece o verdadeiro amor: a jovem Nátila.Sua atitude contestadora o coloca em situações de risco, já que os conselheiros do rei o vêem como uma ameaça à hegemonia do reino e um rebelde que pode fazer o povo se levantar contra os nobres. E, por questionar uma das decisões tomadas por Apolo, Petrus sofre a maior condenação de Cosmus: é obrigado a vestir a temida Máscara da Humilhação.A máscara deixa fortes cicatrizes físicas e emocionais no jovem príncipe, mas não o enfraquece. Ao contrário. Para continuar sua luta contra as injustiças, Petrus vai precisar domar uma fera, que mal sabe ele, poderá tanto destruí-lo quanto salvá-lo.",,,Hardcover,,296 pages,"

The day before she moved away, she tucked a love letter into his favorite book in his family’s bookshop. She waited. But Henry never came.    Now Rachel has returned to the city—and to the bookshop—to work alongside the boy she’d rather not see, if at all possible, for the rest of her life. But Rachel needs the distraction. Her brother drowned months ago, and she can’t feel anything anymore.    As Henry and Rachel work side by side—surrounded by books, watching love stories unfold, exchanging letters between the pages—they find hope in each other. Because life may be uncontrollable, even unbearable sometimes. But it’s possible that words, and love, and second chances are enough.",,,Kindle Edition,,290 pages,"

","Wilde’s only novel, first published in 1890, is a brilliantly designed puzzle, intended to tease conventional minds with its exploration of the myriad interrelationships between art, life and consequence. From its provocative Preface, challenging the reader to belief in ‘art for art’s sake’, to its sensational conclusion, the story self-consciously experiments with the notion of sin as an element of design. Yet Wilde himself underestimated the consequences of his experiment, and its capacity to outrage the Victorian establishment. Its words returned to haunt him in his court appearances in 1895, and he later recalled the ‘note of doom’ which runs like ‘a purple thread’ through its carefully crafted prose.",1853260150,9781853260155),Paperback,Wordsworth Classics,194 pages,"

","Soon to be a major motion picture—Stephen King’s terrifying, classic #1 New York Times bestseller, “a landmark in American literature” (Chicago Sun-Times)—about seven adults who return to their hometown to confront a nightmare they had first stumbled on as teenagers…an evil without a name: It.Welcome to Derry, Maine. It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real.They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness. But the promise they made twenty-eight years ago calls them reunite in the same place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city’s children. Now, children are being murdered again and their repressed memories of that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster lurking in Derry’s sewers.Readers of Stephen King know that Derry, Maine, is a place with a deep, dark hold on the author. It reappears in many of his books, including Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and 11/22/63. But it all starts with It.“Stephen King’s most mature work” (St. Petersburg Times), “It will overwhelm you… to be read in a well-lit room only” (Los Angeles Times).",1501182099,9781501182099),Hardcover,,1156 pages,"

","Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is a member of Russia's dying aristocracy - a man so lazy that he has given up his job in the Civil Service, neglected his books, insulted his friends and found himself in debt. Too apathetic to do anything about his problems, he lives in a grubby, crumbling apartment, waited on by Zakhar, his equally idle servant. Terrified by the bustle and activity necessary to participate in the real world, Oblomov manages to avoid work, postpone change and - finally - risks losing the love of his life. Written with sympathetic humour and compassion, Oblomov made Goncharov famous throughout Russia on its publication in 1859, as readers saw in this story of a man whose defining characteristic is indolence, the portrait of an entire class in decline.",0140449876,9780140449877),Paperback,,496 pages,"

An anomaly in her friend group, she’s the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she’s bisexual, she hasn’t mustered the courage to tell her friends—not even her openly gay BFF, Simon.So Leah really doesn’t know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. It’s hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting—especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended.",0062643800,9780062643803),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION—The definitive statement of Ayn Rand’s philosophy as interpreted by her best student and chosen heir.  This brilliantly conceived and organized book is Dr. Leonard Peikoff’s classic text on the abstract principles and practical applications of Objectivism, based on his lecture series “The Philosophy of Objectivism.” Ayn Rand said of these lectures: “Until or unless I write a comprehensive treatise on my philosophy, Dr. Peikoff’s course is the only authorized presentation of the entire theoretical structure of Objectivism—that is, the only one that I know of my knowledge to be fully accurate.”   In Objectivism, Peikoff covers every philosophic topic that Rand regarded as important—from certainty to money, from logic to art, from measurement to sex. Drawn from Rand’s published works as well as in-depth conversations between her and Peikoff, these chapters illuminate Objectivism—and its creator—with startling clarity. With Objectivism, the millions of readers who have been transformed by Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead will discover the full philosophical system underlying Ayn Rand’s work.",0452011019,9780452011014),Paperback,,512 pages,"

Futuristic, experimental, and remarkably prophetic, the book traces the adventures of a young Pole whose own fate parallels the collapse of Western civilization following a Chinese communist invasion from the East. Written in 1927, Witkiewicz's novel presages the horrifying anti-utopian society that would become a reality for millions of Eastern Europeans in the late 1930s. Insatiability succeeds in conveying the catastrophic mood of that time - its malaise, its desires, its terrifying glimpse of the future.",0704334836,9780704334830),Paperback,,480 pages,"

In an irreverent vivisection of cultural myths of gender such as ""women are born nurturers"" or ""men are inherently more aggressive,"" Abdou reveals the silent contracts that lie at the underbelly of polished marriages, platonic friendships, barroom flirtations, and not-so-meaningless sex.Abdou's characters have an easy honesty, a dirty-kneed grace that reminds us of girls who climbed trees and pulled the wings off butterflies. Now grown up, they offer biting and insouciant revelations into sexual stereotypes, fear of intimacy, and anger management. Abdou's stories brim with the emotional, moral, and social conundrum of living GAP commercial feminism on a thrift store budget, and provide a deliciously self-effacing joyride through the girl slums of Boystown.",1897235127,9781897235126),Paperback,,182 pages,"

","Before he wrote the bestselling 100 Cupboards trilogy and Ashtown Burials series, N. D. Wilson delighted readers with his first unforgettable action-adventure story of survival. . . .  Thomas Hammond has always lived next to Leepike Ridge, but he never imagined he might end up lost beneath it! The night Tom’s schoolteacher comes to dinner and asks Tom’s mother to marry him, Tom slips out of the house and escapes down a nearby stream on a floating slab of packing foam. The night and stars lull Tom to sleep, and when he wakes, he has ridden his foam raft all the way to the ridge, where the stream dives underground. Flung over rapids and tossed through chasms, Tom finally hits shore, sore but alive. What Tom finds under Leepike Ridge—a dog, a flashlight, a castaway, a tomb, and buried treasure—will answer questions he hadn’t known to ask, and change his life forever. Now, if only he can find his way home again. . . .",0375838732,9780375838736),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","Fever Pitch meets Trainspotting in this laugh-outloud, caustic account of one man’s attempt to coach a peewee soccer team  When Alan Black was a child growing up in Glasgow, Scotland, soccer—or what he called fitba’—was the be all and end all. His experience was not the little league, boys-of-summer stuff of modern America. For him, it was life and death. Now middleaged and living in California, Alan finds himself coaching a team of eight-year-olds in his beloved sport—and nothing is going right. For a start, the kids are no good at soccer. Secondly, they’re pampered. Born and bred on the sport, Black’s hardscrabble Scottish upbringing consisted of playing tough and victory at all costs. Needless to say, his coaching methods are a far cry from the “winning isn’t everything” mentality his little leaguers have been reared with; and players and parents alike are shocked as Black attempts to transform the losing team through drills and bombast. Alone at night, watching evangelicals on TV, Black finds himself searching for some truth in the culture he finds so bizarre. And it’s with the Tigers that he feels most out of sync—faced with a mix of soft suburban children, a raft of overprotective parents, and an Iranian co-coach called Ali. Told with Black’s uproarious Scottish sensibility, Kick the Balls follows the abrasive, irreverent, and hilarious coach as he contends with a team that winds up with a zero-win record. Both a celebration of his own tough childhood and an account of one man’s navigation of an alien culture, Kick the Balls will delight fans of well-told, laugh-out-loud memoirs.",159463047X,9781594630477),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","The shattering crime story that shocked the nation: the Thomas Capano murder case On a June evening in 1996, 30-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, secretary to the governor of Delaware, vanished without a trace following a restaurant rendezvous with her secret lover of more than two years: Thomas Capano. One of Wilmington's most prominent and respected figures, a millionaire attorney and former state prosecutor, ""Tommy"" was a charming, softspoken family man. But in the weeks and months that followed Fahey's disappearance, investigators would gradually uncover the shocking truth: Capano was a steely manipulator driven by power and greed -- and capable of brutal murder. In a riveting narrative expertly documented by probing interviews, diary entries, and e-mail correspondence, and with superb insight into the twisted motivations of a killer, Ann Rule chronicles a real-life drama of Shakespearian proportions: ambitions fall, love turns to obsession, family names are tainted, the façade of success crumbles -- and a beautiful but vulnerable young woman pays the ultimate price in a convoluted and deadly relationship.",0671868713,9780671868710),Paperback,,688 pages,"

","As The Surrounded  opens, Archilde Le�n has just returned from the big city to his father's ranch on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. The story that unfolds captures the intense and varied conflict that already characterized reservation life in 1936, when this remarkable novel was first published.Educated at a federal Indian boarding school, Archilde is torn not only between white and Indian cultures but also between love for his Spanish father and his Indian mother, who in her old age is rejecting white culture and religion to return to the ways of her people. Archilde's young contemporaries, meanwhile, are succumbing to the destructive influence of reservation life, growing increasingly uprooted, dissolute, and hopeless. Although Archilde plans to leave the reservation after a brief visit, his entanglements delay his departure until he faces destruction by the white man's law.In an early review of The Surrounded,  Oliver La Farge praised it as ""simple, clear, direct, devoid of affectations, and fast-moving."" He included it in his ""small list of creditable modern novels using the first Americans as theme."" Several decades later, long out of print but not forgotten, The Surrounded is still considered one of the best works of fiction by or about Native Americans.",0826304699,9780826304698),Paperback,,297 pages,"

","قصص الأنبياء في القرآن الكريم هي قصص لصفوة الخلق وخيرتهم على الإطلاق، فهم هداة العالمين ورحمة الله للناس أجمعين، وما كان الله قص ما قص من قصص في قرآن الكريم للتسلية والتلهي، وإنما جاء عظة وعبرة لأولي الألباب، وجاء يثير في النفس التأمل والتفكر في سنن الحياة وقواعد الاجتماع البشري وسيرة الناس عبر الزمان والمكان. وإن كان ربنا، تبارك وتعالى، أنعم علينا بنعمة قصص طائفة من حكايات الأنبياء وأقوامهم فإنه يلفت النظر إلى أن المهم في تاريخ هؤلاء العظماء أ نقف عند حد العظة والعبرة. ولقد تمثل المفسر الحافظ ابن كثير منهجاً علمياً بديعاً في عرض هذا القصص القرآني، حاول فيه الابتعاد عن خرافات الإسرائيليات وخزعبلات القصاص وأكاذيب بعض المؤرخين.ويمكن تحديد معالم هذا المنهج على النحو التالي: أولاً التزامه بإيراد كل ما يتعلق بالنبي صاحب القصة من كتاب الله تعالى، وأخبار القرآن في هذا السياق هي الأخبار المجزوم يصدقها على وجه اليقين من دون تردد. ولم يكتف المؤلف بذلك بل وقف مع الآيات محللاً لها، مفسراً لمعانيها، متعمقاً في مغازيها، وهو المفسر الواعي بدقائق التفسير.ثانياً عنايته عناية كبيرة بالأخبار والآثار المروية بشأن هؤلاء الأنبياء على عدة مستويات، فالأحاديث يعنى بعزوها إلى مصادرها، منبهاً على صحيحها وسقيمها في كثير من الأحيان، والإسرائيليات إذا وردت في النص، فإنه يرويها في حذر المحدث الواعي بالمرويات، مبيناً الغث منها وما يمكن أن يكون في إطار المقبول، والآثار يتتبع ما يلقي على النص شيئاً من الضوء لإيضاح غامض أو توضيح مبهم. ثالثاً العناية باللغة إلى حد معقول فيفسر ما نبا من مفردات، ويشرح ما ثقل فهمه من نصوص، وهو يحمل في ذهنه عقلية لغوية بليغة. رابعاً بالإضافة إلى ذلك كله التسلسل المنهجي المنطلق مع الأحداث، مع شيء من الاستطراد المقبول بهدف استخراج العظة والوقوف مع فائدة هنا، أو شاردة هناك.وكتاب قصص الأنبياء الذي هو بين يدي القارئ هو جزء من كتاب ابن كثير ""البداية والنهاية""، انتزعه كل طبع الكتاب مستقلاً منه، فليس هو مصنفاً مستقلاً في أصل تأليف ووضعه. ولأهميته تمّ الاعتناء به على هذا النحو: أولاً: العناية بإخراج النص إخراجاً صحيحاً بعيداً عن الأخطاء ما أمكن ذلك، ثانياً: تخريج الآيات القرآنية، مع استعراض غريب المفردات التي توجد في الآيات، ثالثاً: تخريج المرويات المتعددة، رابعاً: شرح المفردات الغريبة في النص كله تيسيراً للفهم وتحقيقاً لهدف تبسيط النص، خامساً: وضع عناوين جانبية لكل فكرة جديدة، ليسهل على القارئ متابعة تسلسل الأحداث والاستفادة بما في الكتاب من فوائد علمية متنوعة.",1591440394,9781591440390),,,,,"['Religion', 'Islam', 'Religion', 'History']"

","In his first novel, A Happy Death, written when he was in his early twenties and retrieved from his private papers following his death in I960, Albert Camus laid the foundation for The Stranger, focusing in both works on an Algerian clerk who kills a man in cold blood. But he also revealed himself to an extent that he never would in his later fiction. For if A Happy Death is the study of a rule-bound being shattering the fetters of his existence, it is also a remarkably candid portrait of its author as a young man.As the novel follows the protagonist, Patrice Mersault, to his victim's house -- and then, fleeing, in a journey that takes him through stages of exile, hedonism, privation, and death -it gives us a glimpse into the imagination of one of the great writers of the twentieth century. For here is the young Camus himself, in love with the sea and sun, enraptured by women yet disdainful of romantic love, and already formulating the philosophy of action and moral responsibility that would make him central to the thought of our time.Translated from the French by Richard Howard",0679764003,9780679764007),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","When Peter Russell finally meets the woman of his dreams he falls as madly in love as you can on a flight from New York to LA. Her name is Holly. She's achingly pretty with strawberry-blonde hair, and reads Thomas Mann for pleasure. She gives Peter her phone number on a page of ""The Magic Mountain,"" but in his room that night Peter finds the page is inexplicably, impossibly, enragingly...gone. So begins the immensely entertaining story of Peter and his unrequited love for his best friend's girl; of Charlotte and her less-than-perfect marriage to a man in love with someone else; of Jonathan and his wicked and fateful debauchery; and of Holly, the impetus for it all. Along the way, there's the evil boss, the desirable temptress, miscommunications, misrepresentations, fiendish behavior, letters gone astray, and ultimately, an ending in which every character gets his due.Both incisive and wonderfully funny, this is a brilliantly understated comedy of manners in which love lost is found again. ""James Collins has written a romantic, funny and insightful page turner about love in modern times, missed opportunities and the wheel of fate (with a blow-out!) that is so engaging and real, you will find it impossible to put down. Peter Russell is an everyman filled with longing, lust and good sense. I promise you will root for him as fate throws him curves aplenty on his path to true love.

India Bridge, the title character, has three children and a meticulous workaholic husband.

","In The Good Life, Jay McInerney unveils a story of love, family, conflicting desires, and catastrophic loss in his most powerfully searing work thus far. Clinging to a semi-precarious existence in TriBeCa, Corrine and Russell Calloway have survived a separation and are wonderstruck by young twins whose provenance is nothing less than miraculous. Several miles uptown and perched near the top of the Upper East Side's social register, Luke McGavock has postponed his accumulation of wealth in an attempt to recover the sense of purpose now lacking in a life that often gives him pause. But on a September morning, brightness falls horribly from the sky, and people worlds apart suddenly find themselves working side by side at the devastated site.Wise, surprising, and, ultimately, heart-stoppingly redemptive, The Good Life captures lives that allow us to see-through personal, social, and moral complexity-more clearly into the heart of things. Ten years on from Brightness Falls, Russell Calloway is still a literary editor although in a diminished capacity; his wife, Corrine, has sacrificed her career to watch anxiously over their children. Across town Luke McGavock, a wealthy ex-investment banker, is taking a sabbatical from making money, struggling to reconnect with his socially resplendent wife, Sasha, and their angst-ridden teenage daughter, Ashley. These two Manhattan families are teetering on the brink of change when 9/11 happens. The Good Life explores through the lens of catastrophe that territory between hope and despair, love and loss, regret and fulfillment. But, ultimately, this is Jay McInerney doing what he does best, presenting us with the life of New York City in all its moral complexity.",0375411402,9780375411403),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Bob Sadino sering dianggap sebagai seorang entrepreneur ikon di Indonesia. Keberhasilannya menjadi pionir di bidang agrobisnis dan agroindustri dengan bendera Kemchicks Group begitu membekas. Pergaulannya yang luas di berbagai kalangan dan kepiawaiannya berkomunikasi pun tak diragukan lagi. Tapi, yang tak kalah menarik adalah gaya Bob dalam berpakaian, berpikir, berkomentar, bersikap, dan bertindak. Inilah komentar publik ; nyentrik, unik, stylish, berkelas, provokatif, kontroversial, berani, sangat merdeka, the real entrepreneur, bahkan fenomenal. Namun, satu kalimat yang mungkin mewakili semua pandangan tersebut, seperti yang Bob sendiri katakan, ""Mereka bilang saya gila !""Buku ini bukan biografi, tetapi sebuah buku provokasi dan lecutan-lecutan agar orang -terutama kaum terpelajar bergelar sarjana- berani menggeser paradigmanya, bahwa teori tanpa praktik itu nonsense atau nothing. Bahwa, gerakan kewiraswastaan adalah pemicu kebangkitan Indonesia.Buku ini juga membeberkan konsep-konsep orisinil Bob tentang dunia entrepreneurship, Roda Bob Sadino, Lingkaran Bob Sadino, revolusi pendidikan, sandaran-sandaran wiraswasta, seni bisnis, dan sebuah diskusi tentang kepemimpinan nasional ideal di mata seorang wiraswasta sejati.",,,,,200 pages,"

We're three mothers from three faiths -- Islam, Christianity, and Judaism -- who got together to write a picture book for our children that would highlight the connections between our religions. But no sooner had we started talking about our beliefs and how to explain them to our children than our differences led to misunderstandings. Our project nearly fell apart.""""After September 11th, Ranya Idliby, an American Muslim of Palestinian descent, faced constant questions about Islam, God, and death from her children, the only Muslims in their classrooms. Inspired by a story about Muhammad, Ranya reached out to two other mothers -- a Christian and a Jew -- to try to understand and answer these questions for her children. After just a few meetings, however, it became clear that the women themselves needed an honest and open environment where they could admit -- and discuss -- their concerns, stereotypes, and misunderstandings about one another. After hours of soul-searching about the issues that divided them, Ranya, Suzanne, and Priscilla grew close enough to discover and explore what united them.""The Faith Club"" is a memoir of spiritual reflections in three voices that will make readers feel as if they are eavesdropping on the authors' private conversations, provocative discussions, and often controversial opinions and conclusions. The authors wrestle with the issues of anti-Semitism, prejudice against Muslims, and preconceptions of Christians at a time when fundamentalists dominate the public face of Christianity. They write beautifully and affectingly of their families, their losses and grief, their fears and hopes for themselves and their loved ones. And as the authors reveal their deepest beliefs, readers watch the blossoming of a profound interfaith friendship and the birth of a new way of relating to others.In a final chapter, they provide detailed advice on how to start a faith club: the questions to ask, the books to read, and most important, the open-minded attitude to maintain in order to come through the experience with an enriched personal faith and understanding of others.Pioneering, timely, and deeply thoughtful, ""The Faith Club""'s caring message will resonate with people of all faiths.For more information or to start your own faith club visit www.thefaithclub.com",074329047X,9780743290470),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

His UK stand-up tour was sold out and his BBC Radio 6 show became a cult phenomenon, the second most popular podcast of the year. Before the fame, however, Russell’s life was anything but glamorous. His father left when he was three months old, he was bulimic at age 12, and began drinking heavily and taking drugs by age 16. He regularly visited prostitutes in Soho, began cutting himself, took drugs on stage during his stand-up shows, and even set himself on fire while on crack cocaine. In 2003 Russell was told that he would be in prison, a mental hospital, or dead within six months unless he went into rehab. He has now been clean for three years, and hasn’t looked back since.

","Julia Ashley was born to a life of dramatic twists and tragedy. Saved from Cromwell’s Irish massacres by her nurse, saved from starvation by a Dutch sea captain… Her future and any possible lasting happiness depended entirely on a ‘glove marriage’ to a man who was no more than a name.  The Dutch East Indies, in the seventeenth century, were lands of legendary riches; of ‘nutmeg princes;’ of fortunes and family empires built on barbaric plantations and slavery. And amid the extravagance, the cruelty, the bizarre customs, perhaps the strangest events of all were the curious weddings that sent girls half-way around the world to husbands they had never seen.  Julia, brave and stoical with a stormy and turbulent history behind her, took her ‘glove’—of yellow, pearl-sewn silk—and began the journey to the island of Rua, to a land of seeming paradise where nothing was exactly as it appeared.",0449229777,9780449229774),Mass Market Paperback,,296 pages,"

","Stuart Ross McCallum shares a true account of his battle with epilepsy-beginning with the peculiar sensations he experienced as a teenager that led to his diagnosis and concluding with his eventual recovery from a temporal lobe lobectomy. McCallum vividly describes his twenty-year journey of living with epilepsy and how this unpredictable disease has not only impacted his life but the lives of everyone around him. For years he operated a business and managed his staff while battling an ever-increasing number of seizures. As his condition worsened and his postseizure responses became more intense, he was often prone to violent outbursts that threatened his safety as well as the safety of those in his inner circle.

","From Library JournalThe former editor of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Colacello has an insider's story to tell. This book is as bitchy and packed with names as its readers could want. The Andy Warhol Factory is described (not surprisingly) as an exploitative place where Andy got richer and richer while his drones worked harder and harder. Colacello's straightforward chronology of working and partying in Warhol's circle is tinged by his bitterness over a heavy workload and little pay at the Factory. His tone captures perfectly the self-obsessed philosophy that drove Warhol, his hangers-on, and the subculture of sex, drugs, parties, discos, and the New York art scene of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Our hero, the Tom Joad-like W. T. Halvorsen, earns the nickname ""Red"" when he becomes a leader of the strike against Daniel Thunner's family company, a strike that draws national attention, and the arrival of professional strikebreaker Pearl Deatherage and of CIO organizer Doris Golden. As the strike spreads in scale and violence, Halvorsen, Thunner and their ideas of honor and morality are put to the test. This is a tough, penetrating, violent novel in the American tradition that goes from Jack London and John Steinbeck to E. L.

","This is the true story of a trip to the beach that never ends. It's about a husband and wife who escape civilization to build a small restaurant on an island paradise -- and discover that even paradise has its pitfalls. It's a story filled with calamities and comedy, culinary disasters and triumphs, and indelible portraits of people who live and work on a sliver of beauty set in the Caribbean Sea. It's about the maddening, exhausting, outlandish complications of trying to live the simple life -- and the joy that comes when you somehow pull it off.The story begins when Bob and Melinda Blanchard sell their successful Vermont food business and decide, perhaps impulsively, to get away from it all. Why not open a beach bar and grill on Anguilla, their favorite Caribbean island? One thing leads to another and the little grill turns into an enchanting restaurant that quickly draws four-star reviews and a celebrity-studded clientele eager for Melinda's delectable cooking. Amid the frenetic pace of the Christmas ""high season,"" the Blanchards and their kitchen staff -- Clinton and Ozzie, the dancing sous-chefs; Shabby, the master lobster-wrangler; Bug, the dish-washing comedian -- come together like a crack drill team. And even in the midst of hilarious pandemonium, there are moments of bliss.As the Blanchards learn to adapt to island time, they become ever more deeply attached to the quirky rhythms and customs of their new home. Until disaster strikes: Hurricane Luis, a category-4 storm with two-hundred-mile-an-hour gusts, devastates Anguilla. Bob and Melinda survey the wreckage of their beloved restaurant and wonder whether leaving Anguilla, with its innumerable challenges, would be any easier than walking out on each other. Affectionate, seductive, and very funny, A Trip to the Beach is a love letter to a place that becomes both home and escape.",060980748X,9780609807484),Paperback,,304 pages,"

When her grandmother teaches her how to use the Evil Eye, telling her it's how Jesus Christ made his miracles and how the Italians got rid of Mussolini, ChiChi realizes it's what her prayers have been missing. Now she can get started on the business of making her mother happier by helping her find love, and healing her brother's weak lungs.But ChiChi's family lives in Minneapolis, and it's the 1950s. For an Italian immigrant family, sometimes it seems like nothing can make life easier. ChiChi's mother still pines for her husband, a long-dead American soldier; ChiChi's brother is disdainful of her sacrifices and penance-he doesn't understand what his older sister already knows, that sometimes God needs to be bribed. When her grandmother passes away, ChiChi steps up her search for meaning and happiness, but it seems to be fruitless. And she struggles, the way so many women do, because her love for her family is suffocating, even while it fulfills her.It's not until she meets two Italian dwarves, and they teach her of the ancient clown tradition, the commedia dell'arte, that she comes to understand that in order to make everyone else happy, she herself must be happy.But first she must find her own way in the world... and learn to accept that not even the power of the Evil Eye can keep people from changing.",0765345889,9780765345882),Mass Market Paperback,,400 pages,"

","In The Rest of Her Life, Laura Moriarty delivers a luminous, compassionate, and provocative look at how mothers and daughters with the best intentions can be blind to the harm they do to one another.Leigh is the mother of high-achieving, popular high school senior Kara. Their relationship is already strained for reasons Leigh does not fully understand when, in a moment of carelessness, Kara makes a mistake that ends in tragedy -- the effects of which not only divide Leigh's family, but polarize the entire community. We see the story from Leigh's perspective, as she grapples with the hard reality of what her daughter has done and the devastating consequences her actions have on the family of another teenage girl in town, all while struggling to protect Kara in the face of rising public outcry.Like the best works of Jane Hamilton, Jodi Picoult, and Alice Sebold, Laura Moriarty's The Rest of Her Life is a novel of complex moral dilemma, filled with nuanced characters and a page-turning plot that makes readers ask themselves, ""What would I do""",1401302718,9781401302719),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","The LaZelle family of southern California has a secret: they can do magic. Real magic. As a teenager, a LaZelle undergoes ""the Transition""--a severe illness that will either kill him or leave him with magical powers. If he's lucky, he gains a talent like shape-changing or wish-granting. If he's unlucky, he never experiences Transition. If he's especially unlucky, he undergoes Transition late, which increases his chances of dying. And if he survives, he will bear the burden of a dark, dangerous magic: the ability to cast only curses. And curse he must, for when a LaZelle doesn't use his magic, it kills him.In Nina Kiriki Hoffman's A Fistful of Sky, Gypsum LaZelle is unique among her brothers and sisters: she has not undergone Transition. She resigns herself to a mundane, magic-bereft existence as a college student.

","The legend of Elizabeth I, the untouchable, charismatic Virgin Queen, is a powerful and enduring one. Most biographies focus on the years of her reign, during which she proved herself as adept a ruler -- and as shrewd an operator -- as England had ever seen. But while the history of her rule is fascinating, the story of how her remarkable character was forged seems vital to a full understanding of the woman who led England into a new age of prosperity, power, and artistic achievement. David Starkey's Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne explores the terra incognita of Elizabeth's early years, and the result is nothing short of captivating.Starkey finds that Elizabeth's early years ran the gamut from days of snug security as the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and Henry's heir apparent, to the years of uncertainty after her mother's execution whenElizabeth was separated from court and virtually forgotten. She received a first-rate academic education, excelling in languages and rhetoric and exhibiting a strong interest in the Protestant religion her father had established in England. But the education she received from life itself would prove far more valuable for the monarch-to-be. After the death of Henry VIII and Edward VI (Elizabeth's half brother), Elizabeth's status as sister and would-be successor to the Catholic queen Mary put her in a dangerous position.It also put her in prison at Mary's command -- and perilously close to execution -- after plots to place Elizabeth on the throne were revealed. Starkey makes it clear that while others may have actually done the dirty work, Elizabeth was usually in the thick of these efforts. Her imprisonment taught her to cover her tracks, but it did not stop her maneuverings. While fervently professing her Catholic faith, she surrounded herself with Protestant advisers and attendants, and bided her time. She evaded another snare of her sister's when Mary attempted to neutralize Elizabeth by marrying her off to a Catholic Spaniard in exchange for naming Elizabeth her successor. Perhaps Elizabeth had learned early on from the plight of her mother that marriage had its drawbacks. Starkey, however, suggests that Elizabeth, in a moment of true regality, would not accept the crown if it came through bullying and capitulation. Again, Elizabeth bided her time.Her seeming patience -- for Starkey reveals that Elizabeth continued to plot -- paid off when Mary, never robust, entered her final illness. Elizabeth managed to convince the now irrational queen that she was, indeed, a staunch Catholic and vowed to preserve England as a Catholic realm. Upon Mary's death, Elizabeth ascended to the throne with no meaningful opposition, thereby beginning what would be a golden age, one of the most legendary reigns in history. Starkey lets us understand, for the first time, the forces that made her into the formidable woman -- and brilliant ruler -- that she would soon prove to be.",0060959517,9780060959517),Paperback,,384 pages,"

Märit, a young woman of British descent, recently orphaned and newly wed, comes to live with her husband, Ben, on their new farm. Despite its Edenic setting, the land explodes in violence and tragedy, and Märit finds herself caught in a tug of war between the local Afrikaner community and the black workers who live on her farm. Frightened, she turns to the only person who can help her, a young woman who is now also alone in the world—her maid, Tembi.

She and her rebellious brother, Hemantha, grow up in Araliya Gardens, a tropical paradise full of orchids, araliyas and mango trees. Their neighbours Bala and Violet are Christian Tamils whose gentle, handsome son Niranjan is Hemantha's best friend. When Priyanthi is older, the two families spend a holiday together by the sea. Priyanthi and Niranjan's eyes are opened up to a strange world outside their protected existence.

Their friendship with him marks their lives indelibly. When Priyanthi and Niranjan return home they have fallen in love. But it is an unthinkable match to both their families, and to a society riven with ethnic divisions. On a hot July day that year the streets of Colombo explode into frenzied violence as mobs begin to hunt and murder Tamils and burn and loot their property.

","For ten years, Hugo Whittier, upper-class scion, former gigolo, failed belle lettriste, has been living a hermit's existence at Waverly, his family's crumbling mansion overlooking the Hudson. He passes the time reading Montaigne and M. F. K. Fisher, cooking himself delicious meals, smoking an endless number of cigarettes, and nursing a grudge against the world. But his older brother, Dennis, has returned, in retreat from an unhappy marriage, and so has his estranged wife, Sonia, and their (she claims) daughter Bellatrix, shattering Hugo's cherished solitude. He's also been told by a doctor that he has the rare Buerger's disease, which means that unless he stops smoking, he will die—all the more reason for Hugo to light up, because his quarrel with life is bitter and an early death is a most attractive prospect. As Hugo smokes and cooks and sexually schemes and pokes his perverse nose into other people's marriages and business, he records these events as well as his mordant, funny, gorgeously articulated personal history and his thoughts on life and mortality in a series of notebooks. His is one of the most perversely compelling literary personalities to inhabit a novel since John Lanchester's The Debt to Pleasure, and his ancestors include the divinely cracked and eloquent narrators of the works of Nabokov. As snobbish and dislikable as Hugo is, his worldview is so seductively conveyed that even the most resistant readers will be put under his spell. His insinuating voice gets into their heads and under their skin in the most seductive way. And as he prepares what may be his final Christmas feast for family and friends, readers will have to ask, ""Isthis the end of Hugo?""Imagine the book the young hero of the independent film hit Igby Goes Down might write twenty-five years from now, and you'll get an idea of the powerfully peculiar charm of The Epicure's Lament.",038572098X,9780385720984),Paperback,,351 pages,"

","In Writing in an Age of Silence, Sara Paretsky explores the traditions of political and literary dissent that have informed her life and work, against the unparalleled repression of free speech and thought in the USA today.In tracing the writer’s difficult journey from silence to speech, Paretsky turns to her childhood youth in rural Kansas, and brilliantly evokes Chicago—the city with which she has become indelibly associated—from her arrival during the civil-rights struggle in the mid-1960s to her most extraordinary literary creation, the south-side detective V I Warshawski. Paretsky traces the emergence of V I Warshawski from the shadows of the loner detectives that stalk the mean streets of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler’s novels, and in the process explores American individualism, the failure of the American dream and the resulting dystopia.Both memoir and meditation, Writing in an Age of Silence is a beautiful, compelling exploration of the writer’s art and daunting responsibility in the face of the assault on US civil liberties post-9/11.",1844671229,9781844671229),Hardcover,,138 pages,"

","One day in early spring, Dorrit Weger is checked into the Second Reserve Bank Unit for biological material. She is promised a nicely furnished apartment inside the Unit, where she will make new friends, enjoy the state of the art recreation facilities, and live the few remaining days of her life in comfort with people who are just like her. Here, women over the age of fifty and men over sixty-single, childless, and without jobs in progressive industries--are sequestered for their final few years; they are considered outsiders.In the Unit they are expected to contribute themselves for drug and psychological testing, and ultimately donate their organs, little by little, until the final donation. Despite the ruthless nature of this practice, the ethos of this near-future society and the Unit is to take care of others, and Dorrit finds herself living under very pleasant conditions: well-housed, well-fed, and well-attended. She is resigned to her fate and discovers her days there to be rather consoling and peaceful.But when she meets a man inside the Unit and falls in love, the extraordinary becomes a reality and life suddenly turns unbearable.

To Odd, it’s not such a big deal. And most folks in sleepy Pico Mundo, California, are much more interested in the irresistible pancakes Odd whips up at the local diner. Still, communing with the dead can be useful. Because while some spirits only want a little company . . . others want justice. When the sad specter of a very frightened boy finds its way to him, Odd vows to root out the evil suddenly infecting the sunny streets of Pico Mundo. But even with his exceptional ability–plus the local police and his pistol-packing girlfriend, Stormy, backing him–is Odd any match for a faceless stalker who’s always a step ahead . . . and determined to kill again?",0345499662,9780345499660),Paperback,,204 pages,"

","Sprawling and intimate, stark and fantastical, Galore is a novel about the power of stories to shape and sustain us.Winner of the Commonwealth Writers’ Prize for Best Book, Caribbean & Canada and the Canadian Authors Association Literary Award; Finalist for the Governor General’s Literary Award for Fiction, the Thomas Head Raddall Atlantic Book Award, and the Winterset Award. When a whale beaches itself on the shore of the remote coastal town of Paradise Deep, the last thing any of the townspeople expect to find inside it is a man, silent and reeking of fish, but remarkably alive. The discovery of this mysterious person, soon christened Judah, sets the town scrambling for answers as its most prominent citizens weigh in on whether he is man or beast, blessing or curse, miracle or demon. Though Judah is a shocking addition, the town of Paradise Deep is already full of unusual characters. King-me Sellers, self-appointed patriarch, has it in for an inscrutable woman known only as Devine’s Widow, with whom he has a decades-old feud. Her granddaughter, Mary Tryphena, is just a child when Judah washes ashore, but finds herself tied to him all her life in ways she never expects. Galore is the story of the saga that develops between these families, full of bitterness and love, spanning two centuries. With Paradise Deep, award-winning novelist Michael Crummey imagines a realm where the line between the everyday and the otherworldly is impossible to discern. Sprawling and intimate, stark and fantastical, Galore is a novel about the power of stories to shape and sustain us.",0385663145,9780385663144),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Prize Poppy Shakespeare is wholly unique -- both an insider's look at the madness of the mental health system and an outsider's discovery of the power of an unlikely friendship, it signals the arrival of an extraordinary new voice on the international literary scene. Who is mad? Who is sane? Who decides? Welcome to the Dorothy Fish, a day hospital in North London. N has been a patient here for thirteen years. Day after day she sits smoking in the common room, swapping medication and comparing MAD money rates. Like all the patients at the Dorothy Fish, N's chief ambition is never to get discharged. Each year, when her annual assessment comes round, she is relieved to learn that she hasn't got any better. Then in walks Poppy Shakespeare in her six-inch skirt and twelve-inch heels. She is certain she isn't mentally ill and desperate to return to her life outside. Though baffled by Poppy's attitude, N agrees to help. Together they plot to gain Poppy's freedom. But in a world where everything's upside-down, are they crazy enough to upset the system? Funny, brilliant, and moving, Poppy Shakespeare looks at madness from the inside, questioning our mental health system and the borders we place between sanity and insanity. Written in high-voltage prose, original and troubling, it is a stunning debut. Excerpt from Poppy Shakespeare: ""'It's not that I've got a problem with mental illness, ' Poppy said. 'It's just there's nothing the matter with me. Do you know what I'm saying?' 'I wouldn't worry bout that, ' I said. 'They must think you's mad or you wouldn't be here. Candid Headphones don't reckon she's mad. Never stopped her, ' I said. . . . 'Poppy?' I said, cause I got to say it. Be like watching a blind man walk under a bus. 'You know what you said bout not thinking you's mad?' 'Yes, ' she said, like what of it? 'Well I wouldn't say nothing to them about that, ' I told her. 'Not at the moment. I mean, don't get me wrong, I ain't saying nothing. It's just the doctors, you never know. They might decide to pick up on it. I mean, it's up to you, do you know what I'm saying, but maybe if you stick to your other symptoms.'""",0385662149,9780385662147),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

So when a stray puppy comes sniffling around the farm, Ricky tells it to get lost. But the puppy keeps trying to play with Ricky. And every time Ricky's Mom feeds the cats, the little dog comes running. The cats aren't sharing their food, however, and the poor pup is slowly starving.

","En estas páginas Primo Levi, Franz Kafka, Evgenia Ginzburg, Milena Jesenska, Dolores Ibárruri o Walter Benjamin mezclan sus tragedias con las de personajes ficticios. Todos ellos comparten un estigma: un día despiertan convertidos en lo que otros cuentan de ellos, en lo que alguien que no les ha conocido cuenta que le han contado, en lo que alguien que les odia imagina que son. Perseguidos por la infamia y arrojados de su casa y de su país, se ven obligados a abandonar sus vidas. Sefarad, nombre que en la tradición hebrea se da a España, designa aquí todos los exilios posibles. El Holocausto y el nazismo, el Gulag, la guerra civil española, el Imperio austrohúngaro, la Inquisición y la expulsión de los judíos articulan a través de cada capítulo una sinfonía en la que la idea coral es una sola: la intolerancia, la persecución y la irracionalidad que asolan la historia de la humanidad, y que dan lugar al título.

Roman de atmosferă şi de „de analiză” a sentimentului, Lorelei este o „contopire de poem şi basm”, în care naraţiunea psihologică de actualitate întîlneşte tradiţia mitologică a romanţului medieval.

","""This woman is a major hero of our time."" —Richard Dawkins Ayaan Hirsi Ali captured the world’s attention with Infidel, her compelling coming-of-age memoir, which spent thirty-one weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Now, in Nomad, Hirsi Ali tells of coming to America to build a new life, an ocean away from the death threats made to her by European Islamists, the strife she witnessed, and the inner conflict she suffered. It is the story of her physical journey to freedom and, more crucially, her emotional journey to freedom—her transition from a tribal mind-set that restricts women’s every thought and action to a life as a free and equal citizen in an open society. Through stories of the challenges she has faced, she shows the difficulty of reconciling the contradictions of Islam with Western values. In these pages Hirsi Ali recounts the many turns her life took after she broke with her family, and how she struggled to throw off restrictive superstitions and misconceptions that initially hobbled her ability to assimilate into Western society. She writes movingly of her reconciliation, on his deathbed, with her devout father, who had disowned her when she renounced Islam after 9/11, as well as with her mother and cousins in Somalia and in Europe. Nomad is a portrait of a family torn apart by the clash of civilizations. But it is also a touching, uplifting, and often funny account of one woman’s discovery of today’s America. While Hirsi Ali loves much of what she encounters, she fears we are repeating the European mistake of underestimating radical Islam. She calls on key institutions of the West—including universities, the feminist movement, and the Christian churches—to enact specific, innovative remedies that would help other Muslim immigrants to overcome the challenges she has experienced and to resist the fatal allure of fundamentalism and terrorism. This is Hirsi Ali’s intellectual coming-of-age, a memoir that conveys her philosophy as well as her experiences, and that also conveys an urgent message and mission—to inform the West of the extent of the threat from Islam, both from outside and from within our open societies. A celebration of free speech and democracy, Nomad is an important contribution to the history of ideas, but above all a rousing call to action.",1439157316,9781439157312),Hardcover,,277 pages,"

","Tradition has painted a portrait of a Savior who stands aloof from governmental concerns and who calls his disciples to an apolitical life. But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, according to John Howard Yoder. This watershed work in New Testament ethics leads us to a Savior who was deeply concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. By canvassing Luke's Gospel, Yoder argues convincingly that the true impact of Jesus' life and ministry on his disciples' social behavior points to a specific kind of Christian pacifism in which ""the cross of Christ is the model of Christian social efficacy."" This second edition of The Politics of Jesus provides up-to-date interaction with recent publications that touch on Yoder's timely topic. Following most of the chapters are new ""epilogues"" summarizing research conducted during the last two decades - research that continues to support the outstanding insights set forth in Yoder's original work.",0802807348,9780802807342),Paperback,2nd Edition,257 pages,"

","Taking the form of dialogues between Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates, these two works are among Plato's final writings. In Timaeus, he gives a thorough account of the world in which we live, describing a cosmos composed of four elements earth, air, fire and water which combine to give existence to all things. An exploration of the origins of the universe, life and humanity, which outlines not just physical laws but also metaphysical and religious principles, it remained a paradigm of science for two thousand years. The mysterious preamble to Timaeus contains the first account in literature of Atlantis, while the fragmentary Critias, unfinished by its author, provides a spellbinding description of the lost continent's ideal society, which Critias asserts was created by the god-like children of Poseidon himself.",0140442618,9780140442618),Paperback,,176 pages,"

A powerfully emotional and beautifully written story of heartbreaking loss and undying love
 He was a fishing guide and struggling artist from a south George trailer park. She was the beautiful only child of South Carolina’s most powerful senator. Yet once Doss Michaels and Abigail Grace Coleman met by accident, they each felt they’d found their true soul mate. Ten years into their marriage, when Abbie faces a life-threatening illness, Doss battles it with her every step of the way. And when she makes a list of ten things she hopes to accomplish before she loses the fight for good, Doss is there, too, supporting her and making everything possible. Together they steal away in the middle of the night to embark upon a 130-mile trip down the St. Mary’s River—a voyage Doss promised Abbie in the early days of their courtship.Where the River Ends chronicles their love-filled, tragedy-tinged journey and a bond that transcends all.",0767926986,9780767926980),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","After three decades of prodigious film work & some unfortunate tabloid adventures, it's easy to forget that Woody Allen began his career as one heck of a great comedy writer. Getting Even, a collection of his late '60s magazine pieces, offers a look into Allen's bag of shtick, back when it was new. From the supposed memoirs of Hitler's barber: ""Then, in January of '45, a plot by several generals to shave Hitler's moustache in his sleep failed when von Stauffenberg, in the darkness of Hitler's bedroom, shaved off one of the Führer's eyebrows instead..."" Even tho the idea of writing jokes about old Adolf--or addled rabbis, or Maatjes herring--isn't nearly as fresh as it used to be, Getting Even still delivers plenty of laughs. At his best, Woody can achieve a level of transcendent craziness that no other writer can match. If you're looking for a book to dip into at random, or a gift for someone who's seen Sleeper 13 times, Getting Even is a classic, with 316,000 copies sold to date.",0394726405,9780394726403),Paperback,First,146 pages,"

","""The Story of the Stone (c. 1760)"", also known by the title of ""The Dream of the Red Chamber"", is the great novel of manners in Chinese literature. Divided into five volumes, of which ""The Warning Voice"" is the third, it charts the glory and decline of the illustrious Jia family (a story which closely accords with the fortunes of the author's own family). The two main characters, Bao-yu and Dai-yu, are set against a rich tapestry of humour, realistic detail and delicate poetry, which accurately reflects the ritualized hurly-burly of Chinese family life. But over and above the novel hangs the constant reminder that there is another plane of existence - a theme which affirms the Buddhist belief in a supernatural scheme of things.",0140443703,9780140443707),Paperback,,640 pages,"

","In The Wives of Bath, Susan Swan penetrates the world of a girls' boarding school and tells a story - at once shocking and wickedly funny - that encompasses rebellion and murder, and stunningly evokes the pain, confusion, and humour of female adolescence and sexual coming-of-age. Internationally acclaimed, Lost and Delirious, is based on the bestselling novel, directed by Lea Pool and starring .It is 1963. Mary Bradford (a.k.a. Mouse) is thirteen when she is shipped off to Bath Ladies College. Mouse, motherless, a hunchback, enters the school feeling very much on its margins, determined never to fit in with the ""normal"" girls, never to succumb to the expectations of the elder role models: the spinster teachers, the elegant mothers of her schoolmates. She chooses her allies carefully: her hump, whom she calls Alice, and John F. Kennedy, to whom she writes long letters asking and giving advice.But the school itself is stranger than Mouse ever could have imagined. A secret underworld of tunnels beneath the buildings, stolen love letters, King Kong worship, and ghostlike apparitions - a world where young girls sometimes refuse to be simply ""good little girls"" - all lead Mouse into experiences, both terrifying and exciting, of an alternate reality for her sex. What begins as experimentation spins out of control, ending in a death that only Mouse can fully comprehend.Susan Swan has created in Mouse Bradford - wise, witty and vulnerable - an unforgettable heroine. The Wives of Bath is a novel that both moves the heart an astonishes the imagination.The internationally acclaimed film adaptation of the novel, Lost and Delirious, was released in 2001. Directed by Lea Pool, starring Piper Perabo, Jessica Paré, and Mischa Barton. Available on DVD and in movie stores.",1862071373,9781862071377),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Get a global perspective on bisexuality from a women's viewpoint!Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective reflects the growing contribution bisexuals, and especially bisexual women, make to queer culture on an international level. This unique book presents a collection of thoughtful essays, studies, and reviews that combine to help develop a language that reflects the reality of bisexuality from a feminine/feminist viewpoint. Authors map the inroads made by bisexual studies into conventional disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, health, literature, film, history, and biography, and analyze the situations of bisexual women in areas as diverse as France, North America, Germany, Australia, and Africa.The rich and varied contributions to Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective track the spread of bisexuality from the urban and metropolitan centers of gay culture to more peripheral areas as the movement becomes more and more hospitable to transnational and transcultural people. The book's main themes--bisexuality's ability to disrupt categories and the resulting feeling of alienation many bisexuals experience--are manifested in approaches that include critical theory, deconstruction, textual analysis, cognitive psychology, personal essay, review essay, reportage, and qualitative study. Topics addressed include:the impact of feminism and women's communities on the appearance of bisexual womenmulti-sexual relationships as border existence in Australiaa South African perspective on bisexualityunderstanding bisexuality's invisibilityLillian Hellmann's bisexual fantasiesand much more!Women and Bisexuality: A Global Perspective follows bisexuality to the crossroads of academics and activism, presenting a wide scope of refreshing and insightful thought that reflects more than an identity or practice.

","THEY'VE WON...They came in the night, to the towns and cities. Like a slow, insidious virus they spread from house to house, building to building, from graveyard to bedroom and cellar to boardroom. They are ancient and deathless, sun-shy and bloodthirsty. For millennia their vile compulsion kept them in the darkest corners of the human imagination. But the dark-hearted hoardes are conquerers now, and those who survive are forced to liveUNDER THE FANGIn this unparalleled feast for the imagination, America's premier horror writers have created a world of vampirism run amok. From Moscow to Tokyo, New York to Los Angeles, vampire kingdoms rise and fall; their unholy religions, fiendish science and depraved entertainments hold ghastly sway.

","The original cast of the famed Swallows and Amazons series is sailing under the stars and the command of Captain Flint in the South China Sea when Gibbet, their pet monkey, grabs the captain’s cigar and drops it in the fuel tank. In minutes, the ship is ablaze (and doomed), and our seven luckless protagonists are adrift in two small boats. They make their way to land, only to find themselves the captives of one of the last remaining pirates operating off the China Coast. But Missee Lee, as it turns out, is no ordinary pirate; her father had sent her off to Cambridge University to prepare her for a life as a teacher. But when her father takes ill and dies, she finds herself struggling to hold together the Three Island Confederation (Tiger, Turtle, and Dragon) he had created, and to be recognized as his legitimate heir and ruler of the Island Kingdom.Ransome is, as always, the consummate storyteller. Here he takes the reader not only on the usual sailing adventures and cliff-hanging escapades, but also into Chinese culture. (It’s no accident that, like so many of Ransome’s protagonists, Missee Lee is a woman, or that her Latin is almost as refined as her sailing skills.) It is also no wonder that The Observer called this, the tenth book in the series, “his best yet . . . a book to buy, to read, and to read again, not once but many times.” The Guardian put it “in a class by itself.” For Ransome, unlike so many writers of his and our generation, was particular in writing about things he knew and had studied first-hand, whether it was a foreign culture, a classical language, a cryptographic code, or the finer points of seamanship.",1567921965,9781567921960),Paperback,,349 pages,"

","On the brink of revolution, with a tide of hate turned against the decadent royal court, France is in turmoil--as is the life of one young woman forced to leave her beloved Paris. After a fire destroys her home and family, Claudette Laurent is struggling to survive in London. But one precious gift remains: her talent for creating exquisite dolls that Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France herself, cherishes. When the Queen requests a meeting, Claudette seizes the opportunity to promote her business, and to return home. . . Amid the violence and unrest, Claudette befriends the Queen, who bears no resemblance to the figurehead rapidly becoming the scapegoat of the Revolution. But when Claudette herself is lured into a web of deadly political intrigue, it becomes clear that friendship with France's most despised woman has grim consequences. Now, overshadowed by the specter of Madame Guillotine, the Queen's dollmaker will face the ultimate test. Infused with the passion and excitement of a country--and an unforgettable heroine--on the threshold of radical change, this captivating novel propels readers into a beguiling world of opulence, adventure, and danger, from the rough streets of eighteenth-century London to France's lavish Palace of Versailles.

","See that car in your rear-view mirror? The driver wants to kill you. Don’t take it personally. You just happen to be in the way. In Scott Cherney’s new novel, Red Asphalt, the operator of the vehicle in question is a troubled medical courier in a triple threat cage match with his two biggest adversaries-everyday life and himself. His marriage to the woman he believed to be his soul mate is rapidly evaporating before his eyes. The book he’s been working on for over a decade is slipping through his fingers as he struggles to complete it. As these pressures grow, he compensates by conjuring up outrageous road rage scenarios in the multiplex of his mind. As his life, job and dreams simultaneously implode, his wild fantasies begin to literally bleed over into reality. Now with a gun in one hand and a steering wheel in the other, this distant runner-up in the human race feels empowered for the very first time. At least our boy’s finally found a purpose in life.",,,Kindle Edition,,298 pages,"

","From award winner Julia Gregson, author of Jasmine Nights, this sweeping international bestseller brilliantly captures the lives of three young women on their way to a new life in India during the 1920s.As the Kaisar-I-Hind weighs anchor for Bombay in the autumn of 1928, its passengers ponder their fate in a distant land. They are part of the “Fishing Fleet”—the name given to the legions of English women who sail to India each year in search of husbands, heedless of the life that awaits them. The inexperienced chaperone Viva Holloway has been entrusted to watch over three unsettling charges. There’s Rose, as beautiful as she is naïve, who plans to marry a cavalry officer she has met a mere handful of times. Her bridesmaid, Victoria, is hell-bent on losing her virginity en route before finding a husband of her own. And shadowing them all is the malevolent presence of a disturbed schoolboy named Guy Glover. From the parties of the wealthy Bombay socialites to the poverty of Tamarind Street, from the sooty streets of London to the genteel conversation of the Bombay Yacht Club, East of the Sun takes us back to a world we hardly understand but yearn to know.

The most famous poet of the Jazz Age, Millay captivated the nation: She smoked in public, took many lovers (men and women, single and married), flouted convention sensationally, and became the embodiment of the New Woman.Thirty years after her landmark biography of Zelda Fitzgerald, Nancy Milford returns with an iconic portrait of this passionate, fearless woman who obsessed America even as she tormented herself. Chosen by USA Today as one of the top ten books of the year, Savage Beauty is a triumph in the art of biography.

"," The Walter Mosley and his new hero, Leonid McGill, are back in the new New York Times-bestselling mystery series that's already being hailed as a classic of contemporary noir.   Leonid McGill-the protagonist introduced in The Long Fall, the book that returned Walter Mosley to bestseller lists nationwide -is still fighting to stick to his reformed ways while the world around him pulls him in every other direction. He has split up with his girlfriend, Aura, because his new self won't let him leave his wife-but then Aura's new boyfriend starts angling to get Leonid kicked out of his prime, top-of-the­skyscraper office space. Meanwhile, one of his sons seems to have found true love-but the girl has a shady past that's all of sudden threatening the whole McGill family-and his other son, the charming rogue Twilliam, is doing nothing but enabling the crisis.  Most ominously of all, Alfonse Rinaldo, the mysterious power-behind- the-throne at City Hall, the fixer who seems to control every little thing that happens in New York City, has a problem that even he can't fix- and he's come to Leonid for help. It seems a young woman has disappeared, leaving murder in her wake, and it means everything to Rinaldo to track her down. But he won't tell McGill his motives, which doesn't quite square with the new company policy- but turning down Rinaldo is almost impossible to even contemplate.  Known to Evil delivers on all the promise of the characters and story lines introduced in The Long Fall, and then some. It careens fast and deep into gritty, glittery contemporary Manhattan, making the city pulse in a whole new way, and it firmly establishes Leonid McGill as one of the mystery world's most iconic, charismatic leading men.

Here, in his own words, are the fascinating first thirty years in the life of one of the most provocative and compelling leaders of the twentieth century, Winston Churchill.
As a visionary, statesman, and historian, and the most eloquent spokesman against Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill was one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century. In this autobiography, Churchill recalls his childhood, his schooling, his years as a war correspondent in South Africa during the Boer War, and his first forays into politics as a member of Parliament. My Early Life not only gives readers insights into the shaping of a great leader but, as Churchill himself wrote, ""a picture of a vanished age.""If you want to fully understand Winston Churchill, My Early Life is essential reading.",0684823454,9780684823454),Paperback,,396 pages,"

Szczególnie, gdy dookoła czają się groźne demony i „życzliwi” doradcy czekający jakby tu przejąć władzę.Salianka miała cechy prawdziwej królewny, w tym przede wszystkim próżność, oraz cechę prawdziwej czarownicy – umiała wykorzystywać magię by, osiągnąć swój cel. Jednak najważniejszą cechą Salianki, która ją zdecydowanie wyróżniała wśród innych, były wrota, które zadomowiły się w jej umyśle i stanowiły prawdziwą bramę do piekieł. Otwierały się tylko na „specjalne” okazje by uwięzić wszelkie pomioty zła. Królewna, mając tak ogromny potencjał złych mocy, siała prawdziwy postrach i nic dziwnego, że świadoma swojej władzy zaczęła podbijać sąsiednie krainy. Był jednak pewien mankament. Wrota potrafiły działać bez zgody swojej pani, przejmując niekiedy całkowicie władzę nad jej umysłem i ciałem. Stąd był już tylko krok do opętania, a łatwo się domyślić, co może się stać z krainą rządzoną przez opętaną czarownicę.Powieść Mileny Wójtowicz nosi wszelkie znamiona bajki. Ale jest to wyjątkowo przewrotna bajka. Królewna wcale nie jest piękna, jej największym zagrożeniem nie są obcy wojownicy, lecz egzorcyści, i nawet żaba podająca się za księcia tak naprawdę jest tylko zaczarowanym pastuchem.

Because of his infamous birth (and famous parentage), Jordan Jennings' every move made the headlines, and he soon learned that the only way to keep the media out of his life was not to have a life at all. Charged with keeping his family's secrets, as well as his own, he put aside his own desires for the sake of family pride. With the chance of love on the horizon, will Jordan have to sacrifice his family's reputation in order to have a life of his own? Patrick Wright was a fearless reporter headed straight to the top. He was a man who knew what he wanted and always went after it. With money, success, and a very healthy social life, Patrick had no idea that anything was missing until he met Jordan, someone he suddenly couldn’t do without. But when careers hang in the balance and Patrick is faced with losing everything he's worked so hard to achieve, will his love for Jordan conquer all?",,,Paperback,,181 pages,"

He’s determined to find out what really happens in there. If the only way he can do that is to volunteer to be thrown to the lions himself, so be it. Kefir’s never worked out what the other lions find so interesting about the human sacrifices who visit their den, but this new man is unlike any other human he’s ever met, and Kefir’s captivated. Can the smallest lion in the pride claim a man like Ellery as his pet—is that even the way Kefir wants to think of his human mate?This book is best read in sequence as part of a series.

","One of the most popular and controversial historians of the twentieth century, who made his subject accessible to millions, A.J.P. Taylor caused a storm of outrage with this scandalous bestseller. Debunking what were accepted truths about the Second World War, he argued provocatively that Hitler did not set out to cause the war as part of an evil master plan, but blundered into it partly by accident, aided by the shortcomings of others. Fiercely attacked for vindicating Hitler, A.J.P. Taylor's stringent re-examination of the events preceding the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1st September 1939 opened up new debate, and is now recognized as a brilliant and classic piece of scholarly research.

","More than a decade after the end of the cold war has chilled the Marxist rebel movements around the world, one hot spot remains--Colombia. Why a democratic country with a growing economy should still feel the brushfires of a civil war is a mystery to U.S. analysts, but not to certain parties on the other side of the world. The inexplicable loss of three major U.S. assets draws the attention of the world to the Colombian demilitarized zone. Are the local Colombian rebels responsible? Or is a deadly Middle Eastern secret cloaked by the jungle canopy of the DMZ? Among the contingent of politicians and media headed for the DMZ seeking answers is reporter Julie Baker, whose parents had been missionaries in Colombia. Old hurts and terrors surge as she revisits the place of her birth--and her parents' deaths. When Julie's own abduction by guerrillas triggers a time bomb that has been ticking under the feet of the U.S. for a decade, she is left with more questions than answers. With the fate of two countries resting in her hands, Julie must put aside her own terror to face just what God's call to sacrifice will mean for her past and her increasingly uncertain future.

What would he think of human progress since his day? How would he react to our values? To our culture? And what would he think of Jesus? Peter Kreeft, Christian philosopher and longtime admirer of the historic Socrates, imagines the result. In this drama Socrates meets such fellow students as Bertha Broadmind, Thomas Keptic and Molly Mooney. Throughout, Kreeft weaves an intriguing web as he brings Socrates closer and closer to a meeting with Jesus. Here is a startling and provocative portrayal of reason in search of truth. In a new introduction to this revised edition, Kreeft also highlights the inspiration for this book and the key questions of truth and faith it addresses.",0830823387,9780830823383),Paperback,,182 pages,"

Exuberant and fearless, Heller explores the technique and science of surfing the secrets of its culture, and the environmental ravages to the stunning coastline he visits.As Heller plumbs the working of his own heart and finds joy in both love and surfing, he affords readers vivid insight into this fascinating world, with all of its perils and pleasures, its absurdity and wonder. Exhilarating, entertaining, and moving, Kook is a love story between a man and his surfboard, a man and his girlfriend, a not-so-old man and the sea.",1439171815,9781439171813),ebook,,336 pages,"

","It is a spring morning in New Orleans, 1843. In the Spanish Quarter, on a street lined with flophouses and gambling dens, Madame Carl recognizes a face from her past. It is the face of a German girl, Sally Miller, who disappeared twenty-five years earlier. But the young woman is property, the slave of a nearby cabaret owner. She has no memory of a ""white"" past. Yet her resemblance to her mother is striking, and she bears two telltale birthmarks. In brilliant novelistic detail, award-winning historian John Bailey reconstructs the exotic sights, sounds, and smells of mid-nineteenth-century New Orleans, as well as the incredible twists and turns of Sally Miller's celebrated and sensational case. Did Miller, as her relatives sought to prove, arrive from Germany under perilous circumstances as an indentured servant or was she, as her master claimed, part African, and a slave for life? A tour de force of investigative history that reads like a suspense novel, The Lost German Slave Girl is a fascinating exploration of slavery and its laws, a brilliant reconstruction of mid-nineteenth-century New Orleans, and a riveting courtroom drama. It is also an unforgettable portrait of a young woman in pursuit of freedom.",080214229X,9780802142290),Paperback,,268 pages,"

","A Booke of Days is the captivating story of a young French nobleman, Roger, Duke of Lunel, who leaves his home in Provence in the 11th century to join the forces that will attempt to recapture Jerusalem from its Turkish occupiers. Forced to leave his new wife by the sacred commitment of an armed pilgrimage, he is plagued by guilt over a secret sin from his past and his own religious doubt that arises during his mission. The holy crusade on which Roger embarks soon degenerates into a savage campaign dogged by betrayal, deceit and greed. Yet this was the greatest adventure of its time, where a hundred thousand medieval men who had previously never traveled much beyond their own villages undertook a journey halfway across the known world for the promise of salvation. Most would never see their homelands again. And for Roger, this greatest of all spiritual undertakings is an intensely human quest: a war of new and old ideas, a collision of cultures, an awakening prompted as much by slaughter as sanctity, a battle of the flesh as well as the spirit.",9728461003,5603966110032),"Capa mole - 15,5 x 23 x 2cm",,361 pages,"

This new edition has been revised throughout to make it more accessible to the general reader, and features a new introduction, a new epilogue, and three new chapters. While Korten points out that the multinationals are, if anything, more powerful now than they were when he first wrote the book, he also offers reason for hope: the growth of the international Living Democracy movement opposing corporate rule. The new material in the book:  Documents the consolidation since1995 of financial and corporate power at the expense of democracy, people, communities, and the planet  Looks in depth at the nature and cultural underpinnings of the burgeoning Living Democracy movement to resist corporate power  Offers a vision of a what a civil society grounded in life-centered values rather than immediate financial gain might look like.

Her new boss is Vivian Grant, a notoriously ruthless tyrant known for her tirades, traumatized assistants, and tabloid-inspired bestsellers. Soon Claire's job is stealing more and more of her time and her relationship with her fiance begins to feel the strain. It doesn't help that she's working late nights with a brilliant-and handsome-first-time author.

Le quatrième roman de Maupassant (1850-1893), publié en 1888, est sans doute le meilleur. Le récit, qui tient à la fois de l'étude naturaliste et de l'analyse psychologique, s'appuie sur une intrigue, simple et forte.

After a week the local police investigating the case haven't even identified her, let alone gotten to the bottom of how she died. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Chief Superintendent Michele Ferrara, head of Florence's elite Squadra Mobile, decides to step in. Because toxins were discovered in the girl's body, many assumed that she died of a self-inflicted drugs overdose, but Ferrara quickly realizes that the truth is darker than that: he believes that the girl was murdered. When he delves deeper, there are many aspects to the case that convince Ferrara that the girl's death is part of a sinister conspiracy—a conspiracy that has its roots in the very foundations of Tuscan society.",0349120072,9780349120072),Paperback,,381 pages,"

","Francesca Lia Block has charmed and amazed young audiences with tales of the mystical and ethereal. This outstanding story is no different. Following the life of Echo, an L.A. baby born to an artistic dad and a mom who's an angel, this enthralling story offers more than fairy dust and the supernatural. It tells the tale of a girl who feels doomed to be less than angelic, at least in comparison with her mother. Mom's startling beauty and aura enchant all who meet her, and Echo can never keep up. Desperate to be loved as much, and maybe find her own identity, she escapes to the boys in her life. Ultimately, she must rely on herself for the strength to survive.Simple text ands story lines do not appeal to Block, who weaves a tale with amazing grace and the flowing energy of a true genius. Images of vampires, ghosts, and fairies fill these pages, daring the reader to believe. Told from the point of view of Echo and the key players in her life, the story imparts a dreamlike quality to Echo's life. This a novel layered with pain beauty, and triumph, all which will appeal to young readers.",0064407446,9780064407441),Paperback,,215 pages,"

","A clearheaded study of what life can do to us and possible ways to begin again. --Carl A. Whitaker, M.D., author of Midnight Musings of a Family Therapist and coauthor of The Family Crucible Women and men who have been deeply hurt by someone they love often experience a pain that spirals out to undermine their work, relationships, self-esteem, and even their sense of reality. In Forgiving the Unforgivable, author Beverly Flanigan, a leading authority on forgiveness, defines such unforgivable injuries, explains their poisonous effects, and then guides readers out of the paralyzing anger and resentment. As a Fellow of the Kellogg Foundation, Flanigan conducted a pioneering study of forgiveness, and from that study, from her clinical practice, and from her many years of teaching, researching, and conducting professional workshops and seminars, she devised a unique six-stage program, presented here. Filled with inspiring real-life examples, Forgiving the Unforgivable is both a practical and a comforting guide to recovery and healing.",0020322305,9780020322306),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","""Do I remember that first sight of him clearly now, after all that has been? I should have been struck speechless. I should have swooned. Instead, I walked toward him quite calmly, or I thought I was calm. Yet I do remember wondering if I had combed my hair that morning. I do remember being glad I had worn a bra and wishing it were not so plain and businesslike. And I remember thinking of one more thing to add to my 'before I die' list - not the list I'd written out of things a person can actually arrange on purpose, but the mental list of things I would most likely die without: passion. It is a measure of how dazzled I was that I completely failed to see any significance in such a thought at that particular moment."" And so begins The Falconer, a stunning love story set in the Sierra Nevada mountains, about two ordinary people whose lives are transformed by love. India Blake realizes that she has let her life pass in dutiful commitments, without living fully, without achieving her dream of adventure and love. And then she meets Rhodri, a master falconer who teaches her how to fly falcons - and with whom she discovers the passion and deep connection she has been missing.",0787109428,9780787109424),Audio Cassette,,0 pages,"

","The newest novel in the New York Times bestselling series that inspired Showtime's #1 hit, Dexter. Jeff Lindsay now delivers his most macabre, witty, and purely entertaining new adventure for America's dark defender.Dexter Morgan's happy homicidal life is undergoing some major changes. He's always live by a single golden rule - he kills only people who deserve it. But the Miami blood-spatter analyst has recently become a daddy - to an eight-pound curiosity named Lily Anne - and strangely, Dex's dark urges seem to have left him. Is he ready to become an overprotective father? To pick up soft teddy bears instead of his trusty knife, duct tape, and fishing wire? What's a serial killer to do?Then Dexter is summoned to investigate the disappearance of an eighteen-year-old girl who seems to have been abducted by a bizarre group...who just may be vampires...and - possibly - cannibals. Nothing like the familiar hum of his day job to get Dexter's creative dark juices flowing again. Assisting his bull-in-a-china-shop detective sister, Deborah, Dex wades into an investigation that gets more disturbing by the moment. And to compound the complication of Dexter's ever-more-complicated life, a person from his past suddenly reappears...moving dangerously close to his home turf and threatening to destroy the one thing tat has maintained Dexter's pretend human cover and kept him out of the electric chair: his new family.From an uncharacteristically racy encounter in the Florida Everglades to the most bizarre fringe nightclub in the anything-goes Miami scene, Dexter Is Delicious is an ingenious journey through the dark recesses of Dexter's lovably cold soul. Jeff Lindsay is once again at the top of his game, with this new novel that will thrill fans of his bestselling series.",0385532350,9780385532358),Hardcover,1st Edition,350 pages,"

","In the speech he gave upon accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957, Albert Camus said that a writer ""cannot serve today those who make history; he must serve those who are subject to it."" And in these twenty-three political essays, he demonstrates his commitment to history's victims, from the fallen maquis of the French Resistance to the casualties of the Cold War. Resistance, Rebellion and Death displays Camus's rigorous moral intelligence addressing issues that range from colonial warfare in Algeria to the social cancer of capital punishment. But this stirring book is above all a reflection on the problem of freedom, and, as such, belongs in the same tradition as the works that gave Camus his reputation as the conscience of our century: The Stranger, The Rebel and The Myth of Sisyphus.",0679764011,9780679764014),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Salvador Dalì’s (1904–89) surrealist paintings such as The Persistence of Memory and The Metamorphosis of Narcissus are internationally beloved for their unforgettable images and eccentric metaphors for the human condition. His lesser-known but equally intriguing writings, on the other hand, are remarkably coarse, describing human bodies and evocations of sexuality with a bewildering mixture of crude realism and naïve simplicity.Dalì and Me is an account by art historian and controversial author Catherine Millet of a highly personal encounter with the artist’s celebrated paintings and self-reflective writings. One of the first studies of the notoriously idiosyncratic artist’s essays, this revolutionary book reveals all the narcissism, anxiety, and visual genius of the most famous—and infamous—of the surrealists. Based on years of scrupulous research into Dalì’s life and art yet deeply enriched by Millet’s autobiographical journey, this landmark volume uncovers the reverberations of Dalì’s influence on his friends and contemporaries. In its explorations of both Millet’s and Dalì’s inner workings, Dalì and Me ultimately becomes an argument in book form that personal involvement can be the key to understanding one of the most compelling oeuvres in art history.  ",3858817112,9783858817112),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

But when Jack suffers a near fatal accident, his life is forever changed. His father sends him to a mysterious doctor in New York City, a place Jack hasn't been since his mother died there eight years ago. While in the city, Jack meets Euri, a young girl who offers to show him the secrets of Grand Central Station. Here, Jack discovers New York's Underworld, a place where those who died in New York reside until they are ready to move on. This, Jack believes, is a chance to see his mother again. But as secrets about Euri's past are revealed, so are the true reasons for Jack's visit to the Underworld.  Masterfully told, The Night Tourist weaves together New York City's secret history and its modern-day landscape to create a highly vivid ghost world, full of magical adventure and page-turning action.

The comedy is what makes the tragedy bearable, what prevents us, as readers, from finally turning away from the irreversibility of death and the disappointments of love. The narrator of Love Warps the Mind a Little, 36-year-old Lafayette Proulx, a struggling writer, has just wrecked his marriage of 14 years and moved in with his lover, Judi Dubey, who is not overjoyed to see him. Then, when Judi is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, Laf finds himself in the role of caregiver, witnessing the stealthy approach of death and learning about the sacrifices and duties of love that offer a surprising amount of redemption.

","On the Rez is a sharp, unflinching account of the modern-day American Indian experience, especially that of the Oglala Sioux, who now live on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in the plains and badlands of the American West. Crazy Horse, perhaps the greatest Indian war leader of the 1800s, and Black Elk, the holy man whose teachings achieved worldwide renown, were Oglala; in these typically perceptive pages, Frazier seeks out their descendants on Pine Ridge--a/k/a ""the rez""--which is one of the poorest places in America today.Along with his longtime friend Le War Lance (whom he first wrote about in his 1989 bestseller, Great Plains) and other Oglala companions, Frazier fully explores the rez as they visit friends and relatives, go to pow-wows and rodeos and package stores, and tinker with a variety of falling-apart cars. He takes us inside the world of the Sioux as few writers ever have, writing with much wit, compassion, and imagination. In the career of SuAnne Big Crow, for example, the most admired Oglala basketball player of all time, who died in a car accident in 1992, Frazier finds a contemporary reemergence of the death-defying, public-spirited Sioux hero who fights with grace and glory to save her followers.On the Rez vividly portrays the survival, through toughness and humor, of a great people whose culture has helped to shape the American identity.",0312278594,9780312278595),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Buku tentang semiotika ini dimulai dari sebuah definisi semiotika yang dikemukakan oleh Umberto Eco yang mengatakan, bahwa semiotika ""... pada prinsipnya adalah sebuah disiplin yang mempelajari segala sesuatu yang dapat digunakan untuk berdusta (lie)."" Definis Eco ini ꟷmeskipun mungkin sangat mencengangkan banyak orangꟷsecara eksplisit menjelaskan betapa sentralnya konsep dusta di dalam wacana semiotika, sehingga dusta tampaknya menjadi prinsip utama semiotika itu sendiri. Kenapa? Karena, semiotika sebagai satu bentuk representasi pada dasarnya adalah sesuatu yang hadir namun menunjukkan bahwa sesuatu di luar dirinya sendirilah yang coba dia hadirkan. Representasi tidak menunjuk kepada dirinya sendiri, namun kepada orang lain. Karena sifat dasar itulah, maka representasi sering dipermasalahkan ihwal kemampuannya untuk bisa menghadikan ""sesuatu"" di luar dirinya, karena seringkali representasi malah beralih menjadi ""sesuatu"" itu sendiri. Jurang yang terbentuk antara representasi dan yang direpresentasikan ini seringkali terlupakan oleh manusia. Nah, permasalahan ""tipuan"" seperti inilah yang menjadi landasan pembahasan tentang [hiper]semiotika dalam buku. Inilah buku yang menjadi rujukan wajib bagi para pemerhati semiotika dan cultural studies.Buku ini sebagai buku utuh, berhasil memperlhatkan secara menyeluruh dan rinci ... [disertai]...

","Emily Starr was born with the desire to write. As an orphan living on New Moon Farm, writing helped her face the difficult, lonely times. But now all her friends are going away to high school in nearby Shrewsbury, and her old-fashioned, tyrannical aunt Elizabeth will only let her go if she promises to stop writing! All the same, this is the first step in Emily's climb to success. Once in town, Emily's activities set the Shrewsbury gossips buzzing. But Emily and her friends are confident -- Ilse's a born actress, Teddy's set to be a great artist, and roguish Perry has the makings of a brilliant lawyer. When Emily has her poems published and writes for the town newspaper, success seems to be on its way -- and with it the first whispers of romance. Then Emily is offered a fabulous opportunity, and she must decide if she wants to change her life forever.",0553262149,9780553262148),Paperback,,325 pages,"

","Nineteen-year-old Harold Chasen is obsessed with death. He fakes suicides to shock his self-obsessed mother, drives a customized Jaguar hearse, and attends funerals of complete strangers. Seventy-nine-year-old Maude Chardin, on the other hand, adores life. She liberates trees from city sidewalks and transplants them to the forest, paints smiles on the faces of church statues, and “borrows” cars to remind their owners that life is fleeting—here today, gone tomorrow! A chance meeting between the two turns into a madcap, whirlwind romance, and Harold learns that life is worth living. Harold and Maude started as Colin Higgins’ master’s thesis at UCLA Film School, and the script was purchased by Paramount. The film, directed by Hal Ashby, was released in 1971 and it bombed. But soon this quirky, dark comedy began being shown on college campuses and at midnight-movie theaters, and it gained a loyal cult following. This novelization was written by Higgins and published shortly after the film’s release but has been out of print for more than 30 years. Even fans who have seen the movie dozens of times will find this companion valuable, as it gives fresh elements to watch for and answers many of the film’s unresolved questions.",0380003856,9780380003853),Paperback,,150 pages,"

","Everyone should know the life story of Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest leaders of all time, the first black president of South Africa, the most famous African, and a major world statesman. His inspiring life receives a fresh retelling in this new biography written especially for students and general readers. This volume is an enjoyable, authoritative, and balanced way to not only understand a great man, but also to understand a critical time in world history and race relations. Mandela's quest for racial justice for black South Africans as a leader of the African National Congress led to twenty-seven years of imprisonment. South African Apartheid consumed the attention of the world, coming to a head in the 1980s. With intense international pressure on the Apartheid government, Mandela was finally freed in 1990. Through the landmark presidency of South Africa and post Nobel Peace Prize years up until today, he has continued as a peacemaker and agent for change.Chapter 1 covers his birth into a strong Xhosa family and clan, with cultural, historical, and geographical context, and the next chapter follows his elite education path, taking into consideration the forces and people who helped shape the future leader. Chapter 3 discusses his law practice, African National Congress work, and his first wife. Chapters 4-6 continue with his growing political involvement and family. Chapter 7 and 8 deal with the long imprisonment and then freedom. The final chapters discuss his presidency and Nobel Peace Prize and life today. A timeline, photo essay, and selected bibliography complement the narrative.",0313340358,9780313340352),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

He was abandoned and forced to bounce from foster family to foster family while the drug dealer responsible for her death went free. That same drug dealer also went by a different name: dad. Broke and hungry, Seven somehow manages to track his dad to St. Louis where revenge becomes even more difficult. There he comes face to face with death, drug lords and overzealous cops, but after all that his biggest challenge may be himself. Influenced by the good-hearted Southern belle that he loves and the scrappy hellion that he wants to hate, Seven must decide not only how he wants to punish the man that ruined his life, but who he wants to be.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

Michael HingsonFirst came the boom the loud, deep, unapologetic bellow that seemed to erupt from the very core of the earth. Eerily, the majestic high-rise slowly leaned to the south. On the seventy-eighth floor of the World Trade Center's north tower, no alarms sounded, and no one had information about what had happened at 8:46 a.m. on September 11, 2001. What should have been a normal workday for thousands of people. All that was known to the people inside was what they could see out the windows: smoke and fire and millions of pieces of burning paper and other debris falling through the air.Blind since birth, Michael couldn't see a thing, but he could hear the sounds of shattering glass, falling debris, and terrified people flooding around him and his guide dog, Roselle. However, Roselle sat calmly beside him. In that moment, Michael chose to trust Roselle's judgment and not to panic. They are a team.Thunder Dog allows you entry into the isolated, fume-filled chamber of stairwell B to experience survival through the eyes of a blind man and his beloved guide dog. Live each moment from the second a Boeing 767 hits the north tower, to the harrowing stairwell escape, to dodging death a second time as both towers fold into the earth.It's the 9/11 story that will forever change your spirit and your perspective. Thunder Dog illuminates Hingson's lifelong determination to achieve parity in a sighted world, and how the rare trust between a man and his guide dog can inspire an unshakable faith in each one of us.",140020304X,9781400203048),Hardcover,,231 pages,"

Once there, he encounters a horror of violence and gore he could not have imagined and sustains his spirit with only the words on the pages from home and the camaraderie of the mud-covered Irish boys who fight and die by his side.  Dimly aware of the political tensions that have grown in Ireland in his absence, Willie returns on leave to find a world split and ravaged by forces closer to home. Despite the comfort he finds with his family, he knows he must rejoin his regiment and fight until the end. With grace and power, Sebastian Barry vividly renders Willie’s personal struggle as well as the overwhelming consequences of war.",0143035096,9780143035091),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Wars may end. But vengeance is forever.  Roudette's story was a simple one. A red cape. A wolf. A hunter. Her mother told her she would be safe, so long as she kept to the path. But sometimes the path leads to dark places. Roudette is the hunter now, an assassin known throughout the world as the Lady of the Red Hood. Her mission will take her to the country of Arathea and an ancient fairy threat. At the heart of the conflict between humans and fairies stands the woman Roudette has been hired to kill, the only human ever to have fought the Lady of the Red Hood and survived-the princess known as Sleeping Beauty.",0756406080,9780756406080),Mass Market Paperback,,337 pages,"

","Boy and Going Solo is the whole of Roald Dahl's extraordinary autobiography in one volume. Reissued in the exciting new Roald Dahl branding. Boy is the story of Roald Dahl's very own boyhood, including tales of sweet-shops and chocolate, mean old ladies and a Great Mouse Plot - the inspiration for some of his most marvellous storybooks in the years to come. Going Solo tells of how, when he grew up, Roald Dahl left England for Africa and later went flying with the Royal Air Force, before he became the world's number-one storyteller. You can listen to all of Roald Dahl's stories on Puffin Audiobooks, read by some very famous voices, including Kate Winslet, David Walliams and Steven Fry - plus there are added squelchy soundeffects from Pinewood Studios!

He is called back to the world of the living by an unexpected, and unwelcome, visit from Harry Brofsky, his former boss. Brofsky wants Ben to do some background work (strictly off the record) with another reporter on the investigation of a seemingly motiveless killing outside a local gay bar.Sucked in for reasons even he doesn't quite understand, Justice finds himself back in the life of gay bars, spurned lovers, dysfunctional families, and tawdry secrets--all the things he had been trying to escape. While fending off passes from his sexy, young female partner, he finds himself falling hopelessly in love with the man he must ultimately nail for murder--a killing that turns out to have far more personal and political implications than a simple bias crime.Simple Justice is a subtly plotted mystery that takes a piercing look at not only violent crime but violations of the heart and soul in the sometimes glamorous, more often dark and dangerous gay life of West Hollywood.",0553575325,9780553575323),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Birkenhead, 1973. The eighteen-year-old Paul O'Grady gets ready for a big Saturday night out on the town. New white T-shirt, freshly ironed jeans, looking good. As he bids farewell to his mum, who's on the phone to his auntie, and wanders off down the street in a cloud of aftershave, he hears her familiar cry: 'Oh, the devil rides out tonight, Annie. The Devil rides out!'The further adventures of Paul O'Grady - following on from the million-copy-selling At My Mother's Knee - are, if anything, even more hilarious and outrageous than what has come before. As Paul struggles to get to grips with unexpected fatherhood and bereavement, he searches high and low for a job that lasts and somehow finds himself getting married in the process. Work takes him from an abattoir to a children's home, from a hospital to a nightclub, and from penthouse to pavement. Along the way, he takes his first-Savage steps on stage, tastes the exotic delights of Manila and invades Poland . . .To say that The Devil Rides Out is action-packed is an understatement. Its extraordinary cast of characters includes lords and ladies, the legendary Vera, a serial killer, more prostitutes than you can shake a stick at and drag queens of every shape and size. Wickedly funny, often moving, and searingly honest, Paul's tales of the unexpected will make your jaw drop and your hair stand on end. And you'll laugh like a drain.The Devil Rides Out - one hell of a read!",0593064240,9780593064245),Hardcover,,344 pages,"

With this continuation of Agee and Evans's project, Maharidge and Williamson not only uncover some surprising historical secrets relating to the families and to Agee himself, but also effectively lay to rest Agee's fear that his work, from lack of reverence or resilience, would be but another offense to the humanity of its subjects. Williamson's ninety-part photo essay includes updates alongside Evans's classic originals.

","There are two things everyone knows about Alexander Ridgely. One, he's the Duke of Ashbourne. And two, he has no plans to marry anytime soon...That is until a redheaded American throws herself in front of a carriage to save his young nephew's life. She's everything Alex never thought a woman could be—smart and funny, principled and brave. But she's a servant, completely unsuitable for a highborn duke—unless, perhaps, she's not quite what she seems...American heiress Emma Dunster might be surrounded by Englishmen, but that doesn't mean she intends to marry one—even if she has agreed to participate in one London Season. When she slipped out of her cousins' home, dressed as a kitchen maid, all she wanted was one last taste of anonymity before her debut. She never dreamed she'd find herself in the arms of a dangerously handsome duke... or that he'd be quite so upset when he discovered her true identity. But true love tends to blossom just when one least expects it, and passion can melt even the most stubborn of hearts.",0380780747,9780380780747),Mass Market Paperback,,396 pages,"

","An ambitious and startling debut novel that follows the lives of four women at a resort popular among slaveholders who bring their enslaved mistresseswench \'wench\ n. from Middle English ""wenchel,"" 1 a: a girl, maid, young woman; a female child.Tawawa House in many respects is like any other American resort before the Civil War. Situated in Ohio, this idyllic retreat is particularly nice in the summer when the Southern humidity is too much to bear. The main building, with its luxurious finishes, is loftier than the white cottages that flank it, but then again, the smaller structures are better positioned to catch any breeze that may come off the pond. And they provide more privacy, which best suits the needs of the Southern white men who vacation there every summer with their black, enslaved mistresses. It's their open secret.Lizzie, Reenie, and Sweet are regulars at Tawawa House. They have become friends over the years as they reunite and share developments in their own lives and on their respective plantations. They don't bother too much with questions of freedom, though the resort is situated in free territory–but when truth-telling Mawu comes to the resort and starts talking of running away, things change.To run is to leave behind everything these women value most–friends and families still down South–and for some it also means escaping from the emotional and psychological bonds that bind them to their masters. When a fire on the resort sets off a string of tragedies, the women of Tawawa House soon learn that triumph and dehumanization are inseparable and that love exists even in the most inhuman, brutal of circumstances–all while they are bearing witness to the end of an era.An engaging, page-turning, and wholly original novel, Wench explores, with an unflinching eye, the moral complexities of slavery.",006170654X,9780061706547),Hardcover,,290 pages,"

","Slave factories, a crucial but largely forgotten part of the slave trade, were bases on the African coast that existed to buy slaves and resell them to slaving ships. They were places of notorious suffering and exploitation, detested by both the natives and by white slavers.This story, in 12 brief chapters, focuses on the intersection of lives at one slave factory, Porto de Maria. Diego, its boss, is jaded. Matthew, its resident priest, has a terrible secret that drove him to Africa. Bowlu, his slave, struggles to find recompense for what he’s lost. William, the ageing captain of a visiting slaving ship, commands a divided crew, worries about interdiction at sea, and has come to Porto de Maria to determine his future. When these lives cross on the eve of the American Civil War, none of them will remain the same.From Martian Lit. More info at http://martianlit.com",146995673X,9781469956732),Paperback,,60 pages,"

","To hold onto his love, he must release his beast.Halle Shifters, Book 1Once a Bear sets his mind on a mission, it's best to stay out of his way. Alexander ""Bunny"" Bunsun is that Bear. Something's not right with his cousin Chloe, and he's come to Halle, PA, to sort it out, turn his Harley around and head home to Oregon. Until an enticing scent lures him into the local tattoo shop. There she is. An inked, Southern-drawled she-Wolf with lime-green hair. His perfect mate. Tabitha Garwood's rotten day just got worse. Her Outcast status makes her a target for harassment with alarming regularity. And now, in the middle of a root touch-up, looking like a half-melted Skittle, she's met her destined mate. The only upside? She finally has a protector in the form of a huge, tattooed, shaved-head Bear who vibrates with carefully restrained power. When Chloe is left for dead and Tabby is threatened, only Alex can keep his growing family safe. Giving Tabby the loving home she needs, though, could come at a price-Alex must give up the control he's worked a lifetime to attain. Which means someone could die at the hands-and claws-of his beast. Warning: This novel contains explicit sex, graphic language, a hunky Bear named Bunny and... Yes. I said a Bear named Bunny.

","At a New England boarding school, a sex scandal is about to break. Even more shocking than the sexual acts themselves is the fact that they were caught on videotape. A Pandora's box of revelations, the tape triggers a chorus of voices--those of the men, women, teenagers, and parents involved in the scandal--that details the ways in which lives can be derailed or destroyed in one foolish moment. Writing with a pace and intensity surpassing even her own greatest work, Anita Shreve delivers in Testimony a gripping emotional drama with the impact of a thriller. No one more compellingly explores the dark impulses that sway the lives of seeming innocents, the needs and fears that drive ordinary men and women into intolerable dilemmas, and the ways in which our best intentions can lead to our worst transgressions.",0316059862,9780316059862),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","« Si un écrivain a cherché à éclairer les lois profondes presque insaisissables de l'âme humaine, c'est Gérard de Nerval dans Sylvie. Cette histoire qu'on a qualifiée de peinture naïve, c'est le rêve d'un rêve. Gérard essaie de se souvenir d'une femme qu'il aimait en même temps qu'une autre. En évoquant ce temps dans un tableau de rêve, il est pris du désir de partir. Il arrive... dans un pays qui est plutôt pour lui un passé et ce qu'il voit alors, pour ainsi dire détaché par une nuit d'insomnie, est entremêlé si étroitement aux souvenirs qu'on est obligé à tout moment de tourner les pages qui précèdent pour voir où on se trouve... présent ou rappel du passé.La couleur de Sylvie est une couleur pourpre d'un rose pourpre en velours pourpre ou violacé, et nullement les tons aquarellés d'une France modérée. Gérard a trouvé le moyen de donner à son tableau les couleurs de son rêve. »Marcel Proust, Contre Sainte-Beuve.",225314620X,9782253146209),Mass Market Paperback,,87 pages,"

","Mary expected her seventeenth birthday to be a blowout to remember, courtesy of her best friends, fellow New York City prepsters Amy and Joon, and her doting boyfriend, Trick.            Instead, the day starts badly and gets worse. After waking up in a mortifying place with a massive, unexplainable hangover, Mary soon discovers that nobody at school is even aware that it's her birthday. As evening approaches, paranoia sets in. Mary just can't shake the feeling that someone is out to get her—and, as it turns out, she's right. Before the night is over, she's been killed in cold blood.            But murder is just the beginning of Mary's ordeal. Her soul gets trapped in a strange limbo, and she must relive the day of her death through the eyes of seven people—each of whom, she finds, had plenty of reasons to hate her. As Mary explores the mysteries of her world, discovering secrets that were hidden in plain sight while she was alive, she clings desperately to the hope that she can solve her own murder, change the past, and—just maybe—save her own life.            With its blend of suspense, horror, fantasy, and realism, 7 Souls is an adrenaline rush of a thriller.",0385736738,9780385736732),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","In this fascinating book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder takes us inside the everyday workings of Northampton, Massachusetts -- a place that seems to personify the typical American hometown. Kidder unveils the complex drama behind the seemingly ordinary lives of Northampton's residents. And out of these stories he creates a splendid, startling portrait of a town, in a narrative that gracefully travels among past and present, public and private, joy and sorrow.A host of real people are alive in these pages: a tycoon with a crippling ailment; a criminal whom the place has beguiled, a genial and merciful judge, a single mother struggling to start a new life at Smith College; and, at the center, a policeman who patrols the streets of his beloved hometown with a stern yet endearing brand of morality -- and who is about to discover the peril of spending a whole life in one small place. Their stories take us behind the town's facades and reveal how individuals shape the social conscience of a community. Home Town is an unflinching yet lovingly rendered account of how a traditional American town endures and evolves at the turn of the millenniums.",0671785214,9780671785215),Paperback,,464 pages,"

","The play is a kind of poetic and comic fable set in the twilight zone of the not-quite-true. At the Cafe Chez Francis, a group of promoters plot to tear up Paris in order to unearth the oil which a prospector believes he has located in the neighborhood. These grandiose plans come to the attention of The Madwoman of Chaillot who is ostensibly not normal in her mind but who is soon shown to be the very essence of practical worldly goodness and common sense. She sees through the crookedness of the prospector and insists that the world is being turned into an unhappy place by the thieves and those who are greedy for worldly goods and power. At a tea party attended by other ""mad"" women of Paris, she has brought together representatives of the despoilers of the earth and wreckers of its happiness, and has them tried and condemned to extermination. In a scene which mounts into the realms of high poetic comedy, she sends the culprits one by one, lured by the scent of oil and undreamed-of riches, into a bottomless pit which opens out of her cellar. The exodus of the wicked is accompanied by another and more beautiful miracle: Joy, justice and love return to the world again. """,0822207141,9780822207146),Paperback,,0 pages,"

","Here is an extraordinary new approach to healing by an extraordinary physician-writer -- a book filled with the mystery, wonder, and hope of people who have experienced seemingly miraculous recoveries from cancer and other serious illnesses.Dr. Deepak Chopra, a respected New England endocrinologist, began his search for answers when he saw patients in his own practice who completely recovered after being given only a few months to live. In the mid-1980's he returned to his native India to explore Ayurveda, humanity's most ancient healing tradition. Now he has brought together the current research of Western medicine, neuroscience, and physics with the insights of Ayurvedic theory to show that the human body is controlled by a ""network of intelligence"" grounded in quantum reality. Not a superficial psychological state, this intelligence lies deep enough to change the basic patterns that design our physiology -- with the potential to defeat cancer, heart disease, and even aging itself. In this inspiring and pioneering work, Dr. Chopra offers us both a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing.",0553348698,9780553348699),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","Shangguan Lu, dopo aver partorito sette figlie femmine, riesce finalmente ad avere l'agognato maschio, in grado di perpetuare la stirpe. Fabbri da generazioni, gli Shangguan vivono in un villaggio rurale della zona di Gaomi, nella provincia orientale dello Shandong; a seguito dell'uccisione degli uomini della famiglia da parte degli invasori giapponesi, la giovane madre si ritrova a dover crescere, da sola, il nuovo nato e le sorelline. È Jintong, il Bambino d'oro, l'io narrante del romanzo; frutto in realtà di un amore adulterino con il prete occidentale Ma Luoya, è il figlio prediletto e viziatissimo, allattato fin quasi all'adolescenza, che fa del seno l'icona feticistica di tutta la sua vita. Icona che cercherà crescendo nelle altre donne, a partire dalle sorelle, di cui segue da vicino i destini quanto mai diversi. Ciascuna di loro si legherà infatti a uomini spesso all'opposto per aspirazioni e carattere: proprietari terrieri e banditi patrioti, esponenti del Partito nazionalista e militanti del neonato Partito comunista, occidentali venuti a sostenere una delle fazioni in lotta e bizzarre e macchiettistiche figure. La parabola di ciascun personaggio si salda alla storia travagliata della Cina, dai tardi anni Trenta del conflitto sino-giapponese alle carneficine della guerra civile, fino all'avvento dell'era maoista e al suo superamento nell'ultimo ventennio del secolo appena trascorso.

Stefan Zweig's Marie Antoinette: The Portrait of an Average Woman is a dramatic account of the guillotine's most famous victim, from the time when as a fourteen-year-old she took Versailles by storm, to her frustrations with her aloof husband, her passionate love affair with the Swedish Count von Fersen, and ultimately to the chaos of the French Revolution and the savagery of the Terror. An impassioned narrative, Zweig's biography focuses on the human emotions of the participants and victims of the French Revolution, making it both an engrossingly compelling read and a sweeping and informative history.

Altamirano, gracias a su maestría narrativa, que por medio de un estilo sencillo y sobrio mantiene al lector en suspenso hasta el desenlace, mientras va enriqueciendo el relato con detalladas descripciones de lugares y costumbres.Clemencia es una historia sentimental en la que se plantea la diferencia entre el bien y el mal, los conflictos del hombre causados por la carne y el espíritu, en cuya trama avanza paralelo el contexto político y social de ese tiempo.En esta novela, Altamirano analiza con precisión la psicología de sus personajes, demostrando lo poco que ha evolucionado la naturaleza del ser humano, siempre envuelto enla ambición de poder y fortuna, viviendo los mismos dramas de amor, dentro de una sociedad que despreciaba al indio de igual manera como lo siguen haciendo muchas personas en nuestros días.Clemencia es una obra de romanticismo puramente mexicano que funde con sabiduría, el arte de escribir con el momento histórico de un país.",,,Paperback,,221 pages,"

","How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes uses illustration, humor, and accessible storytelling to explain complex topics of economic growth and monetary systems. In it, economic expert and bestselling author of Crash Proof, Peter Schiff teams up with his brother Andrew to apply their signature ""take no prisoners"" logic to expose the glaring fallacies that have become so ingrained in our country’s economic conversation.Inspired by How an Economy Grows and Why It Doesn’t—a previously published book by the Schiffs’ father Irwin, a widely published economist and activist—How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes incorporates the spirit of the original while tackling the latest economic issues.With wit and humor, the Schiffs explain the roots of economic growth, the uses of capital, the destructive nature of consumer credit, the source of inflation, the importance of trade, savings, and risk, and many other topical principles of economics.The tales told here may appear simple of the surface, but they will leave you with a powerful understanding of How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes.",047052670X,9780470526705),Hardcover,,233 pages,"

","A DEADLY HIGH   Magic-wielding Churchwitch and secret addict Chess Putnam knows better than anyone just how high a price people are willing to pay for a chemical rush. But when someone with money to burn and a penchant for black magic starts tampering with Downside’s drug supply, Chess realizes that the unlucky customers are paying with their souls—and taking the innocent with them, as the magic-infused speed compels them to kill in the most gruesome ways possible.   As if the streets weren’t scary enough, the looming war between the two men in her life explodes, taking even more casualties and putting Chess squarely in the middle. Downside could become a literal ghost town if Chess doesn’t find a way to stop both the war and the dark wave of death-magic, and the only way to do that is to use both her addiction and her power to enter the spell and chase the magic all the way back to its malevolent source. Too bad that doing so will probably kill Chess—if the war doesn’t first destroy the man who’s become her reason for living.",0345527526,9780345527523),Mass Market Paperback,1st Edition,376 pages,"

","The Vinyl Café Unplugged is the third book in Stuart McLean's Vinyl Café series, and like the one before it, Home from the Vinyl Café, it won the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour. This collection contains 14 delightful stories, many first broadcast on CBC Radio, about an idiosyncratic family of four in Toronto. Dave and Morley, the parents, and Sam and Stephanie, the children, lead a life of endless minor mishaps and misunderstandings.  In ""Odd Jobs,"" Dave, who owns a record store called the Vinyl Café, wants to install an outlet in his kitchen at home. Friends from the neighbourhood come over one by one to help until, by the end of the day, they have broken a window, chipped a sink, and left 15 large holes in the kitchen wall without managing to install an outlet. In ""The Razor's Edge,"" Dave leaves for the airport at 6:15 a.m. for a 7 o'clock flight. Arriving, he enters the wrong line and then gets lost. Reaching the gate with 45 seconds to spare, he finds it deserted and soon discovers he's two hours early. When an airline staffer arrives and remarks on how early he is, he says, ""I always try to be. I've never understood those people who wait until the last moment."" Whether they're trying to toilet train their cat, Galway, or figure out why the air conditioning cools every room except the one they sleep in, Dave and Morley and the kids keep their endless good humour and let us in on their secret lives. --Mark Frutkin",0140299149,9780140299144),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","Throughout his life Flaubert made it a game to eavesdrop for the cliché, the platitude, the borrowed and unquestioned idea with which the “right thinking” swaddle their minds. After his death his little treasury of absurdities, of half-truths and social lies, was published as a Dictionnaire des idées reçues. Because its devastating humor and irony are often dependent on the phrasing in vernacular French, the Dictionnaire was long considered untranslatable. This notion was taken as a challenge by Jacques Barzun. Determined to find the exact English equivalent for each “accepted idea” Flaubert recorded, he has succeeded in documenting our own inanities. With a satirist’s wit and a scholar’s precision, Barzun has produced a very contemporary self-portrait of the middle-class philistine, a species as much alive today as when Flaubert railed against him.",081120054X,9780811200547),Paperback,,92 pages,"

","Intuition deals with the difference between the intellectual, logical mind and the more encompassing realm of spirit. Logic is how the mind knows reality, intuition is how the spirit experiences reality. Osho's discussion of these matters is wonderfully lucid, occasionally funny, and thoroughly engrossing.All people have a natural capacity for intuition, but often social conditioning and formal education work against it. People are taught to ignore their instincts rather than to understand and use them as a foundation for individual growth and development-and in the process they undermine the very roots of the innate wisdom that is meant to flower into intuition. In this volume, Osho pinpoints exactly what intuition is and gives guidelines for how to identify its functioning in others and ourselves. You will learn to distinguish between genuine intuitive insight and the ""wishful thinking"" that can often lead to mistaken choices and unwanted consequences. Includes many specific exercises and meditations designed to nourish and support each individual's natural intuitive gifts. OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to experience life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India. More than a decade after his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.Intuition deals with the difference between the intellectual, logical mind and the more encompassing realm of spirit.

","Beginning on August 9, 1945, in Nagasaki, and ending in a prison cell in the US in 2002, as a man is waiting to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, Burnt Shadows is an epic narrative of love and betrayal.Hiroko Tanaka is twenty-one and in love with the man she is to marry, Konrad Weiss. As she steps onto her veranda, wrapped in a kimono with three black cranes swooping across the back, her world is suddenly and irrevocably altered. In the numbing aftermath of the atomic bomb that obliterates everything she has known, all that remains are the bird-shaped burns on her back, an indelible reminder of the world she has lost. In search of new beginnings, two years later, Hiroko travels to Delhi. It is there that her life will become intertwined with that of Konrad's half sister, Elizabeth, her husband, James Burton, and their employee Sajjad Ashraf, from whom she starts to learn Urdu. With the partition of India, and the creation of Pakistan, Hiroko will find herself displaced once again, in a world where old wars are replaced by new conflicts. But the shadows of history--personal and political--are cast over the interrelated worlds of the Burtons, the Ashrafs, and the Tanakas as they are transported from Pakistan to New York and, in the novel's astonishing climax, to Afghanistan in the immediate wake of 9/11. The ties that have bound these families together over decades and generations are tested to the extreme, with unforeseeable consequences.",0385666950,9780385666954),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

This scale is a measurement of your thoughts. To restore the same balance that characterizes everything in our universe, you have to take up the weighty thoughts so that they match up to your desires.The seasons reflect the overall harmony of life. For example, winter passes and the blossoms emerge. This is balanced by a need to have the trees rest, so autumn arrives on time and helps the trees ready themselves for another period of repose. This book is dedicated to the idea that we’re a vital component of this creative process and have within ourselves the wherewithal to create all that we want if we recognize and revise out-of-balance thoughts.",1401910386,9781401910389),Hardcover,,181 pages,"

In this volume, Stonewall's pious Christian character, service to the church, unwavering commitment to duty, affectionate role as husband and father, as well as his magnificent service to Virginia are carefully recorded by his close friend Robert Lewis Dabney. Labeled by some a religious fanatic, General Jackson was simply a consistent biblical Christian who lived out his faith every day, seriously and without compromise. Dabney's account of military life in the field with General Jackson provides poignant insight into the character of the General as they discuss theology and military history, pray together, and gallop to the sound of the guns. In a day bereft of true heroes, Stonewall's gallant deeds and virtuous conduct still move our hearts with admiration.

","What is Dr. Geisler warning the Christian community about in his book, Chosen But Free? A new cult? Secularism? False prophesy scenarios? No. Dr. Geisler is sounding the alarm about a system of beliefs commonly called ""Calvinism."" He insists that this belief system is ""theologically inconsistent, philosophically insufficient, and morally repugnant."" This book is written as a reply to Dr. Geisler, but is much more; it is a defense of the very principles upon which the Protestant Reformation was founded.",1879737434,9781879737433),Paperback,,358 pages,"

","For more than a decade two East End families have been locked in a bitter war.

On one side are the Mitchells, a notorious underworld mob from East London's Canning Town. They have an iron in every fire and will resort to intimidation and violence to get what they want. When Stanley Smith's lovely young daughter, Jessica, announces that she is to marry Eddie, the son of mob boss Harry Mitchell, Stanley is horrified, but too afraid to stand in their way.

On the other side are the O'Haras. The Mitchells' biggest rivals are a travelling family who live in nearby Stratford. They compete with the Mitchells for pub protection and the two families hate each other.

Caught between these two families at war, are two innocent children, who will grow up to love the wrong people and spark the last terrible act in the long-running feud. 1988 was a happy year in many people's lives. Some called it The Rave Year, others The Second Summer of Love. For Eddie Mitchell and his family it is neither. 1988 is the year in which his whole dangerous, violent world explodes around him.",,,Kindle Edition,,482 pages,"

","In darkness I count my blessings like Manman taught me. One: I am alive. Two: there is no two. In the aftermath of the Haitian earthquake a boy is trapped beneath the rubble of a ruined hospital: thirsty, terrified and alone. 'Shorty' is a child of the slums, a teenage boy who has seen enough violence to last a lifetime, and who has been inexorably drawn into the world of the gangsters who rule Site Soleil: men who dole out money with one hand and death with the other. But Shorty has a secret: a flame of revenge that blazes inside him and a burning wish to find the twin sister he lost five years ago. And he is marked. Marked in a way that links him with Toussaint L'Ouverture, the Haitian rebel who two-hundred years ago led the slave revolt and faced down Napoleon to force the French out of Haiti. As he grows weaker, Shorty relives the journey that took him to the hospital, a bullet wound in his arm. In his visions and memories he hopes to find the strength to survive, and perhaps then Toussaint can find a way to be free ...Watch the official book trailer for In Darkness",140881997X,9781408819975),Paperback,,337 pages,"

","Advertising director Charles Schine is just another New York commuter, regularly catching the 8.43 to work. But the day he misses his train is the day that changes his life. Catching the 9.05 instead, he can't help but be drawn by the sight of the person opposite. Charles has never cheated on his wife in eighteen years of marriage. But then Charles has never met anyone like Lucinda Harris before. Charming, beautiful and a seductively good listener, Charles finds himself instantly attracted. And though Lucinda is married too, it is immediately apparent that the feeling is mutual. Their journeys into work become lunch dates, which become cocktails and eventually lead to a rented room in a seedy hotel. They both know the risks they are taking, but not in their worst nightmares could they foresee what is to follow. Suddenly their temptation turns horrifically sour, and their illicit liaison becomes caught up in something bigger, more dangerous, more brutally violent. Unable to talk to his partner or the police, Charles finds himself trapped in a world of dark conspiracy and psychological games. Somehow he's got to find a way to fight back, or his entire life will be spectacularly derailed for good.",0316725366,9780316725361),,,,,"['Thriller', 'Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Mystery', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller', 'Mystery', 'Crime']"

","Among the stories published between the wars there are several characters who dominate the tales in which they appear and seem similarly to stand for a whole category of human experience. An example is the heroine of the of the story “Anika's Times“(1931). Anika is a woman who wreaks havoc in Višegrad through the unpredictable distribution of her favours. The impact she made is still spoken of when the story opens, several generations later. Anika is a self-willed creature whose defiance of convention – flouted initially out of pique with a particular young man – predictably brings her no happiness to the extent that she welcomes the prospect of the inevitable retribution her as a relief for herself and others: “It would be an act of charity of someone would kill me”, she repeats several times before her death. In this way Anika herself is not entirely in control of her destiny, but is the vehicle of an overwhelming power over men. The story of Anika is given an additional dimension in the form of an explanatory introduction the exact meaning of which is perhaps not immediately clear, but emerges from the account of “Anika’s Times”. This introduction describes the growing schizophrenia of the parish priest of a village outside Višegrad and his obsessive, furtive watching of women. As long as the villagers speak of him they tend to be reminded also of Anika. There is only a tenuous connection between her and father Vujadin, so that the association of the two stories in the villagers’ minds seems to suggest a more profound link. Vujadin’s madness is not directly attributable to his experience of women; he has become cut off from his fellow-men by a variety of factors. But as he steadily loses touch with society, women seem to loom ever larger in his consciousness. In this aspect of his madness that seems to disturb the villagers and urge them to give it form in their recollection of the legend of Anika. Within the framework of the story “Anika's Times“, this introduction appears as a kind of meditation on man's perennial need to control and account for his powerful response to woman, the need which led to the creation of the legend of Adam and Eve.",,,Hardcover,,122 pages,"

","History meets horse racing in this grand, galloping story about what happened when the greatest horse from the North met the greatest horse from the South.In the early 1800s, the notion of sport was still quite new to America, unless you counted cockfighting, chasing foxes, or hunting stags. But on a bright afternoon in May 1823 a horse race held at the Union Course on Long Island changed everything. Astonishingly, sixty thousand people attended -- a number equal to roughly half the population of New York City at the time. Two horses -- the best from the North and the best from the South -- battled it out in three grueling heats, the equivalent of nine Kentucky Derbys, in only a couple of hours. And the whole thing was based on an outrageous dare.In a fast-paced narrative -- colorful, rich, and full of record-setting performances and towering personalities -- John Eisenberg chronicles the story of the year in which two horses were seen as embodying a nation racing inevitably toward civil war. Eclipse was the majestic champion representing the North’s evolving industrial machine, and Henry was an equine arriviste embodying southern perceptions of superiority. Their thrilling match race would come to represent a watershed moment in American history, crystallizing the differences that so fundamentally divided North and South. Along the way, we come to know millionaire industrialists, broken-down jockeys, tobacco planters, politicians, and slaves -- not to mention two amazing horses.A unique blend of horse racing, history, and good old-fashioned storytelling, The Great Match Race provides a telling glimpse of a nation dividing, some forty years before the Civil War; a fascinating look at the early heritage of the American thoroughbred; and the first example of the sports spectacle as we know it.",0618556125,9780618556120),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

In the manner of Fifty Shades of Grey, Vina Jackson's compelling, pulse-racing trilogy is a mouth-watering feast for the senses.
Caught in a frustrating relationship with a man who can't accept her for who she is, passionate, flame-haired violinist Summer finds release in her music. She spends her afternoons busking on the underground, lost in the works of Vivaldi or Mendelssohn.

","Molti bambini, intorno ai sei anni, sognano di dedicarsi da grandi ai più disparati mestieri: il poliziotto, il macchinista, il pompiere. Gerald Durrell sognava di avere uno zoo. Con tenacia, rimase fedele al suo desiderio, finché riuscì ad aprire davvero, nell’isola di Jersey, un suo zoo, che è tuttora in funzione e si pone come primo obiettivo quello di contribuire a salvare le specie in pericolo. Per Durrell lo zoo è così diventato una forma di vita: per lui significa svegliarsi all’alba alle voci degli svariati animali, che egli riconosce una per una, e poi passare la giornata affrontando i più umili e bizzarri problemi, trattando gli animali come propri conviventi, in un rapporto di felice intimità, che Durrell riesce a trasmetterci in tutti i suoi libri, e particolarmente in questo, che alla storia del suo zoo è dedicato. Le risse del trombettiere Trombi e di due pinguini, la laboriosa uscita di tante tartarughine dal loro uovo, il recupero di un tapiro fuggito, un matrimonio combinato fra gorilla: attraverso queste pagine ricche di movimento (e di insegnamenti) seguiamo Durrell in tutte le vicissitudini della sua vita quotidiana nello zoo di Jersey, vissute e raccontate dallo scienziato e insieme dal bambino che le aveva sognate.

Su poesía se caracteriza por un hondo intimismo y una severa sensualidad. En palabras de Octavio Paz, la obra de Pizarnik lleva a cabo una “cristalización verbal por amalgama de insomnio pasional y lucidez meridiana en un disolución de realidad sometida a las más altas temperaturas” y Pieyre de Mandiargues le escribió, con motivos de la publicación de Extracción de la piedra de locura: “Tengo amor a tus poemas: querría que hicieras muchos y que tus poemas difundieran por todas partes el amor y el terror”.",8426428258,9788426428257),Paperback,,470 pages,"

","Lysander Hawkley combined breathtaking good looks with the kindest of hearts. He couldn't pass a stray dog, an ill-treated horse or a neglected wife without rushing to the rescue. And with neglected wives the rescue invariably led to ecstatic bonking, which didn't please their erring husbands one bit.Lysander's mid-life crisis had begun at twenty-two. Reeling from the death of his beautiful mother, he was out of work, drinking too much and desperately in debt. The solution came from Ferdie, his fat, fast-operating friend: if Lysander was so good at making husbands jealous, why shouldn't he get paid for it?Let loose among the neglected wives of the ritzy county of Rutshire, Lysander causes absolute havoc. But it is only when he meets Rannaldini, Rutshire's King Rat of Rutshire and a temperamental, fiendishly promiscuous international conductor, that the trouble really starts. The only unglamorous woman around Rannaldini was Kitty, his plump young wife who ran his life like clockwork. Soon Lysander was convinced that Kitty must be rescued from Rannaldini at all costs, even if it means enlisting the help of the old blue-eyed havoc maker: Rupert Campbell-Black.",0552138959,9780552138956),Paperback,,736 pages,"

I've looked into the eyes of women who have banged nine-inch nails into the skulls of their victims with hammers ... we evaluate them, trying to determine whether they have actually changed, or whether there's still a core of evil within them...Before his diagnosis, DCI Mark Lapslie thought everyone was like him. Now he knows he suffers from synaethesthesia - a rare neurological condition that has cross-wired his senses. The sickening clamour of sounds he can taste has smothered his marriage and stifled his career.At the scene of a fatal traffic accident, Lapslie's interest isn't in the recently deceased driver, rather the desiccated corpse found lying next to him. Something about the body stirs a fleeting recollection at the back of Lapslie's mind... he can't quite put his finger on it, but he can almost taste it...Memories haunt Violet Chambers. Taking tea with her friend Daisy, she knows it's time to move on. As Daisy falls to the floor, eyes streaming, face burning, Violet calmly waits. Black hellebore is remarkably potent.

","Something is profoundly wrong with the way we think about how we should live today.In Ill Fares The Land, Tony Judt, one of our leading historians and thinkers, reveals how we have arrived at our present dangerously confused moment. Judt masterfully crystallizes what we’ve all been feeling into a way to think our way into, and thus out of, our great collective dis-ease about the current state of things.As the economic collapse of 2008 made clear, the social contract that defined postwar life in Europe and America – the guarantee of a basal level of security, stability and fairness -- is no longer guaranteed; in fact, it’s no longer part of the common discourse. Judt offers the language we need to address our common needs, rejecting the nihilistic individualism of the far right and the debunked socialism of the past. To find a way forward, we must look to our not so distant past and to social democracy in action: to re-enshrining fairness over mere efficiency.Distinctly absent from our national dialogue, social democrats believe that the state can play an enhanced role in our lives without threatening our liberties. Instead of placing blind faith in the market—as we have to our detriment for the past thirty years—social democrats entrust their fellow citizens and the state itself.Ill Fares the Land challenges us to confront our societal ills and to shoulder responsibility for the world we live in. For hope remains. In reintroducing alternatives to the status quo, Judt reinvigorates our political conversation, providing the tools necessary to imagine a new form of governance, a new way of life.",1594202761,9781594202766),Hardcover,,237 pages,"

","Sebastian Locke, the fifty-six-year-old patriarch of a powerful American family, is handsome, charismatic, and a man of immense charm and intelligence. He is the chairman of the philanthropic Locke Foundation, funded by the vast family fortune built by his forefathers. Committed to relieving the suffering of those in genuine need, Locke travels the globe giving away millions a year to the poor, the sick, and the innocent victims of natural disasters and wars. He is seen as a beacon of light in today's darkly violent world.That is why the police are profoundly baffled when Sebastian Locke is found dead at his country estate under mysterious circumstances. Has he been murdered? And if so, who would have wanted to kill the world's greatest philanthropist? Could such an upstanding man have had enemies?Vivienne Trent, an American journalist, had been fascinated by Locke as a child, married him when she was a young woman, then later divorced him, but had always stayed close to him. Aware that there had been another side to this enigmatic man, she sets out to find the truth about his death and about Locke himself, much to the annoyance of his two grown children, who find her obsession irritating.As she prepares to write a profile of Locke for the London Sunday Times, Vivienne uncovers startling revelations, revelations that turn her life around.",0061092088,9780061092084),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","My name is Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith, and my age is three hundred and eighty-four years. Each new settlement asks for a new journal, and so this Book of Shadows begins.In the spring of 1628, the Witchfinder of Wessex finds himself a true Witch. As Bess Hawksmith watches her mother swing from the Hanging Tree she knows that only one man can save her from the same fate at the hands of the panicked mob: the Warlock Gideon Masters, and his Book of Shadows. Secluded at his cottage in the woods, Gideon instructs Bess in the Craft, awakening formidable powers she didn't know she had and making her immortal. She couldn't have foreseen that even now, centuries later, he would be hunting her across time, determined to claim payment for saving her life.In present-day England, Elizabeth has built a quiet life for herself, tending her garden and selling herbs and oils at the local farmers' market. But her solitude abruptly ends when a teenage girl called Tegan starts hanging around. Against her better judgment, Elizabeth begins teaching Tegan the ways of the Hedge Witch, in the process awakening memories—and demons—long thought forgotten.Part historical romance, part modern fantasy, The Witch’s Daughter is a fresh, compelling take on the magical, yet dangerous world of Witches. Readers will long remember the fiercely independent heroine who survives plagues, wars, and the heartbreak that comes with immortality to remain true to herself, and protect the protégé she comes to love.",031262168X,9780312621681),Hardcover,,305 pages,"

","FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHORS OF THREE SECONDS...Detective Superintendent Ewert Grens of THREE SECONDS returns in a riveting mystery that centers on perhaps the most controversial subject in the modern criminal justice system: the death penalty.In Ohio, seventeen-year-old John Meyer Frey rots on Death Row for the brutal murder of his girlfriend. The victim's father hungers for revenge, while a prison guard is torn by compassion for the young man. When Frey unexpectedly dies of heart disease before he either receives his just punishment or achieves redemption, the wheels of justice grind to a halt. Six years later, on a ferry between Finland and Sweden, a singer named John Schwarz viciously attacks a drunken lout harassing a woman, leaving the man in a coma. The Stockholm police arrest Schwarz for aggravated assault, but when Grens learns that the assailant has been living in Sweden under a false identity, he begins to suspect that something darker and more complex underlies the incident. Following his intuition, Grens launches an investigation that spans from Sweden to the United States and reveals a startling connection between the Frey and Schwarz cases. Featuring a multilayered plot with a killer twist, CELL 8 takes readers on a gripping, page-turning journey that explores the devastating repercussions of the death penalty as well as the fallout from the conflicting desires for public justice and private retribution.",1402787154,9781402787157),Hardcover,,370 pages,"

","A son of a forest dwelling people, Yhalen knows little of the world outside the ancestral forest, until he is captured by a band of ogres on a slave-taking mission. Only grim tales of the barbaric giants had reached the forest, but Yhalen soon learns that even the darkest fireside story only hinted at the brutality of these Northern warriors. He discovers the meaning of true fear at their hands, and only the awakening of ancient magic saves him from destruction.Surviving ogre viciousness, he finds himself given to Bloodraven, the half ogre, half human war leader as a slave. Yhalen, refusing to bend, soon pays the price for offending prickly ogre pride.But Bloodraven is no mindless, violent ogrish beast. Bloodraven has an agenda and Yhalen finds himself drawn in the wake into human and ogre politics, into bloodshed and cruelty and into the forbidden magic that is damnation in the eyes of his own people, but which might mean the difference between death and salvation.Note: Lulu's page count of 287 is for the PB (and PDF) versions.

","From Publishers Weekly:It's tough to tell the difference between teacher and students in Azuma's comedy. Teacher Yukari Tanizaki is oblivious, immature, emotional and one of the people shaping young minds. Her students face difficulties in school that most never imagined. For example, as one pupil starts to ask a question, Miss Yukari cuts him off, stating she won't talk about her bra size. Another group of students are ready for their lessons, but instead of learning about social studies or science, they learn how Miss Yukari spent her weekend. Maybe that's not so bad, considering Miss Yukari's not the brightest bulb in the bunch and has her students correcting her on many technical points. Her students aren't sure how to react, but their bewilderment is half the charm of this manga. Like the 1980s TV series Head of the Class, Azu has an eclectic mix of pupils ranging from child geniuses to sports enthusiasts to tough girls; each possessing much more than meets the eye. The precocious child genius may be great at academic subjects, but she still draws like a little girl and has the emotions of a kid. The unemotional tough teen melts for tiny animals and longs to have a pet of her own, even if all of the creatures she comes in contact with seem to hate her. The art is simple and minimalistic, but adequately conveys the thought and emotion behind each strip. Azuma's cast has depth, dimension and character, and their story heartily entertains.Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

","Brunel very nearly amazed us all by being named outright winner on BBC television's Greatest Britons, where he was presented by Jeremy Clarkson. In this biography, Adrian Vaughan draws on a range of evidence to reveal not just an engineer of genius, a fountain of original ideas and nervous energy, a born actor and courageous leader, but also a man who was obstinate, unjust, dictatorial and in the end paranoid. insecurities he confided only to a journal he kept locked. His drive cost others dear: lives and fortunes were lost in the execution of his dramatic projects. He was an engineering knight-errant, not interested in mundane solutions but in daring experiments that would make him famous. Brunel's superbly engineered railways and bridges, and three great ships, serve as his monument. Much of his work is still in place, as serviceable as when it was first built. But he sold his soul to ambition, and like Faust he paid.",0719557488,9780719557484),Paperback,,285 pages,"

","Why would someone choose the BDSM lifestyle of consensual bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, sado-masochism as a means to heal from a traumatic and abusive past? DESCRIPTION: NOBODY'S PERFECT is the continuing story of Savannah Gentry (now Savi Baker) and Damian Orlando from MASTERS AT ARMS & NOBODY’S ANGEL (Rescue Me Saga #1) and NOBODY'S HERO (#2). Savannah/Savi escaped eleven years of abuse at the hands of her father and finally made a safe life for herself and her daughter. But when her father once again threatens her peace of mind—and her daughter’s safety—Savi runs to Damian Orlando for protection. Eight years earlier as Savannah, she shared one perfect day with Damian that changed both their young lives and resulted in a secret she no longer can hide. But being with Damian reawakens repressed memories and feelings she wants to keep buried. After witnessing a scene with Damian on Savi's first night at his private club, however, she begins to wonder if he could help her regain control of her life and reclaim her sexuality and identity. Damian, a wounded warrior, has had his own dragons to fight in life, but has never forgotten Savannah. He will lay down his life to protect her and her daughter, but doesn’t believe he can offer more than that. She deserves a whole man, something he can never be after a firefight in Iraq. Damian has turned to SM to regain control of his life and emotions and fulfills the role of Service Top to “bottoms” at the club. However, he could never deliver those services to Savi, who needs someone gentle and loving, not the man he has become. Will two wounded survivors find love and healing in each other’s arms? ABOUT THE RESCUE ME SAGA: The books in the ongoing Rescue Me Saga are not stand-alone stories and should be read in order. Characters will recur in later books to deal with further issues in their lives as the saga continues and each book builds upon all previous ones. Sometimes main characters even need another book to help resolve major issues affecting their relationships. BONUS MATERIAL in this version: Kallypso Masters has added the PLAYLIST of music that inspired her as she wrote about the first three couples mentioned in this combined volume, as well as a GLOSSARY OF TERMS and a CAST OF CHARACTERS in these books in the saga. CONTENT WARNING: Intended for mature adult readers not offended by profanity and graphic (but never gratuitous!) sex scenes. Due to the emotional way in which the author presents the subject matter (past and present), the books might cause triggers while reading. Please read the Author's Notes at the beginning.",,,Kindle Edition,,468 pages,"

He quickly matured into one of the most formidable Crip combat soldiers, earning the name “Monster” for committing acts of brutality and violence that repulsed even his fellow gang members. When the inevitable jail term confined him to a maximum-security cell, a complete political and personal transformation followed: from Monster to Sanyika Shakur, black nationalist, member of the New Afrikan Independence Movement, and crusader against the causes of gangsterism. In a document that has been compared to The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver’s Soul on Ice, Shakur makes palpable the despair and decay of America’s inner cities and gives eloquent voice to one aspect of the black ghetto experience today.""",0802141447,9780802141446),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Pedigree is Georges Simenon’s longest, most unlikely, and most adventurous novel, the book that is increasingly seen to lie at the heart of his outsize achievement as a chronicler of modern self and society. In the early 1940s, Simenon began work on a memoir of his Belgian childhood. He showed the initial pages to André Gide, who urged him to turn them into a novel. The result was, Simenon later quipped, a book in which everything is true but nothing is accurate. Spanning the years from the beginning of the century, with its political instability and terrorist threats, to the end of the First World War in 1918, Pedigree is an epic of everyday existence in all its messy unfinished intensity and density, a story about the coming-of-age of a precocious and curious boy and the coming to be of the modern world.",1590173511,9781590173510),Paperback,,560 pages,"

","Life after death was not all they expected for Blake Stillwater and his family. Some went to live in the light. Another went into darkness. Blake fights for survival against the forces of evil, somewhere between, in the Realm of the Middle Damned. At this crossroads, which connect the dimensions of the Living World and the hereafter, failure is a one-way ticket to everlasting torment in the lake of fire. Blake’s only hope lies in the gifts of those he was responsible for in the car crash that claimed their lives. The blood staining his hands entitles them to endow him with a final token of their memory. It’s a race against time, for while the gifts of those who love the light will sustain, the one who now dwells in darkness can ruin it all. Blake may well survive, but when it’s found his spirit is tied to a comatose body in the Living World, existence becomes a fight for control of his soul. With demon-possessed and Willing Servants of the Dark seeking to use him as a gateway between worlds, a band of heroes dedicated to righteousness rallies to his aid. All Middle Damned are now threatened by demons in their natural formscoming through the portal against them. The odds are stacked high and on the verge of defeat a new thought distracts Blake. Is what he works toward real or is he lost in a coma-induced dream? In an attempt to get back to those of his family who survived, Blake will be willing to risk it all, and the rest be Damned.",1478206284,9781478206286),Paperback,1,348 pages,"

","Building on her signature message of using the mind to master difficult emotions, Joyce Meyer focuses on the most destructive, insidious one of all: anger. It is responsible for broken relationships, sleepless nights, high blood pressure and ulcers. It destroys friendships, marriages and families, not to mention peace of mind. Anger is especially hard to handle for many Christians who have learned from childhood that ""good Christians don't get angry."" Meyer argues that properly handled, anger is an alert system that something is wrong and needs to be resolved.In her latest book, she delves into the important process of forgiving, explaining its positive impact on the roots, the forms and the results of anger.Why forgive? Joyce explains that forgiving is the only thing that can free one from the terrible turmoil that anger causes to spill over into every part of life.Meyer understands that life will never be fair, but that is not a reason to let anger destroy our well-being and health. This is her guide to navigating that thorny territory and finding true peace. ",0446547271,9780446547277),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","In the 21st century, the glittering Neo-Tokyo has risen from the rubble of a Tokyo destroyed by an apocalyptic telekinetic blast from a young boy called Akira -- the subject of a covert government experiment gone wrong now imprisoned in frozen stasis. But Tetsuo, an angry young man with immense and rapidly growing psychic abilities, has done the unthinkable: he has released Akira and set into motion a chain of events that could once destroy the city and drag the world to the brink of Armageddon. Resistance agents and an armada of government forces race against the clock to find the child with godlike powers before his unthinkable destructive abilities are unleashed! One of the true international classics of graphic fiction and unavailable for nearly a decade in America, Akira has once again taken America by storm, its first Dark Horse volume selling out almost overnight in comic shops and bookstores across the country!",1569715254,9781569715253),Paperback,,282 pages,"

The remnants of humanity survived as best they could on Shylmahn-controlled reservations or hidden away in tiny communities out of sight of the masters of the planet.Most humans had never known a world not dominated by the Shylmahn. Most were content to silently live out their lives in the shadows, ever fearful of drawing attention to themselves.The surviving members of the Britton family were not content. These few were the battle-weary veterans of an all-but-forgotten war long since lost.

","From an award-winning historian, a stirring (and timely) narrative history of American labor from the dawn of the industrial age to the present day.  From the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, the first real factories in America, to the triumph of unions in the twentieth century and their waning influence today, the con­test between labor and capital for their share of American bounty has shaped our national experience. Philip Dray’s ambition is to show us the vital accomplishments of organized labor in that time and illuminate its central role in our social, political, economic, and cultural evolution. There Is Power in a Union is an epic, character-driven narrative that locates this struggle for security and dignity in all its various settings: on picket lines and in union halls, jails, assembly lines, corporate boardrooms, the courts, the halls of Congress, and the White House. The author demonstrates, viscerally and dramatically, the urgency of the fight for fairness and economic democracy—a struggle that remains especially urgent today, when ordinary Americans are so anxious and beset by eco­nomic woes.",0385526296,9780385526296),Hardcover,,784 pages,"

","Against His-Story, Against Leviathan! is a 1983 book by Fredy Perlman, for which he is best known. It is a personal critical perspective on contemporary civilization and society. The work defined anarcho-primitivism for the first time, and was a major source of inspiration for anti-civilization perspectives in contemporary anarchism, most notably on the thought of philosopher John Zerzan. In 2006 the book was translated into French under the title Contre le Léviathan, contre sa légende and into Turkish as Er-Tarih’e Karşı, Leviathan’a Karşı.",0934868255,9780934868259),Paperback,,302 pages,"

","A true story from award-winning journalist Sonia Nazario recounting the odyssey of a Honduran boy who braves hardship and peril to reach his mother in the United States.In this astonishing true story, award-winning journalist Sonia Nazario recounts the unforgettable odyssey of a Honduran boy who braves unimaginable hardship and peril to reach his mother in the United States. When Enrique is five years old, his mother, Lourdes, too poor to feed her children, leaves Honduras to work in the United States. The move allows her to send money back home to Enrique so he can eat better and go to school past the third grade.Lourdes promises Enrique she will return quickly. But she struggles in America. Years pass. He begs for his mother to come back. Without her, he becomes lonely and troubled. When she calls, Lourdes tells him to be patient. Enrique despairs of ever seeing her again. After eleven years apart, he decides he will go find her.Enrique sets off alone from Tegucigalpa, with little more than a slip of paper bearing his mother's North Carolina telephone number. Without money, he will make the dangerous and illegal trek up the length of Mexico the only way he can – clinging to the sides and tops of freight trains.With gritty determination and a deep longing to be by his mother's side, Enrique travels through hostile, unknown worlds. Each step of the way through Mexico, he and other migrants, many of them children, are hunted like animals. Gangsters control the tops of the trains. Bandits rob and kill migrants up and down the tracks. Corrupt cops all along the route are out to fleece and deport them. To evade Mexican police and immigration authorities, they must jump onto and off the moving boxcars they call El Tren de la Muerte- The Train of Death. Enrique pushes forward using his wit, courage, and hope - and the kindness of strangers. It is an epic journey, one thousands of immigrant children make each year to find their mothers in the United States.Based on the Los Angeles Times newspaper series that won two Pulitzer Prizes, one for feature writing and another for feature photography, Enrique's Journey is the timeless story of families torn apart, the yearning to be together again, and a boy who will risk his life to find the mother he loves.",0812971787,9780812971781),Paperback,,294 pages,"

","This hysterical hobbyist's guide belongs in every hip library. Coot cat Reverend Ivan Stang, high holy of the Church of the SubGenius, has compiled a bestiary of American creeps and crazies so that you can write to them and receive mail that is weird, horrible, wonderfully absurd, or a combination of all three. Each entry has a paragraph or two and the last known mailing address of some fringe loonies. The book is only current through 1988, though; the only thing wrong with it is that it's high time for an update--with URLs, of course. Let's see ... there are catalogs of perpetual motion machines; brochures from South American flying saucer cults; something called ""The Battle Cry of Aggressive Christianity"" (Christian, not likely--aggressive, you bet); and bizarre roundups such as ""News of the Weird,"" the Church of Beaver Cleaver, and so on. What makes this book so funny is the author's willingness to list (and ridicule) any group, no matter how repulsive. This means, too, that High Weirdness contains a group to offend everyone; consider yourself warned. In fact, if you aren't offended by some of these groups, you must be pretty offensive yourself.

","Az író új regénye egyrészt szabályos diákregény, mulattató, néha tragikumba forduló diákcsínyekkel, ártatlan vagy borsos kamasztréfákkal, ugyanakkor jóval több is ennél: egy társadalom lélektani regénye. A Horthy-korszak leendő katonatisztjeinek neveléséről, a határszéli kadétiskoláról szól a regény, ahová az úrifiúkat küldik, hogy a legérzékenyebb kamaszkorban történő kínzatások és az embertelen fegyelembe való nevelés után legtöbben maguk is nevelőikhez hasonló kínzókká, fegyelmezőkké legyenek.

Ottlik hitelesen és nagy művészettel ábrázolja ezt a testi-lelki terrort, aminek védtelenül ki vannak szolgáltatva ezek a kamaszok, és azt a folyamatot, amely odáig zülleszti őket, hogy ezt a természetellenes világot természetesnek és egyedül lehetségesnek fogadják el. A kadétiskola komor, baljós épülete a húszas évek ellenforradalmi Magyarországának szimbóluma – és a regény ennek a szimbólumnak társadalmi és erkölcsi tartalmát, valóságát mutatja be, ítéletet mondva fölötte.",,,Paperback,,440 pages,"

","Un amor inesperado en los salones de Buenos Aires.Corre el año 1876, y la presidencia de Nicolás Avellaneda se estremece bajo los ecos de una frustrada revolución. La crisis económica sacude al país y el encono partidario entre mitristas y alsinistas desborda los cafés y las calles de Buenos Aires.La colonización agrícola se yergue como una promesa en los rostros de los inmigrantes que llegan en oleadas: los taños, los turcos, los gaitas y los rusos cambian la fisonomía de una ciudad que deja atrás su pasado de Gran Aldea.A ese escenario turbulento regresa Julián Zaldívary Durand, y retoma los lazos que lo unían a la clase dirigente.Sin embargo, no es el mismo de antes. La sociedad porteña se horrorizaría si supiese lo que el soltero más codiciado del momento esconde en su propia casa. El hombre que regresa a su tierra a lamerse las heridas, como el león a su madriguera, se verá envuelto en toda clase de intrigas: políticas y de alcoba. Él, que había jurado no volver a enamorarse. Una mujer ilícita, una viuda intrigante, una joven desamparada y un antiguo amor ponen a prueba esa decisión. Entre los debates de los hacendados en la Sociedad Rural, la xenofobia en las pampas y los misterios del universo femenino, Julián Zaldívar, porteño nacido en cuna de oro, se enfrentará a los fantasmas de su propio pasado.En la más intimista de todas sus novelas, la autora pinta un fresco de la Buenos Aires de las últimas décadas del siglo XIX, con todos los matices que la convirtieron en la Reina del Plata.",9506442614,9789506442613),Paperback,,616 pages,"

","Het bewogen leven van Vincent van Gogh blijft een onuitputtelijke inspiratiebron. Stripmaker Barbara Stok neemt in dit verhaal de lezer mee naar de korte, intense periode die de schilder in Zuid-Frankrijk doorbrengt. Vincent droomt ervan in Arles een kunstenaarshuis te stichten voor zichzelf en zijn artistieke vrienden. Maar door aanvallen waarin hij volledig in de war is, uitmondend in het beruchte oorincident, valt die droom in duigen. Zijn broer Theo blijft hem onvoorwaardelijk steunen. Van Gogh was een kunstenaar vol hartstocht voor zijn vak. Zijn ideeën over succes, tegenslag en een zinvol leven vormen een interessant tegenwicht in onze tijd van individualisme, maakbaarheid en economisch denken. Zo maakt Stok van de belevenissen van deze 19de-eeuwse schilder weer een actueel verhaal.",,,Paperback,,141 pages,"

","Dari sisa ingatan dan catatan minim, mantan enam rekan (Freddy Lasut sudah almarhum) perjalanan Soe Hok-gie (27 tahun) dan Idhan Dhanvantari Lubis (20), berusaha menulis ulang kesaksian sebenarnya tragedi perjalanan pendakian ke Gunung Semeru, nun 40 tahun lalu.Aristides Katoppo (71): “Hok-gie terlalu cepat pergi, tapi kalau dia hidup dan sekarang sudah umur 67 tahun, apa dia tahan tidak bikin ribut-ribut?” Komentar Tides yang 40 tahun lalu, meminta bantuan helikopter TNI-AL untuk turun di alun-alun kota Malang, lalu ikut heli itu mengapung dan terkurung kabut tebal di kaki Semeru.Maman Abdurachman (65): “Saya mungkin shock dan dehidrasi, hingga menganggu kondisi dan stres. Tapi saya tidak kesurupan, saya sadar kok, cuma merasa badan panas sekali,” ujar Maman yang tidak trauma dan tidak melarang putrinya menjadi pendaki gunung Mapala UI juga.Herman Onesimus Lantang (69): “Saya yang memimpin evakuasi jenasah Hok-Gie dan Idhan, tentu dengan dukungan tim besar dari Malang dan Jakarta, bukan sendirian,” ujar Herman yang ketimpa sial juga. “Masih lelah dan baru masuk ke kota Malang, gua diinterogasi polisi, diperiksa dan diminta kesaksian tentang Hok-Gie dan Idhan itu bukan korban pembunuhan di Semeru.”Anton Wijana alias Wiwiek (63): “Aku satu-satunya anggota tim yang fasih berbahasa Jawa, makanya aku diajak turun duluan bareng Tides, untuk minta bantuan ke Malang dan Jakarta. Yang terjadi kemudian, ya kerja sama kemanusiaan sejati,” kata Wiwiek yang mengenang solidaritas zaman dirinya aktif di pergerakan anak-anak jaket kuning UI.Rudy Badil (64): “Saya datang, saya lihat, saya rasakan, saya pulang, saya bertanggung jawab dan saya menulis kembali kesaksian peristiwa 40 tahun lalu itu,” ujarnya, seraya menjelaskan sulitnya merekonstruksi ingatan masa 40 tahun lalu. “Salah-salah dikit, harap maklum.”---oOo---Soe Hok-Gie … sekali lagi, diharapkan menjadi buku baru sekali lagi tentang Soe Hok-gie, berisikan kisah saksi hidup pendakian di zaman awal Orde Baru. Juga saksi-saksi teman dan konco dekat Hok-gie dalam soal “buku pesta dan cinta di kampus UI Rawamangun-Salemba”, tentu juga perihal alam bangsanya yang baru menapak di zaman pembangunan – sebelum menapak ke zaman reformasi.Buku baru tentang Soe Hok-gie ini, khususnya akan memuat komentar dan telaah penulis dan pengamat “cuaca” sosial budaya politik budaya Indonesia. Rupanya ada kemiripan yang tidak sama tapi nyaris serupa, antara situasi sekarang dan 40-an tahun lalu.Ini buku tentang perilaku dan pemikiran terhadap keadaan bangsa dan negara. Sebab dari kumpulan tulisan pilihan Hok-gie, rasanya masih cocok sebagai “bumbu bandingan”, perihal politik pemerintahan, di zamannya Hok-gie sebagai penulis muda di usia di tahun 1963-1969, sampai di zaman reformasi 2009n ini.Rekan seprofesi, mantan anak-anak gerakan Orde Baru pun, masih sempat menulis tentang Hok-gie. Bukan pengamat senior saja, malah beberapa pengamat dan pemerhati yang tidak sempat berkenalan dengan Soe, ikutan menyumbangkan buah pikirannya dalam buku kecil 400-an halaman yang akan terbit khusus, di hari peringatan meninggalnya Soe dan Idhan, 16 Desember 2009 nanti.Hok-gie bukan hanya tajam menulis kritik terbuka, dia juga mampu menulis puisi alam sehalus kabut Mandalawangi. Juga pilihan puisi dan lirik-lirik lagu, menunjukkan selera kepedulian Hok-gie terhadap seni budaya manusia universal tanpa batasan.Kesetaraan, kepedulian dan kemajemukan merupakan garis besar dan haluan utama segala tulisan di media massa dengan nama: Soe Hok-gie.",,,Paperback,,512 pages,"

","This stunning debut novel—drawn from the author's own life experience—tells the moving story of a family of eleven in the American Midwest, bound together and torn apart by their faith The Rovaniemis and their nine children belong to a deeply traditional church (no drinking, no dancing, no TV) in modern-day Michigan. A normal family in many ways, the Rovaniemis struggle with sibling rivalry, parental expectations, and forming their own unique identities in such a large family. But when two of the children venture from the faith, the family fragments and a haunting question emerges: Do we believe for ourselves, or for each other? Each chapter is told from the distinctive point of view of a different Rovaniemi, drawing a nuanced, kaleidoscopic portrait of this unconventional family. The children who reject the church learn that freedom comes at the almost unbearable price of their close family ties, and those who stay struggle daily with the challenges of resisting the temptations of modern culture. With precision and potent detail, We Sinners follows each character on their journey of doubt, self-knowledge, acceptance, and, ultimately, survival.",0805095330,9780805095333),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

A commander on both land and sea, he led his armies to victory after victory.But like the heroes in a great Greek tragedy, he was a victim of his own pride, arrogance, excess, and ambition. Accused of crimes against the state, he was banished from his beloved Athens, only to take up arms in the service of his former enemies.For nearly three decades, Greece burned with war and Alcibiades helped bring victories to both sides — and ended up trusted by neither.Narrated from death row by Alcibiades’ bodyguard and assassin, a man whose own love and loathing for his former commander mirrors the mixed emotions felt by all Athens, Tides of War tells an epic saga of an extraordinary century, a war that changed history, and a complex leader who seduced a nation.",0553381393,9780553381399),Paperback,,448 pages,"

In the wake of a disastrous love affair with her older, married archaeology professor at Stanford, brilliant Wilhelmina Cooper arrives back at the doorstep of her hippie mother-turned-born-again-Christian's house in Templeton, NY, a storybook town her ancestors founded that sits on the shores of Lake Glimmerglass. Upon her arrival, a prehistoric monster surfaces in the lake bringing a feeding frenzy to the quiet town, and Willie learns she has a mystery father her mother kept secret Willie's entire life.The beautiful, broody Willie is told that the key to her biological father's identity lies somewhere in her family's history, so she buries herself in the research of her twisted family tree and finds more than she bargained for as a chorus of voices from the town's past--some sinister, all fascinating--rise up around her to tell their side of the story. In the end, dark secrets come to light, past and present day are blurred, and old mysteries are finally put to rest.The Monsters of Templeton is a fresh, virtuoso performance that has placed Lauren Groff among the best writers of today.",1401322255,9781401322250),Hardcover,,364 pages,"

In The Red Notebook, Auster again explores events from the real world large and small, tragic and comic—that reveal the unpredictable, shifting nature of human experience. A burnt onion pie, a wrong number, a young boy struck by lightning, a man falling off a roof, a scrap of paper discovered in a Paris hotel room—all these form the context for a singular kind of ars poetica, a literary manifesto without theory, cast in the irreducible forms of pure story telling.",0811214982,9780811214988),Paperback,,104 pages,"

","THE MISUNDERSTOOD GOD tells the truth about who the Creator is. This book analyzes what religion says about God's heart and personality and measures it up to what God calls Himself: Love. It simplifies a generation's tangled perceptions of God by taking a journey through the sixteen aspects of love described in one of the most well-known Bible passages in the world: 1 Corinthians 13, also known as ""the love chapter."" So many Christians have been bombarded with confusing teachings and doctrines that their understanding of God resembles a tightly tangled ball of Christmas tree lights. This book takes that twisted mess and replaces it with one soft, warm light of truth that anyone can embrace: God is love.",1935170090,9781935170099),ebook,,0 pages,"

","The nineteenth century was a period of continuous change for women's clothing in England. The growing prosperity of the merchant class meant an ever-larger number of women for whom ""dress"" was a principal function in life, while the increasing availability of lower-priced ready-made garments enabled women of moderate means to purchase the fashions of the day. In addition, the development of the railways spurred the spread of new goods, while the removal of the tax on papers in 1854 produced an abundance of fashion magazines at cheap prices, bringing news of the latest styles to the multitudes.The magnificent array of ladies' fashions that characterized the century are on display in this remarkably complete decade-by-decade overview. Drawing almost exclusively on contemporary sources — fashion magazines, newspapers, rare period photographs, memoirs, Victorian novels, periodicals, and other publications, as well as firsthand observation of actual garments — the author describes and explains the couture that evolved in response to changing social conditions, technological innovations, and cultural developments.Over 1,100 line and tone drawings and photographs depict hundreds of outfits ranging from lovely morning dresses and starkly attractive riding outfits to elegant carriage costumes, opulent evening dresses, and exquisite bridal gowns. Full-page plates also depict period millinery, footwear, underclothing, and other apparel, while three useful glossaries provide descriptions of materials, definitions of technical terms, and more.Museum curators, vintage clothes collectors, and fashion historians will find this carefully researched and well-written book an indispensable tool for dating, identifying, and authenticating vintage clothing. Not only are styles described and illustrated in detail for each year; all the small details of construction by which specimens can be dated are given wherever possible. Moreover, designers, illustrators, and fashion enthusiasts will be delighted by the superbly detailed illustrations, which painstakingly document the fashionable finery of the Victorian era.",0486263231,9780486263236),Paperback,,576 pages,"

The only thing she cannot conquer is the plague, which marches across the land killing thousands, including the man she loves.Based on a real character, this colorful story is told with sharp humor and is filled with dramatic intensity.

","The women pilots profiled in this book have flown from British Columbia to Newfoundland and in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. Right from the beginning of her interviews and research, the author found herself constantly amazed by the achievements of the women involved. Within the book are the stories of early Canadian women bush pilots from the late 1940s onwards. Their stories are exciting, occasionally funny, and always absorbing. Ranging from aerial surveys, water bombing of fires, flying fish, canoes and northern dogs, to the operation of a float-plane flying school, these women have left little undone. One pilot, Judy Cameron, was the first Canadian woman to be hired by an airline. Flying north of Superior, Elizabeth Wieben recalls the time that she flew naked. In pilot Suzanne Pettigrew's own words, ""We sure have come a long way and the ride was an awful lot of fun.""",1897045166,9781897045169),Paperback,,200 pages,"

She is bound for Rumania, where tales of vampires are still whispered, to visit an old friend and write the book that will bring her true independence.She arrives at a magnificent, decaying castle in the Carpathians, replete with eccentric inhabitants: the ailing dowager; the troubled steward; her own fearful friend, Cosmina. But all are outstripped in dark glamour by the castle's master, Count Andrei Dragulescu.Bewildering and bewitching in equal measure, the brooding nobleman ignites Theodora's imagination and awakens passions in her that she can neither deny nor conceal. His allure is superlative, his dominion over the superstitious town, absolute--Theodora may simply be one more person under his sway.Before her sojourn is ended--or her novel completed--Theodora will have encountered things as strange and terrible as they are seductive.

Sellest katsumusest algab, sellesse suubub ka Niika-Nganassaani elurännak.   - Autor",,,,,,,[]

","Turgenev's first major prose work is a series of twenty-five Sketches: the observations and anecdotes of the author during his travels through Russia satisfying his passion for hunting. His album is filled with moving insights into the lives of those he acquaints with, peasants and landowners, doctors and bailiffs, neglected wives and bereft mothers each providing a glimpse of love, tragedy, courage and loss, and anticipating Turgenev's great later works such as First Love and Fathers and Sons. His depiction of the cruelty and arrogance of the ruling classes was considered subversive and led to his arrest and confinement to his estate, but these sketches opened the minds of contemporary readers to the plight of the peasantry and were even said to have led Tsar Alexander II to abolish serfdom.",0140445226,9780140445220),Paperback,,403 pages,"

","For thirteen years, Ben Tomlin was an only child. But all that changes when his mother brings home Zan — an eight-day-old chimpanzee. Ben’s father, a renowned behavioral scientist, has uprooted the family to pursue his latest research project: a high-profile experiment to determine whether chimpanzees can acquire advanced language skills. Ben’s parents tell him to treat Zan like a little brother. Ben reluctantly agrees. At least now he’s not the only one his father’s going to scrutinize.It isn’t long before Ben is Zan’s favorite, and Ben starts to see Zan as more than just an experiment. His father disagrees. Soon Ben is forced to make a critical choice between what he is told to believe and what he knows to be true — between obeying his father or protecting his brother from an unimaginable fate.Half Brother isn’t just a story about a boy and a chimp. It’s about the way families are made, the way humanity is judged, the way easy choices become hard ones, and how you can’t always do right by the people and animals you love. In the hands of master storyteller Kenneth Oppel, it’s a novel you won’t soon forget.",1441871497,9781441871497),Audio CD,,375 pages,"

"," Two of the most beloved novels in all of English literature-together in one extraordinary volume. A TALE OF TWO CITIES  After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of the two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of the guillotine.GREAT EXPECTATIONS  A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor- these form a series of events that changes the orphaned Pip's life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman. Dickens's haunting late novel depicts Pip's education and development through adversity as he discovers the true nature of his ""great expectations.""This deluxe paperback edition features  *French flaps  *rough-cut high-quality paper  *complimentary front- and back-cover designs highlighting each novel and including foil and debossing",0142196584,9780142196588),Paperback,deckle edge,834 pages,"

But as the king's closest advisors scheme and squabble amongst themselves, hopes of resisting the naked ambition of the Norman duke come to rest with just one man: Hereward...To some a brilliant warrior, to others a devil in human form, Hereward is as adept in the art of slaughter as the enemies that gather to claim England's throne.

","Our most commonly held formula for success is broken. Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, then we’ll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness fuels success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe.             In The Happiness Advantage, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work.             Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines:      • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network  A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, The Happiness Advantage isn’t only about how to become happier at work. It’s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.From the Hardcover edition.",0307591565,9780307591562),ebook,,272 pages,"

","Crime lives--and dies--in the deceptively picture-perfect town of Port Gamble (aka “Empty Coffin”), Washington. Evil lurks and strange things happen--and 15-year-olds Hayley and Taylor Ryan secretly use their wits and their telepathic “twin-sense” to uncover the truth about the town's victims and culprits.  Envy, the series debut, involves the mysterious death of the twins' old friend, Katelyn. Was it murder? Suicide? An accident? Hayley and Taylor are determined to find out--and as they investigate, they stumble upon a dark truth that is far more disturbing than they ever could have imagined. ",1402789572,9781402789571),Hardcover,,285 pages,"

","Zanoni,  first published in 1842, was inspired by a dream. Sir Edward, a Rosicrucian, wrote this engaging, well-researched, novel about the eternal conflict between head and heart, between wisdom and love, played out by the Rosicrucians before the dramatic background of the French Revolution. He described his book Zanoni as ""a truth for those who can comprehend it, and an extravagance for those who cannot."" Following his introduction, the novel is divided into seven parts, whose titles indicate the sevenfold path of spiritual development. The fourth section, ""The Dweller of the Threshold,"" is the book's centerpiece, revealing significant esoteric facts and experiences.A novelist, a dramatist, a scholar, an editor, and an active member of Parliament, Sir Edward was an extremely successful author whose writings were widely read throughout England and Europe. He poured into this esoteric work all of the ancient esoteric wisdom that he felt he could reveal to the public during an age buried deeply in materialism.This work remains one of the great, pioneering landmarks of esoteric writing.",0833400177,9780833400178),Paperback,,462 pages,"

","Эта книга — о возникновении и разрушении далайна — мира, который создал Творец, старик Тэнгэр, уставший от вековой борьбы с многоруким порождением бездны Ёроол-Гуем, ненавидящим все живое. Он решил сотворить мир специально для Многорукого — просто для того, чтоб тот не мешал ему думать о вечном. В этом мире, созданном по меркам дьявола и для обитания дьявола, человек, созданный по образу и подобию Божьему, изначально дьяволу в жертву обречен. Но по воле Тэнгэра раз в поколение в далайне рождается человек, который в силах изменить его так, что в нем не будет места самому Многорукому. Никому это не удавалось, пока не появился Шооран…Роман Святослава Логинова «Многорукий бог далайна» интересен прежде всего тем, что созданный писателем-фантастом мир логичен от начала и до конца. Логичен настолько, что существование невообразимого Ёроол-Гуя от первой до последней страницы не вызывает недоумения, а весь быт этого искореженного мира, мытарства его жителей, фантастические похождения главного героя творца-илбэча — все это накрепко удерживает внимание читателей.",5871980775,9785871980774),Paperback,,381 pages,"

","In Session, from international best seller M.J. Rose, features the return of Dr. Morgan Snow, in a brand-new story collection!As a therapist specializing in sexual issues, psychiatrist Dr. Morgan Snow isn't easily shocked or shaken, as readers and listeners of the popular ""Butterfield Institute"" novels know. There are times, however, when the need for her services leads her out of the office... and into unfamiliar worlds.In these stories, the therapist matches her wits - and her training - against three men of mystery: Jack Reacher, John Rain, and Cotton Malone. These characters are, of course, familiar to listeners as the creations, respectively, of New York Times best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry. All three swore that their characters would never agree to therapy - unless Rose found a way to get them there. And she did.In ""Extenuating Circumstances"" with Steve Berry's Cotton Malone, a woman seeks help for her lover, and sends Dr. Snow overseas on a most unusual house call.In ""Decisions, Decisions"", Barry Eisler's John Rain forces Dr. Snow out of her own comfort zone, and into the world of a former patient's worst nightmare.And in ""Knowing You're Alive"", with Lee Child's Jack Reacher, there are revelations for both the injured Dr. Snow and her unexpected savior/patient.Note that this book uses the actual narrators from each character's respective series (Phil Gigante/Natalie Ross: Dr. Morgan Snow; Scott Brick: Cotton Malone; Barry Eisler: John Rain; Dick Hill Jack Reacher).All the proceeds of the audiobook and a share of the proceeds of the ebook will be donated to David Baldacci's Wish You Well Foundation, supporting family literacy. (wishyouwellfoundation.org/)These characters are the creations, respectively, of New York Times best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry, and are used with their full knowledge and participation.BONUS AUDIO: Audible interviews author M.J.

With her parents away and her alcoholic and newly single brother, Luke, camped in her spare bedroom, Jodie feels like she’s drowning in a world she doesn’t understand. The only thing she can count on is the leopard who has apparently taken it upon himself to protect her. She cannot ignore the raw emotion he awakens in her, and she longs for more.

What’s more, he has a second job the human population doesn’t know about—the one that leads him to Jodie and Luke. Archer feels an instant connection with Jodie, and he must find a way to balance his volatile lifestyle to include her. Luke Fletcher became an alcoholic long before his wife left him. Now he faces the brutal reality that his past has caught up with him. He made a series of bad choices while under the influence, and these choices have placed him, his sister, and his two young daughters in danger.

Cornelius von Baerle, a respectable tulip-grower, lives only to cultivate the elusive black tulip and win a magnificent prize for its creation. But after his powerful godfather is assassinated, the unwitting Cornelius becomes caught up in deadly political intrigue and is falsely accused of high treason by a bitter rival. Condemned to life imprisonment, his only comfort is Rosa, the jailer's beautiful daughter, and together they concoct a plan to grow the black tulip in secret. Dumas' last major historical novel is a tale of romantic love, jealousy and obsession, interweaving historical events surrounding the brutal murders of two Dutch statesman in 1672 with the phenomenon of tulipomania that gripped seventeenth-century Holland.",0140448926,9780140448924),Paperback,,246 pages,"

Schumacher’s riveting, richly researched statement on sustainability has become more relevant and vital with each year since its initial groundbreaking publication during the 1973 energy crisis. A landmark statement against “bigger is better” industrialism, Schumacher’s Small Is Beautiful paved the way for twenty-first century books on environmentalism and economics, like Jeffrey Sachs’s The End of Poverty, Paul Hawken’s Natural Capitalism, Mohammad Yunis’s Banker to the Poor, and Bill McKibben’s Deep Economy.

","​The Making Of AJAY- Every Man-RELOADEDA Time Will Reveal novel[From Back Cover] What qualifies a male to be seen as a man comes from how he’s viewed through the eyes of those in his world. Who that man is stems from how he’s reared as a boy. The lessons he’s taught and the knowledge he takes from those lessons, as a boy child, will manifest as he grows and becomes the man that his world sees. Thus, how valuable those boyhood teachings are to him will translate to others by the way he lives his life. AJAY learned about his legacy as a boy from his father, his grandfather and the males in his crew. He learned to love his woman unconditionally because that is what he saw and valued from those forefathers. He also learned how he was expected to carry out that legacy. He’s a man now and he has done well with his own life. He’s lived up to his expectations and then some. But he’s a father now and the most important part of those lessons he grew from, have to now be passed on to his male seed. This title gives you AJAY Jackson: The man, The husband and The father, giving the legacy he grew from over to his only son, Lil AJAY. AJAY’s main responsibility is to make sure that his son grows up to be a stronger man than he has become, which means his toughest job is before him. He has a junior who is just as head strong and stern but with even less patience for dishonesty. Lil AJAY already shows that he’s honest, loyal and committed to the family’s creed. The reader will learn of AJAY’s early life through his weekly talks with his son. Witness how Lil AJAY gets to know how his father became the person whom he views as simply, “The Man.” Lil AJAY is already curious about how his pops learned to love his mother Ebony the way he’s witnessed him doing during his 6 years of life. This novel shows you how the man we know as AJAY was made and how through Lil AJAY that Every Man legacy will continue.

She's pretty, rich, and popular, and her spot on the homecoming court is practically guaranteed. But when a night of partying ends in an it-could-have-been-so-much worse crash, everything changes. Her best friends start ignoring her, her boyfriend grows cold and distant, and her once-adoring younger sister now views her with contempt. The only bright spot is her creative writing class, led by a charismatic new teacher who encourages students to be true to themselves. But who is Paige, if not the homecoming princess everyone expects her to be?

","As she examines the many misconceptions about the ""Middle Ages"", the renown French historian, RTgine Pernoud, gives the reader a refreshingly original perspective on many subjects, both historical (from the Inquisition and witchcraft trials to a comparison of Gothic and Renaissance creative inspiration) as well as eminently modern (from law and the place of women in society to the importance of history and tradition). Here are fascinating insights, based on Pernoud's sound knowledge and extensive experience as an archivist at the French National Archives. The book will be provocative for the general readers as well as a helpful resource for teachers.Scorned for centuries, although lauded by the Romantics, these thousand years of history have most often been concealed behind the dark clouds of ignorance: Why, didn't godiche (clumsy, oafish) come from gothique (Gothic)? Doesn't fuedal refer to the most hopeless obscurantism? Isn't Medieval applied to dust-covered, outmoded things?Here the old varnish is stripped away and a thousand years of history finally emerge—the ""Middle Ages"" are dead, long live the Middle Ages!",0898707811,9780898707816),Paperback,,179 pages,"

And both had been looking forward to starting middle school together in the fall. But just when Cady and Nana were anticipating being teenagers, their plans spin away from them. At the age of twelve, Nana is diagnosed with bone cancer, and suddenly the present is so much more important than the future.        With refreshing honesty, Sally Warner helps brush aside the mysticism of dying and replaces it with the courage of friendship. Comforting and profoundly moving, Sort of Forever is, by turns, a sincere, funny, painful, and uplifting view of dying, as well as a celebration of life.  ",037580207X,9780375802072),Paperback,,136 pages,"

Je považován za předchůdce prokletých básníků a jeho poezie, ač poplatná středověké, přináší už mnohé moderní prvky. Narodil se roku 1431 a zemřel někdy po roce 1463, neznámo s určitostí kde a kdy.Vyprávění Jarmily Loukotkové na nás dýchne atmosféru středověké Francie, především Paříže, ale hlavně nás nechává nahlédnout do srdce muže, jenž sice zemřel mladý, ale bohatý zkušenostmi a zážitky jako málokdo; muže, který prožil za pět let, co stovky lidí nepotká celý život. V jeho duši se mísí dobro se zlem, láska a nenávist, hledání Boha a zatracování, radost pozemského života s marností světa. Na své životní pouti poznává krásu i ošklivost, věznice i paláce, pařížské podsvětí i pařížskou smetánku, krčmy i nevěstince, ale také hlubokou vášnivou lásku ke Kateřině, která je nevědomou příčinou jeho věčného putování.",8090178316,8090178316,Hardback,,581 pages,"

","Elizabeth Strout ""animates the ordinary with an astonishing force,"" wrote The New Yorker on the publication of her Pulitzer Prize–winning Olive Kitteridge. The San Francisco Chronicle praised Strout's ""magnificent gift for humanizing characters."" Now the acclaimed author returns with a stunning novel as powerful and moving as any work in contemporary literature.Haunted by the freak accident that killed their father when they were children, Jim and Bob Burgess escaped from their Maine hometown of Shirley Falls for New York City as soon as they possibly could. Jim, a sleek, successful corporate lawyer, has belittled his bighearted brother their whole lives, and Bob, a Legal Aid attorney who idolizes Jim, has always taken it in stride. But their long-standing dynamic is upended when their sister, Susan—the Burgess sibling who stayed behind—urgently calls them home. Her lonely teenage son, Zach, has gotten himself into a world of trouble, and Susan desperately needs their help. And so the Burgess brothers return to the landscape of their childhood, where the long-buried tensions that have shaped and shadowed their relationship begin to surface in unexpected ways that will change them forever. With a rare combination of brilliant storytelling, exquisite prose, and remarkable insight into character, Elizabeth Strout has brought to life two deeply human protagonists whose struggles and triumphs will resonate with readers long after they turn the final page. Tender, tough-minded, loving, and deeply illuminating about the ties that bind us to family and home, The Burgess Boys is Elizabeth Strout's newest and perhaps most astonishing work of literary art.",1400067685,9781400067688),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Don Carlos and Mary Stuart, two of German literature's greatest historical dramas, deal with the timeless issues of power, freedom, and justice. Dating from 1787 and 1800 respectively, one play was written immediately before the French Revolution, the other in its aftermath. These new translations into blank verse are accurate, elegant, and playable. The Introduction, Notes, and Chronology set the plays in their cultural and intellectual background, while a family tree explains the historical relationship between Don Carlos and Mary Stuart.

When her cheating spouse topples Sadie’s impeccably tidy world, she packs up her kids for a summer vacation at her aunt’s lake house, hoping to relax, reboot, and formulate a new plan — one that does not include men. Any men. But eccentric Aunt Dody has other plans; she’s determined to see Sadie have a little fun—with Desmond, the sexy new neighbor. Tall, tanned, muscular—and even great with her kids, Desmond is Sadie’s worst nightmare. He must have a flaw—he’s a man, after all—so Sadie vows to keep her distance. But as summer blazes on, their attraction ignites, and the life Sadie is trying so hard to simplify only gets more complicated. But maybe a little chaos is just what she needs to get her future, and her dreams of love, back in order.",,,Kindle Edition,,341 pages,"

","Writers have been writing about war since the siege of Troy, but few, if any, have captured the first-person experience of war as deeply as My Vietnam War. Set in 1967 (the deadliest year of the Vietnam War), this memoir-style novel depicts the psychological journey of a young man whose carefree days of studying philosophy at the university are ended by the draft. The story follows him from his initial rear-echelon assignment in Saigon, where he falls for a mysterious storytelling bar girl, to his eventual posting at an isolated front-line firebase in one of the deepest parts of the Vietnam jungle. While recovering from a leg wound (he is hit by a piece of bone from a fellow soldier who stepped on a booby trap mine), he becomes the assistant medic and sees the horrors of war close up. The experience begins his steady spiral down into PTSD. After he is seriously wounded, he ends up back in Saigon where, after an old friend from Arizona gets him involved in the underground drug trade, the mysterious bar girl may be his only hope for salvation. It is a powerful story, well-written, with vivid detail that you will never forget.",,,Paperback,,327 pages,"

And her profile has only risen since the election ended in favor of the other guy. What makes Meghan so appealing? As a new role model for young, creative, and vocal members of the GOP, she's unafraid to mix it up and speak her mind. In Dirty Sexy Politics she takes a hard look at the future of her party. She doesn't shy away from serious issues and her raucous humor and down-to-earth style keep her positions accessible.

And it was all your fault.A searing and sinister thriller for readers who liked Gone Girl.What if your best friend's child disappears? And it was all your fault. This is exactly what happens to Lisa Kallisto, overwhelmed working mother of three, one freezing December in the English Lake District. She takes her eye off the ball for just a moment and her whole world descends into the stuff of nightmares. Because, not only is thirteen-year-old Lucinda missing, and not only is it all Lisa's fault, but she's the second teenage girl to disappear within this small tightknit community over two weeks. The first girl turned up stripped bare, dumped on a busy high street, after suffering from a terrifying ordeal. Wracked with guilt over her mistake and after being publicly blamed by Lucinda's family, Lisa sets out to right the wrong. But as she begins peeling away the layers surrounding Lucinda's disappearance, Lisa learns that the small, posh, quiet town she lives in isn't what she thought it was, and her friends may not be who they appear, either.",0385680074,9780385680073),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","The fifth book from bestselling author and specialist foster carer Casey Watson.A recent census shows that there are at least 175,000 child carers in the UK, 13,000 of whom care for more than 50 hours a week. Many remain invisible to a system that would otherwise help them. Abigail is one of those children. This is her story.Ten-year-old Abigail has never known her father. Her mother, Sarah, has multiple sclerosis, and Abigail has been her carer since she was a toddler – shopping, cooking, cleaning and attending to her personal needs. When Sarah is rushed to hospital, suddenly this comes to the attention of the social services, and Abigail has nowhere to go.Though she doesn’t fit the usual profile of a child that specialist foster carers Casey and Mike Watson would take on, they are happy to step in and look after Abigail. It’s an emergency, after all – and all that’s needed is a loving temporary home, while social services look into how to support the family so that they can be reunited.But it soon becomes clear that this isn’t going to happen. Sarah’s MS is now at a very advanced stage, and the doctors are certain that there will no longer be periods of remission. Abigail’s emotional state starts to spiral out of control as she struggles to let go of the burden of responsibilities she has carried for so long.Sarah and Abigail insist that they do not need help, but with no other family to contact, social services are left with no choice but to find long-term care for Abigail, against their wishes. But Casey never gives up on a child in need, and she knows there must be another solution…",000747959X,9780007479597),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Inspired by the award-winning film of the same name.If you were told that a murderer was to be released into your neighborhood, how would you feel? But what if it weren’t only one, but thousands?Could there be a common roadmap to reconciliation? Could there be a shared future after unthinkable evil? If forgiveness is possible after the slaughter of nearly a million in a hundred days in Rwanda, then today, more than ever, we owe it to humanity to explore how one country is addressing perceptual, social-psychological, and spiritual dimensions to achieve a more lasting peace. If forgiveness is possible after genocide, then perhaps there is hope for the comparably smaller rifts that plague our relationships, our communities, and our nation. Based on personal interviews and thorough research, As We Forgive returns to the boundary lines of genocide’s wounds and traces the route of reconciliation in the lives of Rwandans—victims, widows, orphans, and perpetrators—whose past and future intersect. We find in these stories how suffering, memory, and identity set up roadblocks to forgiveness, while mediation, truth-telling, restitution, and interdependence create bridges to healing. As We Forgive explores the pain, the mystery, and the hope through seven compelling stories of those who have made this journey toward reconciliation. The result is a narrative that breathes with humanity and is as haunting as it is hopeful.",0310287308,9780310287308),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Siobhan Ashdown was born of magic; it rides her blood like a phantom, tainted and dark and unpredictable. She is a warlock, and the power within her is unlike any before known to her kind. So it’s no surprise that the most powerful of the demons who feed off of this warlock magic not only recognizes the enormous potential she represents but determines that he will possess her at any cost.Even if it means war with the entire supernatural world.Thanatos has ruled Purgatory as the Phantom King since time immemorial. King of a vast plane of solitude, he is a free spirit, a lone rider, a tattooed man of wind and dust and nonexistent boundaries. Then he turns around one morning to find himself face to face with Siobhan Ashdown, a woman with hair as red and wild as his soul, eyes like melted gold, and a spirit as elusive as his own. Time stops, the world tilts, and the fact that she attacks him right off the bat does little to deter his romantic convictions.Thirteen Kings are severed by lust and greed, an ancient vampire and his rogue creation lay claim to what is not theirs, the whisperings of war begin to shake the foundation of the supernatural world, and primordial evil awakens from its slumber to slither across the land in this second installment in the Big Bad Wolf spinoff series, The Kings, by Heather Killough-Walden.",,,Kindle Edition,,204 pages,"

","On Christmas night of 1998, Maria Meyers learns that her twenty-year-old daughter, Pearl, has chained herself outside the American embassy in Dublin, where she intends to starve herself to death. Although Maria was once a student radical and still proudly lives by her beliefs, gentle, book-loving Pearl has never been interested in politics–nor in the Catholicism her mother rejected years before. What, then, is driving her to martyr herself? Shaken by this mystery, Maria and her childhood friend (and Pearl’s surrogate father), Joseph Kasperman, both rush to Pearl’s side. As Mary Gordon tells the story of the bonds among them, she takes us deep into the labyrinths of maternal love, religious faith, and Ireland’s tragic history. Pearl is a grand and emotionally daring novel of ideas, told with the tension of a thriller.",1400078075,9781400078073),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","In Japan, they say there’s a red thread of fate that binds people who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place, or circumstance. It may tangle, it may knot, it may stretch or fray, but it will never break. It is a future as indelible as the past.I hope that isn't true. I pity anyone destined to meet me.----For Bianca Ray, the past is always catching up, one way or another. Now in her third semester at college, it's doing it again. Too much drinking has led to plummeting grades and rising absences, putting her scholarships in peril. When she makes it clear that she needs help—all over the floor of her history class—she’s given one last chance to shape up: seek therapy and bring her grades up by the end of the semester, or she’s out.Enter Catholic seminarian Daniel McGuire. The last thing Bianca wants is an aspiring priest to counsel her on how to live her life, but the handsome graduate student is different from the holy rollers she fled from at home. Gentle and unobtrusive, he helps her pick up the pieces and find a new way to live: not running from the past, but facing it head on. But opening up her heart to release the pain means that something else can come in. As Bianca and Daniel grow closer, their relationship moves onto dangerous ground and the fragile courage Bianca has built up threatens to fail her. Can she exorcise the ghosts of her past, or will they catch hold and drag her down where not even Daniel can reach her?",,,Kindle Edition,,336 pages,"

","Perhaps you can recall a time when you felt more alive than at any other moment--when you had a sudden recognition of beauty, a feeling of deep contentment, and a sense of connection with life greater than you had ever thought possible. And then, this fleeting moment was gone. What if you could recapture that remarkable opening, and make it a consistent way of living in the world?Course objectives: Practice using your inner body as an anchor to the ""Now""--realizing the gift of full attention, and cultivating moments of pure awareness through the simple act of noticing.- Discuss the authentic grace, original innocence, the liberation of laughter, and nature as a bridge to the divine--available to us all.- Define ""awakening"", discover how to dissolve your pain-body with the light of consciousness and why creativity and healing can come only from presence.- Explain why ""the teacher"" is always within you and how to enter the ""Now"" through the portal called ""allow.""- Describe how to find peace that underlies loss.- Summarize how to catch your reactive thoughts before they catch you, and how to expand the space between your thoughts for a deeper experience of the ""Now.""Throughout Europe and North America, a man named Eckhart Tolle has emerged as a teacher with the unique ability to draw us into the awakened state he calls presence. With Realizing the Power of Now: An In-Depth Retreat with Eckhart Tolle, you have an unparalleled opportunity to immerse yourself in the timeless dimension--a place within us that always is and ever will be beyond the turmoil of life, a world of calm beyond words, of joy that has no opposite.Return to Presence Again and AgainA walk in nature. A personal crisis. A moment of laughter. These can all serve as portals that take us to the depth and wonder of the Now. But how do we access these portals so that we dwell in presence more and more often? With Tolle's guidance, you will discover many simple ways to leave behind the chaos and suffering of the mind-made world, and enter this state of serenity and grace.On Realizing the Power of Now, Eckhart will show you how to go beyond the endless stream of thoughts, and simply allow whatever is happening to occur; how to use sense perceptions and your inner body to find a peace that exists independent of conditions; and how to see past the ""little me"" and my story, and find your home in the living Now.An Extended Retreat with Eckhart TolleSince the spiritual transformation that changed his life more than 20 years ago, Eckhart Tolle has replaced the park bench where he gave his first lessons with a chair and microphone, and now helps countless men and women from all walks of life to perceive what it really means to be alive.Recorded at a momentous five-day retreat led by Eckhart Tolle, here is a special invitation to transcend the finite world of fluctuating thoughts, ambitions, and fears, and touch your true essence: that which has no form, no time, and no name. Spoken simply, with his hallmark warmth, humor, and compassion, here is Eckhart's full presentation of a beautiful way to live that arises through Realizing the Power of Now.Realizing the Power of Now highlights: Using your inner body as an anchor to the Now- The gift of full attention- Cultivating moments of pure awareness- The power in the simple act of noticing- Authentic grace and the original innocence we all possess- The liberation of laughter- How to expand the space between your thoughts for a deeper experience of the Now- Nature as a bridge to the divine- Why the teacher is always within you- Reactive thoughts how to catch them before they catch you- Definition of awakening- Entering the Now through the portal called ""allow""- Why creativity and healing can come only from presence- Dissolving your pain-body with the light of consciousness- How to find the peace that underlies loss- Separating your life situation from your life- More than seven hours of personal guidance with the author of The Power of Now",1591790719,9781591790716),Audio CD,,6 pages,"

","In her stunning first novel Amy and Isabelle, Elizabeth Strout evokes a teenager's alienation from her distant mother—and a parent's rage at the discovery of her daughter's sexual secrets. In most ways, Isabelle and Amy are like any mother and her 16-year-old daughter, a fierce mix of love and loathing exchanged in their every glance. And eating, sleeping, and working side by side in the gossip-ridden mill town of Shirley Falls doesn't help matters. But when Amy is discovered behind the steamed-up windows of a car with her math teacher, the vast and icy distance between mother and daughter becomes unbridgeable.As news of the scandal reaches every ear, it is Isabelle who suffers from the harsh judgment of Shirley Falls, intensifying her shame about her own secret past. And as Amy seeks comfort elsewhere, she discovers the fragility of human happiness through other dramas, from the horror of a missing child to the trials of Fat Bev, the community peacemaker. Witty and often profound, Amy and Isabelle confirms Elizabeth Strout as a powerful new talent.",0375705198,9780375705199),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Acclaimed novelist Luanne Rice ""touches the deepest, most tender corners of the heart"" (Tami Hoag, author of A Thin Dark Line). Her stories remind us how precious and fragile life can be—and that we must risk our hearts every day to know happiness. Follow the Stars Home is just such a novel: a story of poignancy and heartbreak, grace and courage.Being a good mother is never simple: each day brings new choices and challenges. For Dianne Robbins, being a devoted single mother has resulted in her greatest joy and her darkest hours. Weeks before her daughter was born, she and her husband, Tim McIntosh, received the news every parent fears. Tim had not reckoned on their child being anything less than perfect, and abruptly fled to a solitary existence on the sea, leaving Dianne with a newborn—almost alone.It was Tim's brother, Alan, the town pediatrician, who stood by Dianne and her exceptional daughter. Throughout years of waiting, watching, and caring, Alan hid his love for his brother's wife. But one of the many hard choices Dianne has made is to close her heart toward any man—especially one named McIntosh. It will take a very special twelve-year-old to remind them all that love comes in many forms and can be received with as much grace as it is given.As lyrical and moving as the poetry of nature, Follow the Stars Home is a miracle of storytelling that will take your breath away. If words alone can dare us to confront our fears and to choose joy over sorrow, then Luanne Rice's magnificent novel is a benediction and a call to celebrate our lives.",0553581023,9780553581027),Paperback,,462 pages,"

Hilarious and beautifully produced, this is a visual feast which will delight and entertain Noel's many impassioned fans.""Growing up in the jungles of India there was no need for drawing or painting. I would sometimes arrange ants into primitive still lives or scratch out portraits onto the trunks of trees. Things changed when I was 11, a lame tiger who owned a stationery shop gave me the keys to his stock room, I would roll around in acrylic and oil pastels in reverie, licking canvases and tucking coloured pencils into my wild hair. It was here I learned how to draw and paint well enough to be accepted into Croyden Art College.

","The literature of darkness holds a haunting immediacy for most readers. The life of man, after all, is but a brief interval between one darkness and another, while the world he inhabits is likewise merely an ephemeral flicker within a universe enshrouded by perpetual night. As each finite being runs its course, then afterward comes the dark.Basil Copper has explored this grimly somber realm of human reality with a sensitivity and skill that is almost unparalleled among the fantasy writers of our age. All seven tales in AND AFTERWARD, THE DARK treat the subject of death, but in each instance this common theme has been magically transmuted through the incomparable alchemy of Copper's marvelous macabre imagination.Contents:""Introduction"", by Edward Wagenknecht""The Spider""""The Cave""""Dust to Dust""""Camera Obscura""""The Janissaries of Emilion""""Archives of the Dead""""The Flabby Men""",0870540793,9780870540790),Hardcover,,222 pages,"

","Seven years ago, Christian Wiman, a well-known poet and the editor of Poetry magazine, wrote a now-famous essay about having faith in the face of death. My Bright Abyss, composed in the difficult years since and completed in the wake of a bone marrow transplant, is a moving meditation on what a viable contemporary faith—responsive not only to modern thought and science but also to religious tradition—might look like.Joyful, sorrowful, and beautifully written, My Bright Abyss is destined to become a spiritual classic, useful not only to believers but to anyone whose experience of life and art seems at times to overbrim its boundaries. How do we answer this “burn of being”? Wiman asks. What might it mean for our lives—and for our deaths—if we acknowledge the “insistent, persistent ghost” that some of us call God?",0374216789,9780374216788),Hardcover,,182 pages,"

","Pensava che la morte fosse la fine — poi l’amore la riportò alla vita.  Juniper Lee potrebbe concedersi ogni lusso. Potrebbe viaggiare senza preoccuparsi di avere una destinazione, abbandonarsi a ogni sorta di eccesso senza temere ripercussioni. Ma non c’è nessun bene materiale che possa distrarla dalla solitudine che la divora, perché Juniper è un spettro intrappolato in una dimensione dai contorni indefiniti. . Il suo cuore non batte realmente, e tutto di lei - i suoi respiri, i suoi sorrisi, le lacrime che spesso le solcano le guance, sono solo l’eco di una vita ormai lontana. Juniper è sola e non possiede alcun ricordo. L’unica memoria che sollecita la sua mente, sin da quando si è risvegliata nella sua nuova forma spettrale, è quella di un nome. Il suo. Unica eredità della ragazza che doveva essere stata un tempo. Eppure, nonostante sembri non esserci nulla a legarla al mondo dei vivi, Juniper non riesce a seguire il raggio di luce che potrebbe aprirle le porte dell’aldilà.  Quando alla sua porta si presenta Logan, attraente ragazzo dallo sguardo scintillante, tutto per lei si tinge di nuovi e abbaglianti colori. Logan è diverso dagli altri spettri, è come se in sé nascondesse qualcosa di unico, che l’attrae in modo irresistibile. Qualcosa di inspiegabile avviene quando i due si toccano, come l’esplosione di una forza celestiale. E un ingranaggio si smuove nei recessi della mente di lei, facendole provare sensazioni mai conosciute prima. Sensazioni che profumano di ricordi sopiti e verità dimenticate. Sensazioni che potrebbero rispondere alla domanda che l’ha assillata sin dal giorno del suo risveglio: chi è davvero Juniper Lee?",,,Kindle Edition,Lain,164 pages,"

","From the age of three, the very people who were meant to be looking after and protecting Sarah Forsyth were sexually abusing her. Somehow she managed to overcome the hurt and heartbreak of a horrific childhood, and build a new and happy life for herself as a nursery nurse. Then, one day, Sarah spotted a newspaper advert for a job in a creche in Amsterdam. Thrilled by the prospect of a fresh start away from Newcastle and all the memories it held, she eagerly signed up. But within minutes of arriving in Amsterdam her life began to fall apart. There was no creche and no job: Sarah was a victim of sex-trafficking. Fed cocaine and cannabis, and forced at gunpoint to work as a prostitute in the red light district of Amsterdam, Sarah was turned from a young innocent English girl into a desperate and terrified crack whore. Riddled with fear about what her pimps would do to her if they caught her trying to run away, it took Sarah almost a year to find the strength to fight back and escape. But, unlike many of the girls that she was forced to live and work beside, she did get away. Sarah Forsyth is a survivor. This is her heartbreaking story.",1844546853,9781844546855),Paperback,,252 pages,"

But he's encountered one problem: The migraines are going to continue to get worse unless you make some major changes in your lifestyle. What you need is a 'sea change'… Perhaps buy a nice little business in the country, settle down, something easier to occupy your time… While John knows the doctor is right, he just can't resign from the job he's fought so hard for.

John expects to put in his year, get his stress under control, and then get back to business. What John doesn't expect is how Margins and its denizens draw him in, particularly the quiet, disheveled man who takes refuge in the old leather chair in the second-hand book section.

","One of the seminal works of Western philosophy, Aristotle's Rhetoric vastly influenced all subsequent thought on the subject — philosophical, political, and literary. Focusing on the use of language as both a vehicle and a tool to shape persuasive argument, Aristotle delineates with remarkable insight both practical and aesthetic elements and their proper combination in an effective presentation, oral or written. He also emphasizes the role of language in achieving precision and clarity of thought.The ancients regarded rhetoric as the crowning intellectual discipline — the synthesis of logical principles and other knowledge attained from years of schooling. Modern readers will find considerable relevance in Aristotelian rhetoric and its focus on developing persuasive tools of argumentation. Aristotle's examinations of how to compose and interpret speeches offer significant insights into the language and style of contemporary communications, from advertisements to news reports and other media.",8804407492,9788804407492),Paperback,Large print,397 pages,"

","A riveting crime thriller set during a sultry Barcelona summer, introducing Inspector Hector SalgadoInspector Hector Salgado is a transplanted Argentine living in Barcelona. While working on human trafficking case, Salgado’s violent temper got the best of him and he beat a suspect within an inch of his life.  Ordered on probation, he fled to Argentina to cool off for a few months.        Now he’s back in Barcelona and is eager for another big case.  But his boss has other plans.  He assigns Salgado to a routine accidental death: a college student fell from a balcony in one of Barcelona’s ritzier neighborhoods.  As Salgado begins to piece together the life and world of the victim, he realizes that his death was not all that simple: his teenage friends are either overly paranoid or deceptively calm, and drugs might be involved.  Hector begins to follow a trail that will lead him deep into the underbelly of Barcelona’s high society where he’ll come face-to-face with dangerous criminals, long-buried secrets, and, of course, his own past.  But Hector thrives on pressure, and he lives for this kind of case—dark, violent, and seemingly unsolvable.        Gripping, sophisticated, and wickedly entertaining, The Summer of Dead Toys introduces a charismatic new detective and announces Antonio Hill as a new master of the crime thriller.",,,Kindle Edition,,369 pages,"

","After his big-shot life in New York tragically falls apart, James Montgomery returns to his small hometown in south Georgia a defeated and broken man. All he has left is his mother to help him heal and regain his confidence before he's ready to get back out and re-conquer the world.But being big-city gay in a small southern town has its own challenges. In addition to coming to grips with what happened in New York, his hometown of Lawder throws its own curveballs at him. James is confronted with a bitter enemy from his school days, and frustratingly can't seem to avoid the guy. His mother suddenly wants to expand the family. The one guy James takes a liking to and starts dating has a lot of hang-ups about being gay. And he watches almost helplessly as a new young bully starts to repeat the kind of abuse he suffered during his own school days.Here where he grew up, the one place he should feel safe, James feels maddeningly off-balance. He starts to think that maybe going home was a bad idea after all. Maybe he'd be better off moving on and really starting over, completely from scratch. Maybe he should walk away from Lawder, just like he walked away from his life in New York.But maybe, if he'd give it a chance, he'd re-think everything he ever thought he wanted out of life. And maybe what he thought was important, isn't so important after all. Maybe he could have everything he never realized he wanted, if he just looked around himself for a moment.",,,Kindle Edition,,424 pages,"

","Romeo and Juliet never had to worry about being skinned alive.Sydney Skeller’s father is spitting bullets over her reluctance to join the family business as a shifter hunter. The last thing Daddy needs to know is why—she yearns for a lover who’s man enough for a relationship but animal enough to give her the wild ride of her dreams. After a treadmill mishap lands her in a tangled heap with Jason Cannon, she wonders if she’s finally found her beast, er, man. One session in bed and one bite later, she’s sure. Now if only she can keep her father from mounting Jason’s head on a wall…Jason is all man on the surface, but wolf shifter down to the bone. He’s more than ready to stop “playing the pack” and find his one true mate, and Sydney of the luscious curves is the woman of his dreams. Finding out that she comes from a family sworn to eradicate his kind isn’t a deal-breaker. But her outrageous plan for him to masquerade as the wolf in hunter’s clothing, right under her father’s very nose, could be asking more than he ever expected to give.Warning: Readers, be aware of stranger side effects. These side effects may include but aren’t limited to the following: biting strangers, asking furry strangers to bite you, purposely falling off treadmills to collide with handsome strangers, enjoying hot sex with wild strangers, and baying at the moon to meet other moon-influenced strangers.

With the Destiny Sword destroyed, and the fate of the Ring in the balance, Argon and Alistair will need to summon their magical powers to help Gwendolyn’s brave warriors.

Beautiful, golden-haired Maggie Macdrumin is determined to help liberate her fellow Scotsmen, but upon arriving in London, she's arrested and brought to court, falsely accused of stealing a man's purse. In a bid to save herself, she impulsively lays claim to a family connection with well-known Edward Carsley, the powerful Earl of Rothwell--and her family's worst enemy.

","Sheila Kay Adams brings us a novel inspired by the ballads of the English, Scottish, and Irish. These long, sad stories of heartbreak and betrayal, violence and love, have been sung for generations by the descendents of those who settled the Appalachian mountains in the 1700s. As they raised their children, they taught them first to sing, for the songs told the children everything they needed to know about life. So it was with the Stanton family living in Marshall, North Carolina, during the 1800s. Even Larkin Stanton, just a baby when his parents die and he's taken in by his cousin Arty, starts humming before he starts talking. As he grows up, he hungrily learns every song he can, and goes head-to-head with his cousin Hackley for the best voice, and, of course, the best attentions of the women. It's not long before the two boys find themselves pursuing the affections of the same lovely girl, Mary, who eventually chooses Hackley for her husband. But, just as in the most tragic ballads, there is no stowing away of emotions. And when Hackley leaves his wife under his cousin's care in the midst of the Civil War, Larkin finds himself drawn back to the woman who's held his heart for years. What he does about that love defies all his learning of family and loyalty and reminds us that those mournful ballads didn't just come from the imagination, but from the imperfections of the heart.",1565124073,9781565124073),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Like the tentacles of an octopus, the tracks of the railroad reached out across California, as if to grasp everything of value in the state Based on an actual, bloody dispute between wheat farmers and the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1880, The Octopus is a stunning novel of the waning days of the frontier West. To the tough-minded and self-reliant farmers, the monopolistic, land-grabbing railroad represented everything they despised: consolidation, organization, conformity. But Norris idealizes no one in this epic depiction of the volatile situation, for the farmers themselves ruthlessly exploited the land, and in their hunger for larger holdings they resorted to the same tactics used by the railroad: subversion, coercion and outright violence. In his introduction, Kevin Starr discusses Norris's debt to Zola for the novel's extraordinary sweep, scale and abundance of characters and details.",,,Paperback,,688 pages,"

","‘Status of Women in Islam’ answers some of the frequently asked questions regarding Muslim Women e.g. rights of women according to Shariah, their share of inheritance and education, right to own property, right to work etc. In Islam women have the right to be educated, nurtured and cared for. It is first book of the “Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence Concerning Muslim Women” series written by Yusuf Al-Hajj Ahmad. This series addresses those matters of life and religion that are essential in facilitating a woman’s role as a mother, teacher and nurturer. It has two very important and distinct qualities: 1.	Easy to read, succinct and direct. 2.	The 'question and answer' layout of the book is intended to facilitate effortless comprehensibility and swift memorization. It is in view of the 'questions and answers' format that the author has concluded this book to be easy to read and comprehensive, hoping that it will enable the Muslims to be well informed about matters concerning their religion which will in turn strengthen their faith.",,,ebook,,29 pages,"

","Naomi Novik’s beloved series returns, with Captain Will Laurence and his fighting dragon Temeraire once again taking to the air against the broadsides of Napoleon’s forces and the friendly—and sometimes not-so-friendly—fire of British soldiers and politicians who continue to suspect them of divided loyalties, if not outright treason.     For Laurence and Temeraire, put out to pasture in Australia, it seems their part in the war has come to an end just when they are needed most. But perhaps they are no longer alone in this opinion. Newly allied with the powerful African empire of the Tswana, the French have occupied Spain and brought revolution and bloodshed to Brazil, threatening Britain’s last desperate hope to defeat Napoleon.   And now the government that sidelined them has decided they have the best chance at negotiating a peace with the angry Tswana, who have besieged the Portuguese royal family in Rio—and thus offer to reinstate Laurence to his former rank and seniority as a captain in the Aerial Corps. Temeraire is delighted by this sudden reversal of fortune, but Laurence is by no means sanguine, knowing from experience that personal honor and duty to one’s country do not always run on parallel tracks.   Nonetheless, the pair embark for Brazil, only to meet with a string of unmitigated disasters that force them to make an unexpected landing in the hostile territory of the Incan empire, where they face new unanticipated dangers.   Now with the success of the mission balanced on a razor’s edge, and failure looking more likely by the minute, the unexpected arrival of an old enemy will tip the scales toward ruin. Yet even in the midst of disaster, opportunity may lurk—for one bold enough to grasp it.",0345522869,9780345522863),Hardcover,Del Rey,325 pages,"

Unhappy with her life as it was and unwilling to become what her mother and sister envision, she retreats to the little Appalachian town of Prestons Mill, the place where her father was raised. Meg has promised herself six months away from the influences of home to find out who she is and what she really wants out of life.Her Great Aunt Annie doesn’t hold with such nonsense, but she does believe that good food, hard work and fresh country air have the power to heal the soul and she sees in Meg a soul that belongs to the mountain.Coming from wealth and privilege, Meg isn’t sure at first what to make of a place where much of your wardrobe comes from Gorton’s Farm Supply and the only coffee available is what’s brewed at the Downtown Café. However, it doesn’t take long for her to become attached to the people of Prestons Mill with their blunt honesty and strange speech or to reluctantly fall for the boy who kissed her under the apple tree when she was only ten. He’s grown into an intriguing man with problems of his own.JT Preston is burdened with his family’s past sins, sins that prevent him from seeking the life he’s always envied and longed for. Annie thinks this is nonsense, too, and sets about bringing Meg and JT together, but nothing is ever as easy as it sounds.When a coal company makes plans to begin mining the mountain, Meg and JT find themselves in the middle of the battle between those who consider it progress and those who see it as the end of a way of life.

","In Dark Lycan, Christine Feehan journeyed into the heart of the Carpathians, and into the souls of two lifemates stirred by the flush of passion and the threat of annihilation. In Dark Wolf, the breathtaking story continues as the bonds of family are imperiled, and the fate of two lovers lies hidden in the seductive shadows between life and death.Skyler Daratrazanoff always recognized the miracle that was Dimitri Tirunul, a man beyond any dream that had ever engaged her nights. But she was human. Vulnerable. He was Carpathian. Nearly immortal. She was nineteen. He was an ancient. Yet she held half his soul, the light to his darkness. Without her, he would not survive. Caught between the two warring species, Dimitri has spent centuries hunting the undead to keep his people free, and humans safe. He had survived honorably when others had chosen to give up their souls. But now, marked for extermination by the Lycans, Dimitri found himself alone, and fearing for his life. But salvation was coming…No Lycan would ever suspect someone like Skyler to dare mount a secret rescue operation. A teenage girl. A human of untested abilities. But she had something no one else had. She was predestined for Dimitri—as he was for her. And there was nothing stronger for Skyler than her desire to see her life-dream come true.

","Franny Chapman just wants some peace. But that's hard to get when her best friend is feuding with her, her sister has disappeared, and her uncle is fighting an old war in his head. Her saintly younger brother is no help, and the cute boy across the street only complicates things. Worst of all, everyone is walking around just waiting for a bomb to fall. It's 1962, and it seems that the whole country is living in fear. When President Kennedy goes on television to say that Russia is sending nuclear missiles to Cuba, it only gets worse. Franny doesn't know how to deal with what's going on in the world -- no more than she knows how to deal with what's going on with her family and friends. But somehow she's got to make it through.

","Expanding the scope of her storytelling as never before, ""New York Times"" bestselling author Joy Fielding delivers the novel that will captivate her devoted fans and win her countless new readers: an exquisitely tender and richly textured love story of astonishing emotional force.  Behind the shiny facade of her seemingly idyllic life in Chicago, Mattie Hart feels as if she is falling apart. After sixteen years of marriage, and one beautiful teenage daughter, Mattie has discovered that her husband, Jake, a high-profile defense attorney, is ensconced in yet another love affair.  It is only after Jake finally confesses his infidelity and leaves to live with his girlfriend that a far greater crisis descends upon the embattled Hart family -- Mattie receives some devastating news that will alter all their lives. Wracked by guilt at these unforeseen developments, Jake returns home to be with Mattie. Here, in this most daunting and unexpected of circumstances, Joy Fielding deftly ushers her characters through a poignant and heartbreaking drama about love's astonishing power to defy the greatest odds and to heal the deepest wounds.  Bearing all the distinctive qualities of a contemporary classic, ""The First Time"" is a dazzling illumination of a marriage at the crossroads, where the ties that bind become frayed but refuse to sever, and where a long estranged husband and wife discover, for the first time, exactly what love really means. At once profoundly cathartic and inspiring, ""The First Time"" finds Joy Fielding at the height of her powers as she explores the amazing resilience of the human spirit.",0743467140,9780743467148),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Within the English revolution of the mid-17th century which resulted in the triumph of the protestant ethic--the ideology of the propertied class--there threatened another, quite different, revolution. Its success ""might have established communal property, a far wider democracy in political and legal institutions, might have disestablished the state church and rejected the protestant ethic."" In The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill studies the beliefs of such radical groups as the Diggers, the Ranters, the Levellers and others, and the social and emotional impulses that gave rise to them. The relations between rich and poor classes, the part played by wandering 'masterless men,' the outbursts of sexual freedom and deliberate blasphemy, the great imaginative creations of Milton and Bunyan - these and many other elements build up into a marvellously detailed and coherent portrait of this strange, sudden effusion of revolutionary beliefs. It is a portrait not of the bourgeois revolution that actually took place, but of the impulse towards a far more fundamental overturning of society.""Incorporates some of Dr. Hill's most profound statements yet about the 17th-century revolution as a whole."" -- The Economist",0140137327,9780140137323),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Synopsis:  THE JOURNEY CONTINUES ...  With the aid of the druids of Sparak Th'ur, Garat and his companions traverse the mountains of the west, along the river of exiled souls to arrive in the Eastlands.  They escaped the wrath of the Cannatii, even as the Cannatii leader, Baylsson, rails in anger at the escape of the young priest and the creation of the great rift in his lands. A great yawning chasm, torn in the ground by the power of the mountains of the west, cuts him off from half the northern continent. He orders his minions on the eastern side of the rift to find and kill the fleeing priest.  Meanwhile, the druids of Sparak Th'ur set Garat's party on their designated paths to persuade the people of the Eastlands of the danger posed by the Cannatii, and to unite the Eastlands Barons into an army to oppose any barbarians who cross the mountains.  The inspiration for The Waking of Carag Cri'eth, the first volume of The Thoughts of Mountains series, began with a view of the mountains of Slovakia. This is the second book of the series.

She’s certain this year will be exactly like every other. She'll go unnoticed in the shadow of her older brother, Ryan, because he and his two best friends, Todd and Brian, are juniors as well as stars on the varsity football team. Everyone knows and loves them, while she is only a freshman; a nobody. Ashley has known both of her brother’s best friends her entire life, however, she's never really noticed Todd's clear, blue eyes and perfectly messy hair until now.

As she navigates her own, difficult feelings, Ashley learns that she's not the only one keeping secrets, and if these other secrets get out, they could destroy friendships... maybe even lives.",,,Kindle Edition,,237 pages,"

Karena itu Mamz memutuskan mencarikan Datuk Maringgi abad modern untukku.  “Kenapa, sih, gue jadi nggak normal cuma gara-gara gue belom kawin?!”  “Karena elo punya kantong rahim, Darling,” jawab Dina kalem. “Kantong rahim sama kayak susu Ultra. Mereka punya expired date.” “Yeah,” sahutku sinis. “Sementara sperma kayak wine. Masih berlaku untuk jangka waktu yang lama.” Mamz pikir aku belum menikah karena nasibku yang buruk. Dan kalau beliau tidak segera bertindak, maka nasibku akan semakin memburuk. Tapi Mamz lupa bertanya apa alasanku hingga belum tergerak untuk melangkah ke arah sana.  Alasanku simple. Karena Mamz dan Papz bukan pasangan Huxtable. Mungkin jauh di dalam hatinya, mereka menyesali keputusannya untuk menikah. Atau paling tidak, menyesali pilihannya. Seperti Dina, sahabatku. “Kenapa sih elo bisa kawin sama laki?!”  Dina tergelak mendengarnya. “Hormon, Darling! Kadang-kadang kerja hormon kayak telegram. Salah ketik waktu ngirim sinyal ke otak.

","An extraordinary story about the adventure of faith and the power of persevering prayer… On a summer's day in 1727 a community of Moravians started praying and didn't stop for more than 100 years. Throughout history God has mobilised such movements and moments of 24/7 prayer - from the Upper Room of Pentecost to Azusa Street in Los Angeles, through ancient Celtic saints and extraordinary characters like Alexander the Sleepless. This is the story of a movement of the Spirit in our time, a move as ancient as it is modern. As young people desert the church and AIDS orphans Africa, a new generation is learning to pray and obey like never before. From Communist China to Washington DC and from the ranks of the Salvation Army to anarchic German punks, the 24-7 Prayer movement has been interceding continually, night and day, since 1999 in more than fifty countries. This is their extraordinary story; an honest account of pain and perseverance alongside pioneering mission and miraculous answers to prayer.",0972927662,9780972927666),Paperback,,196 pages,"

The shock of the murder ripples throughout the great city, from the most renowned artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, to a wealthy wool merchant and his extraordinarily beautiful daughter, Madonna Lisa.More than a decade later, Florence falls under the dark spell of the preacher Savonarola, a fanatic who burns paintings and books as easily as he sends men to their deaths.

Drawn into a netherworld of rituals and celebrations, Davis penetrated the vodoun mystique deeply enough to place zombification in its proper context within vodoun culture. In the course of his investigation, Davis came to realize that the story of vodoun is the history of Haiti—from the African origins of its people to the successful Haitian independence movement, down to the present day, where vodoun culture is, in effect, the government of Haiti’s countryside. The Serpent and the Rainbow combines anthropological investigation with a remarkable personal adventure to illuminate and finally explain a phenomenon that has long fascinated Americans.",0684839296,9780684839295),Paperback,,304 pages,"

She wants to find the right guy, not the usual jerk her school has to offer. She wants a good reputation, because she believes that will lead to good things.  But life is messy, and it's very hard to be in control of it. Not when there are freshman girls running around in a pack, trying to get senior guys to sleep with them. Not when your friends have secrets they're no longer comfortable sharing. Not when the boy you once dismissed ends up being the boy you want to sleep with yourself - but only in secret, with nobody ever finding out.  Slut or saint? Winner or loser? Natalie is getting tired of these forced choices - and is now going to find a way to live life in the sometimes messy, sometimes wonderful in-between.

","The works of the Buddha can feel vast, and it is sometimes difficult for even longtime students to know where to look, especially since the Buddha never explicitly defined the framework behind his teachings. Designed to provide just such a framework, In the Buddha's Words is an anthology of the Buddha's works that has been specifically compiled by a celebrated scholar and translator. For easy reference, the book is arrayed in ten thematic sections ranging from ""The Human Condition"" to ""Mastering the Mind"" to ""The Planes of Realization."" Each section comes with introductions, notes, and essays to help beginners and experts alike draw greater meaning from the Buddha's words. The book also features a general introduction by the author that fully lays out how and why he has arranged the Buddha's teachings in this volume. This thoughtful compilation is a valuable resource for both teachers and those who want to read the Buddha on their own.",0861714911,9780861714919),Paperback,,486 pages,"

And Joe's been picked to temporarily run Jensen's Teton district.Jackson, Wyoming, is a far cry from Joe's hometown of Saddlestring-it's the epicenter for many environmental extremists and an elite playground for the rich and powerful-and Joe quickly finds himself in over his head.

","Watch out Alexander McCall Smith! Here comes the first novel by the highly acclaimed writer Tarquin Hall in an entrancing new mystery series set in India.The portly Vish Puri is India’s most accomplished detective, at least in his own estimation, and is also the hero of an irresistible new mystery series set in hot, dusty Delhi. Puri’s detective skills are old-fashioned in a Sherlock Holmesian way and a little out of sync with the tempo of the modern city, but Puri is clever and his methods work. The Case of the Missing Servant shows Puri (“Chubby” to his friends) and his wonderfully nicknamed employees (among them, Handbrake, Flush, and Handcream) hired for two investigations. The first is into the background of a man surprisingly willing to wed a woman her father considers unmarriageable, and the second is into the disappearance six months earlier of a servant to a prominent Punjabi lawyer, a young woman known only as Mary.The Most Private Investigator novels offer a delicious combination of ingenious stories, brilliant writing, sharp wit, and a vivid, unsentimental picture of contemporary India. And from the first to the last page run an affectionate humour and intelligent insights into both the subtleties of Indian culture and the mysteries of human behaviour.",0771038259,9780771038259),Hardcover,,311 pages,"

It's no wonder the G-men turn to Jake when they need someone to go after a suspected killer who’s been knocking off banks in a magic-enhanced crime spree. Problems arise when Jake discovers the bad girl behind the robberies is an old friend, and he happens to know her magic is just as powerful as his, and the Feds have  plunged Jake into a secret battle between powerful cartels of magic-users--a cartel whose ruthless leaders have decided that Jake is far too dangerous to live. . . .    ",,,Audiobook,"Audible, Unabridged",,"

","As the western world’s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden has fought to keep his personal life a mystery – loyalty and fear keeping those who know him from speaking out – until now.For the first time, two of Osama’s closest family members, his first wife Najwa and their fourth son Omar, go behind the headlines to reveal the truth about the character and life of a man feared and revered around the globe. In gripping detail, they recount the drama, tensions, and everyday activities of the man they knew as a husband and father. Married at fifteen, Najwa describes the transformation of the quiet, serious young man she fell in love with into an authoritarian husband and stern father, an entrepreneur, and – finally – the leader of a complex international terrorist network. Uprooted from a life of extraordinary luxury and privilege in Saudi Arabia, they suddenly found themselves living life on the run, fleeing from country to country under assumed names and fake passports. Omar describes how he and his siblings were brought up in remote ranches and fortified Afghani mountain camps, handling Kalashnikovs and learning desert survival skills. Their eventual escape from Afghanistan would come just days before the terrible events of 9/11 changed the world forever. With unprecedented access and exclusive family photographs, Jean Sasson, author of the bestselling Princess, presents the story that we were never meant to hear.",185168901X,9781851689019),Paperback,,421 pages,"

","WINNER of the 2014 RBC Taylor PrizeThe Inconvenient Indian is at once a “history” and the complete subversion of a history—in short, a critical and personal meditation that the remarkable Thomas King has conducted over the past 50 years about what it means to be “Indian” in North America.Rich with dark and light, pain and magic, this book distills the insights gleaned from that meditation, weaving the curiously circular tale of the relationship between non-Natives and Natives in the centuries since the two first encountered each other. In the process, King refashions old stories about historical events and figures, takes a sideways look at film and pop culture, relates his own complex experiences with activism, and articulates a deep and revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands.This is a book both timeless and timely, burnished with anger but tempered by wit, and ultimately a hard-won offering of hope—a sometimes inconvenient, but nonetheless indispensable account for all of us, Indian and non-Indian alike, seeking to understand how we might tell a new story for the future.From the Hardcover edition.",0385674058,9780385674058),ebook,,266 pages,"

","With his family caught in the crosshairs of a group of brutal killers, detective Cork O’Connor must solve the murder of a young girl in the latest installment of William Kent Krueger’s unforgettable New York Times bestselling series. During a houseboat vacation on the remote Lake of the Woods, a violent gale sweeps through unexpectedly, stranding Cork and his daughter, Jenny, on a devastated island where the wind has ushered in a force far darker and more deadly than any storm. Amid the wreckage, Cork and Jenny discover an old trapper’s cabin where they find the body of a teenage girl. She wasn’t killed by the storm, however; she’d been bound and tortured before she died. Whimpering sounds coming from outside the cabin lead them to a tangle of branches toppled by the vicious winds. Underneath the debris, they find a baby boy, hungry and dehydrated, but still very much alive. Powerful forces intent on securing the child pursue them to the isolated Northwest Angle, where it’s impossible to tell who among the residents is in league with the devil. Cork understands that to save his family he must solve the puzzle of this mysterious child whom death follows like a shadow. “Part adventure, part mystery, and all knockout thriller” (Booklist ), Northwest Angle is a dynamic addition to William Kent Krueger’s critically acclaimed, award-winning series.",1439153957,9781439153956),Hardcover,,357 pages,"

","A long time ago, the year was 1014. It was one of the holiest times of the year and a battle was being fought. It was the Battle of Clontarf. There, the armies of the High King, Brian Boru of Ireland fought against Mael Morda Mac Muchada, Sigtrygg Silkbeard and Brian’s ex wife Gormflaith. Many fell including the High King, most of his sons, grandsons and Mael Morda. Fighting along side Mael were his nephews, younger brothers of Sigtrygg. One was Olaf the younger who would be reborn that day as Odin. He knew then he would not take a wife or mate until the right one came. So he would wait… The year is 2010 and Odin Mac Muchada is assigned to watch the daughter of future Queen of their kind. Her name is Sally MacNamara . Odin knew from the moment he laid eyes on her, that she was his… he would wait another two years to tell her, “I’ve been Waiting for You.” Here is the explosive sequel to “One Thousand Years to Forever” The twist, and turns will leave you breathless.",,,ebook,Smashwords,,"

","From Adriane Leigh comes a passionately evocative story about wanting what's forbidden and giving in to desire so sharp and sweet it threatens to consume...Georgia Montgomery lives in an ever-present state of denial. It's the only coping mechanism she's found to overcome the horror that colors her past. Until one pleasure-seeking playboy turns her world on its axis. Georgia tries to ignore the tornado of emotion that sweeps through her system whenever Tristan is near, but just like an addiction, one look, one taste, one touch is never enough. And then there's Kyle, the doting boyfriend she's left at home for the summer, the one she gave her heart to when she was twelve, the one that holds her fragile love in his strong and steady hands. What was once comfortable turns unbearable, and soon Georgia finds herself fantasizing about the forbidden. The chemistry between Tristan and Georgia is scorching and it isn't long before the slow burn ignites into a full-blown wildfire that threatens to consume anything in its path. Denial is comfortable. Love is anything but. For mature audiences.",,,Kindle Edition,,304 pages,"

","Shaykh Saalih Ibn Saalih al-Fawzaan clarifies the issues related to Jihaad. He begins by establishing its place in the history of mankind. He then explains the wisdom behind its legislation, its linguistic and religious meanings, and the different rulings and regulations pertaining to its performance.Shaykh ‘Abdul-Azeez Aalish-Shaykh praises Shaykh Fawzaan’s clarification of this oft-misunderstood issue:“Saalih has spoken in this place about the types of Jihaad, the rules of each type, what is necessary for the Muslim concerning this matter, what the obligatory Jihaad is, and what the non-obligatory Jihaad is. He also answered the questioners’ questions with legitimate answers that contain insight for he who desires clear-sightedness [tabassur] [regarding this issue].”Also included in the Appendices are clarifications from Shaykh Fawzaan and Imaam al-Albaanee that the terrorism perpetrated today by so-called jihaad groups is far removed from the jihaad sanctioned by Allaah ('azza wa jal) and his Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). That these groups are not influenced by the Noble Qur’an and the Sunnah of the Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) but by deviated ideologies foreign to Islam.",,,ebook,,,"

","Pragmatism has been called America's only major contribution to philosophy. But since its birth was announced a century ago in 1898 by William James, pragmatism has played a vital role in almost every area of American intellectual and cultural life, inspiring judges, educators, politicians, poets, and social prophets.Now the major texts of American pragmatism, from William James and John Dewey to Richard Rorty and Cornel West, have been brought together and reprinted unabridged. From the first generation of pragmatists, including the Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes and the founder of semiotics, Charles Sanders Peirce, to the leading figures in the contemporary pragmatist revival, including the philosopher Hilary Putnam, the jurist Richard Posner, and the literary critic Richard Poirier, all the contributors to this volume are remarkable for the wit and vigor of their prose and the mind-clearing force of their ideas. Edited and with an Introduction by Louis Menand, Pragmatism: A Reader will provide both the general reader and the student of American culture with excitement and pleasure.",0679775447,9780679775447),Paperback,,560 pages,"

","The idiosyncratic, erudite and brilliantly funny new book from Mark Forsyth, bestselling author of The Etymologicon and The Horologicon.In an age unhealthily obsessed with substance, this is a book on the importance of pure style.From classic poetry to pop lyrics and from the King James Bible to advertising slogans, Mark Forsyth explains the secrets that make a phrase - such as ‘Tiger, tiger, burning bright’ or ‘To be or not to be’ - memorable.In his inimitably entertaining and witty style he takes apart famous lines and shows how you too can write like Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde. Whether you’re aiming for literary immortality or just an unforgettable one-liner, The Elements of Eloquence proves that you don't need to have anything to say - you simply need to say it well.",1848316216,9781848316218),Hardcover,,205 pages,"

","Seventeen year-old spirit medium Emily Chambers has a problem. Actually, she has several. As if seeing dead people isn't a big enough social disadvantage, she also has to contend with an escaped demon and a handsome ghost with a secret past. And then there's the question of her parentage. Being born an entire year after her father's death (yes, a year) and without the pale skin of other respectable English ladies, Emily is as much a mystery as the dead boy assigned to her.Jacob Beaufort's spirit has been unable to crossover since his death several months ago. It might have something to do with the fact he was murdered. Or it might not. All he knows is, he has been assigned by the Otherworld's administrators to a girl named Emily. A girl who can see and touch him. A girl who released a shape-shifting demon into the mortal realm. Together they must send the demon back before it wreaks havoc on London. It should be a simple assignment, but they soon learn there's nothing simple when a live girl and a dead boy fall in love.THE MEDIUM is the first book in the bestselling EMILY CHAMBERS SPIRIT MEDIUM TRILOGY.",,,ebook,,260 pages,"

","Can the love of a lifetime be forever changed by one pink line? Dina Silver's tender, absorbing novel, One Pink Line, is a warmhearted, wry story of love, loss and family, as seen through the prism of one singular, spirited young couple who find themselves in a predicament that changes the course of their lives, and those closest to them. With heart, humor and compassion, this debut work of women's fiction is certain to stir anyone who relishes a good laugh, can stand a good cry, and, above all believes in the redemptive power of love.This unique, contemporary story gives readers a dual perspective. Sydney Shephard, a sweet-tempered, strong-natured college senior is young, in love with an exceptional man, and unexpectedly pregnant. Faced with a child she never planned for, she is forced to relay this news to her neurotic mother, relinquish her youth, and risk losing the love of her life. Then there's Grace, a daughter, who believed she was a product of this great love, grows to realize her existence is not what she assumed, and is left with profound and puzzling questions about who she really is.Spanning generations and every imaginable emotion, One Pink Line reveals how two points of view can be dramatically at odds, and perhaps ultimately reconciled. Simultaneously deeply felt and lighthearted, One Pink Line deftly mines how the choices we make are able to alter so many lives, and how doing the right thing and living honestly can bring unexpected, hard-won happiness. It's a must-read for anyone who craves a great love story, absorbing characters, and plenty of laughs along the way.",,,Kindle Edition,,261 pages,"

","You can change your personal capacity for happiness. Research psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky's pioneering concept of the 40% solution shows you how  Drawing on her own groundbreaking research with thousands of men and women, research psychologist and University of California professor of psychology Sonja Lyubomirsky has pioneered a detailed yet easy-to-follow plan to increase happiness in our day-to-day lives-in the short term and over the long term. The How of Happiness is a different kind of happiness book, one that offers a comprehensive guide to understanding what happiness is, and isn't, and what can be done to bring us all closer to the happy life we envision for ourselves. Using more than a dozen uniquely formulated happiness-increasing strategies, The How of Happiness offers a new and potentially life- changing way to understand our innate potential for joy and happiness as well as our ability to sustain it in our lives.  Beginning with a short diagnostic quiz that helps readers to first quantify and then to understand what she describes as their ""happiness set point,"" Lyubomirsky reveals that this set point determines just 50 percent of happiness while a mere 10 percent can be attributed to differences in life circumstances or situations. This leaves a startling, and startlingly underdeveloped, 40 percent of our capacity for happiness within our power to change.  Lyubomirsky's ""happiness strategies"" introduce readers to the concept of intentional activities, mindful actions that they can use to achieve a happier life. These include exercises in practicing optimism when imagining the future, instruction in how best to savor life's pleasures in the here and now, and a thoroughgoing explanation of the importance of staying active to being happy. Helping readers find the right fit between the goals they set and the activities she suggests, Lyubomirsky also helps readers understand the many obstacles to happiness as well as how to harness individual strengths to overcome them. Always emphasizing how much of our happiness is within our control, Lyubomirsky addresses the ""scientific how"" of her happiness research, demystifying the many myths that unnecessarily complicate its pursuit. Unlike those of many self-help books, all her recommendations are supported by scientific research.  The How of Happiness is both a powerful contribution to the field of positive psychology and a gift to all those who have questioned their own well- being and sought to take their happiness into their own hands.",159420148X,9781594201486),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","The original Hagakure contains the teachings of the samurai-turned-priest Jōchō Yamamoto (1659-1719), and was for generations preserved as moral and practical instructions for daimyo and samurai of Saga Han, a large domain in northwestern Kyushu. It later became known all over Japan, and during the Second World War Jōchō’s precept ‘I found that the Way of the Samurai is death’, became a slogan to spur on Kamikaze pilots. But the Hagakure is not only about death. In this, his adaptation and interpretation of it, Yukio Mishima deals with its teachings on action, subjectivity, strength of character, passion and love, and delights in giving prolific examples of Jōchō’s practical advice from proper behavior at a drinking party to child rearing. In the Hagakure, the most important influence on his life – and his death – Mishima saw striking similarities between his criticisms of materialistic post-war Japan and Jōchō’s criticisms of the sumptuous decadence of his contemporaries; and it is this emphasis which gives it its immediacy.",0465090893,9780465090891),Hardcover,,166 pages,"

","This is the second of two companion anthologies that chronicle the history of the SF adventure story. With this book, editor Gardner Dozois is attempting to disprove the old adage that ""they don't write 'em like that anymore."" Which, of course, they do, as writers like Peter F. Hamilton, Michael Swanwick, George Turner, and John Varley amply demonstrate in these pages. The selections here date from 1977 to 1998, although Dozois has limited himself by omitting subgenres such as cyberpunk, military SF, and even hard SF. While this makes the The Good New Stuff somewhat dubious as a historical overview of the adventure SF field, it allows Dozois to uncover some real gems that might otherwise have gone overlooked, including a couple of stories first published in the Brit-lit SF magazine Interzone. It's safe to say that in the hands of authors like Robert Reed, Walter Jon Williams, and Stephen Baxter, the grand tradition of SF is alive and well. --Craig E.

","There are two periods of history that pertain to missing and endangered children in the United States: before Adam Walsh, and after Adam Walsh. In the aftermath of that six-year old's abduction and slaying in 1981, everything about the nation's regard and response to missing children changed.The shock of the crime and the inability of law enforcement to find Adam's killer put an end to innocence, and altered our very perception of childhood itself - gone forever are the days when young children burst out the doors of American homes with a casual promise to be home by dark. And, due in large part to the efforts of Adam's parents, John and Reve Walsh, the entire mechanism of law enforcement has transformed itself in an effort to protect our children.Before Adam went missing, there were no children's faces on milk cartons and billboards, no Amber Alerts, no national Center for Missing and Abused Children, no national databases for crimes against children, no registration of pedophiles - in fact, it was easier to mobilize the FBI to search for a stolen car or missing horse than for a kidnapped child. Such facts may be sad testimony to the weariness of a modern world, but there is also an uplifting aspect to Adam's story - the 27 years of undaunted effort by decorated Miami Beach Homicide Detective, Joe Matthews, to track down Adam's killer and bring justice to bear at long last.Bringing Adam Home tells the story - the good, the bad, and the ugly - of what it took for one cop to accomplish what an entire system of law enforcement could not. Matthews' achievement is a stirring one, reminding us that such concepts as hard work, dedication, and love, survive, and that goodness can prevail.",006198390X,9780061983900),Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","Dane and Mandy, a popular magic act for forty years, are tragically separated by a car wreck that claims Mandy's life -- or so everyone thinks. Even as Dane mourns and tries to rebuild his life without her, Mandy, supposedly dead, awakes in the present as the nineteen-year-old she was in 1970. Distraught and disoriented in what to her is the future, she is confined to a mental ward until she discovers a magical ability to pass invisibly through time and space to escape. Alone in a strange world, she uses her mysterious powers to eke out a living, performing magic on the streets and in a quaint coffee shop. Hoping to discover an exciting new talent, Dane ventures into the coffee shop and is transfixed by the magic he sees, illusions that even he, a seasoned professional, cannot explain. But more than anything, he is emotionally devastated by this teenager who has never met him, doesn't know him, is certainly not in love with him, but is in every respect identical to the young beauty he first met and married some forty years earlier.They begin a furtive relationship as mentor and protege, but even as Dane tries to sort out who she really is and she tries to understand why she is drawn to him, they are watched by secretive interests who not only possess the answers to Mandy's powers and misplacement in time but also the roguish ability to decide what will become of her.Frank Peretti has crafted a rich, rewarding story of love and life, loss and restoration, full of twists and mystery. Exceptionally well written, Illusion will soon prove another Peretti classic.",1439192677,9781439192672),Hardcover,,498 pages,"

","Master alchemist Addie Daulton hasn’t always done the right thing. To atone for sins from her forgotten past, and earn back the respect of the people she loves, she decides to show the world that alchemy can be used for good. For healing. But she can’t do anything without a lab. Desperate, she teams up with a new partner whose lab has everything she needs, but does she dare work with a man whose reputation is even darker than her own? The risk proves worth it when she lands a contract to make burn salve for a local hospital. Things are looking up until Rowan, the leader of the magical community and her former lover, returns and demands her assistance. The magical are being gunned down, and cryptic messages are being left at the murder scenes. Messages that point a finger at alchemy—and her. The connection begins to make sense when she discovers that the bullets from the crime scenes have been altered with blood alchemy—and that the design is her own. Working with Rowan won’t be easy, not just because of their lost love, but because her new business partner once tried to kill him. If Rowan finds out who he really is, Addie’s involvement in the investigation will be over. She can’t let Rowan shut her out again.

","Why do we make mistakes? Are there certain errors common to failure, whether in a complex enterprise or daily life? In this truly indispensable book, Dietrich Dörner identifies what he calls the “logic of failure”—certain tendencies in our patterns of thought that, while appropriate to an older, simpler world, prove disastrous for the complex world we live in now. Working with imaginative and often hilarious computer simulations, he analyzes the roots of catastrophe, showing city planners in the very act of creating gridlock and disaster, or public health authorities setting the scene for starvation. The Logic of Failure is a compass for intelligent planning and decision-making that can sharpen the skills of managers, policymakers and everyone involved in the daily challenge of getting from point A to point B.",0201479486,9780201479485),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Mirabai is probably the best-known poet in India today, even though she lived 400 years ago (1498-1593). Her poems of ecstatic praise to Krishna, whom she lovingly calls ""The Dark One"", are set to music and sung by schoolchildren, and are frequently heard as background tracks in contemporary films.As alive today as it was in the 16th century, Mirabai's poetry is about freedom, breaking with traditional stereotypes, and trusting completely in the benediction of God. It is also some of the most exalted mystical poetry in all of world literature, expressing her complete surrender to the divine, her longing, and her madness in love.This book is a revised edition of a Shambhala Centaur book that was published in 1994 and sold 10,000 copies in the two years following its release. The new edition contains the original 80 poems, a completely revised introduction, updated glossary, bibliography and discography, and additional Sanskrit notations.",0877738726,9780877738725),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Tobias is a skilled Dom, able to bring even the most hesitant submissive around. Noah is a man in need of just that. He wants to sub badly, but has yet to find someone he believes can take him where he needs to go. Through a series of encounters in the world of bondage and discipline, Noah reveals why he has trouble trusting, why he needs such a firm, steady hand. Tobias may allow himself to dominate, but he has trouble letting himself love. Still, Tobias can't resist Noah's charms, and the two of them set about making a scene for themselves, one that works for them and their unique set of problems. They learn to love, but can they stay together while they explore each others' secrets, in a world where all is laid bare and emotions run high? From authors Chris Owen, writer of the popular ""Bareback"", and Jodi Payne, writer of ""String of Pearls"" comes a romance on the deviant side, where love is all tied up with the need to submit, the need to dominate, and the need to share a life of exploration and care. These two skilled authors create a world that's hard to resist, and a book that's even harder to put down.",,,Kindle Edition,,318 pages,"

An instant hit from his first appearance, Superman's popularity has grown through the decades -- and today he is known worldwide as the defender of Truth, Justice and the American Way.But his earliest stories reveal a Superman who took no prisoners, made his own laws and gleefully delivered his own brand of justice -- even if it meant dangling a crook by the ankle from above the city, or giving a wife-beater a taste of his own medicine. This was a Superman who embodied pure wish fulfillment, with his early adventures showing a raw super-hero in the making -- and the development of an enduring classic!DC Comics is proud to present this definitive and affordable collection of Superman's first stories. Assembled here are his earliest adventures from ACTION COMICS #1-13, NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR COMICS #1 and SUPERMAN #1 -- including all covers.

They set fire to Fred Shoemaker’s toolshed, blackmailed Wanda Pierce to get her charm bracelet, and smacked Alice Wendelken across the head. And that’s just the start! When the Herdmans show up at church for the free snacks and suddenly take over the Christmas pageant, the other kids are shocked. It’s obvious that they’re up to no good. But Christmas magic is all around and the Herdmans, who have never heard the Christmas story before, start to reimagine it in their own way.This year’s pageant is definitely like no other, but maybe that’s exactly what makes it so special.",0064402754,9780064402750),Paperback,,128 pages,"

","Erik Larson, New York Times bestselling author of Devil in the White City, delivers a remarkable story set during Hitler’s rise to power.The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America’s first ambassador to Hitler’s Nazi Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.    A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the “New Germany,” she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance—and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler’s true character and ruthless ambition.    Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.",030740885X,9780307408853),Paperback,,451 pages,"

In May of ‘82, Julio Cortázar, literary explorer of the highest order, set out with Carol Dunlop aboard their VW camper van (a.k.a. Fafner) to explore the uncharted territory of the Paris-Marseilles freeway. It was a route they’d driven before, usually in about ten hours. This time, they loaded up with supplies—food, water, wine, typewriters, cameras—and prepared for an arduous voyage of thirty-three days without leaving the autoroute, at a rate of two rest stops per day. Along the way they would uncover the hidden side of the freeway and take the notion of literature from a serious game to a logical, surreal extreme.",0979333008,9780979333002),Paperback,,354 pages,"

","“Want to be a mage? Then do we have the job for you…”  Sounds great for a veteran role-player. When on-the-job training entails battling demons, learning magic through trial and error, and living in a world without toilet paper, things could get rough. But to be dropped in the middle of a forest and having to do it on your own with no instruction…welcome to James’ world.  It all gets started when his grandfather suggests to James, a young man on the verge of graduating high school, that he check out the following advertisement for a job.  “Magic! Real Magic! Ever wanted to learn? We require someone with intelligence and a disciplined mind. Those well versed in fantasy novels and role playing games a plus. May need to travel.”  Sounded like the perfect job for a veteran role-player and avid fantasy reader. James had no idea he’d be whisked to another world, completely cut off from friends and family. Arriving in a meadow in the middle of a forest, he’s greeted by a creature not entirely human. He was then told three things:  Magic works here… Don’t try to go home… Get to the village of Trendle…  Then the creature vanished.  Which way was Trendle? Where was he? What might inhabit the forest that will seek his ruination? These were but a few of the questions needing to be unraveled.  Alone with only his wits and knowledge gleaned from hundreds of books and dungeon campaigns, he started out just trying to survive. He soon learned that one mistake, one lapse in judgment could mean his death.  Not long after arriving, he made the acquaintance of Miko, a street-wise kid who quickly became his friend and companion. Little did he know that the strength within this child from the streets of Bearn, a strength that would be tested again and again as they waded through battle after battle, delved in hidden passages deep beneath the earth, and faced off against an the might of an Empire, would be invaluable in the trials ahead.  The Unsuspecting Mage is the first book of The Morcyth Saga, a seven book epic fantasy adventure. It follows James as he seeks first to master the art of magic then to uncover the reason why he had been brought to this strange new world where armies are on the move and gods meddle in the affairs of men.

Together, they journey because they have to; because they have nowhere to go, and no one to answer to other than themselves. Traveling the bloody wastelands of this ruined world, Moses is looking for a kernel of truth, and a reason to keep going.

Immediately after the jets struck the twin towers of the World Trade Center, Dennis Smith, a former firefighter, reported to Manhattan’s Ladder Co. 16 to volunteer in the rescue efforts. In the weeks that followed, Smith was present on the front lines, attending to the wounded, sifting through the wreckage, and mourning with New York’s devastated fire and police departments.This is Smith’s vivid account of the rescue efforts by the fire and police departments and emergency medical teams as they rushed to face a disaster that would claim thousands of lives. Smith takes readers inside the minds and lives of the rescuers at Ground Zero as he shares stories about these heroic individuals and the effect their loss had on their families and their companies. “It is,” says Smith, “the real and living history of the worst day in America since Pearl Harbor.” Written with drama and urgency, Report from Ground Zero honors the men and women who—in America’s darkest hours—redefined our understanding of courage.",0452283957,9780452283954),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Overwhelmed is a book about time pressure and modern life. It is a deeply reported and researched, honest and often hilarious journey from feeling that, as one character in the book said, time is like a ""rabid lunatic"" running naked and screaming as your life flies past you, to understanding the historical and cultural roots of the overwhelm, how worrying about all there is to do and the pressure of feeling like we're never have enough time to do it all, or do it well, is ""contaminating"" our experience of time, how time pressure and stress is resculpting our brains and shaping our workplaces, our relationships and squeezing the space that the Greeks said was the point of living a Good Life: that elusive moment of peace called leisure.Author Brigid Schulte, an award-winning journalist for the Washington Post - and harried mother of two - began the journey quite by accident, after a time-use researcher insisted that she, like all American women, had 30 hours of leisure each week. Stunned, she accepted his challenge to keep a time diary and began a journey that would take her from the depths of what she described as the Time Confetti of her days to a conference in Paris with time researchers from around the world, to North Dakota, of all places, where academics are studying the modern love affair with busyness, to Yale, where neuroscientists are finding that feeling overwhelmed is actually shrinking our brains, to exploring new lawsuits uncovering unconscious bias in the workplace, why the US has no real family policy, and where states and cities are filling the federal vacuum.She spent time with mothers drawn to increasingly super intensive parenting standards, and mothers seeking to pull away from it. And she visited the walnut farm of the world's most eminent motherhood researcher, an evolutionary anthropologist, to ask, are mothers just ""naturally"" meant to be the primary parent? The answer will surprise you.Along the way, she was driven by two questions, Why are things the way they are? and, How can they be better? She found real world bright spots of innovative workplaces, couples seeking to shift and share the division of labor at home and work more equitably and traveled to Denmark, the happiest country on earth, where fathers - and mothers - have more pure leisure time than parents in other industrial countries. She devoured research about the science of play, why it's what makes us human, and the feminist leisure research that explains why it's so hard for women to allow themselves to. The answers she found are illuminating, perplexing and ultimately hopeful. The book both outlines the structural and policy changes needed - already underway in small pockets - and mines the latest human performance and motivation science to show the way out of the overwhelm and toward a state that time use researchers call ...

","Cultivating Your Inner Life, the latest book from Pastor Edmund Chan, is an in-depth reflection on the topic of spiritual formation through discipleship.In this book, he shares on how the overemphasis on numerical growth and outward manifestations of the Christian faith has been sapping the vitality of the church and affecting how non-believers perceive Christianity. This is because many Christians do not live lives which reflect their faiths due to misunderstandings about what it really means to live a life of intimacy with God.Using his own life-experiences as examples, Edmund Chan pays special attention to dispelling the myths and obstacles that are hindering the spiritual growth of a Christian and provides the guidance that is needed to overcome them. He also touches upon some pitfalls that many Christian fall into such as serving without joy and shows us what we can do even when we are struggling to understand the will of God. The author used his personal life experiences to illustrate his points on christian growth. One of the book's main topic is intimacy with God. The book discussed several myths that people believe about intimacy with God. Here are the 4 myths:> Intimacy is the key to blessing> Intimacy is a prize> Intimacy with God is optional> Intimacy is experienced the same way by everyoneRev. Edmund Chan stated 4 truths to contradict the 4 myths. The 4 truths are:> God delights in intimacy with us and invited us to it> Intimacy is a God-given birthright for all> Intimacy takes trust and not just time> Intimacy with God results in redemptive acts of love",,,Hardcover,,,"

For Parker Bradley, it’s bloodthirsty sea serpents that slither in his dreams.And for seven essay contestants, it’s their worst nightmares that win them an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at director Justin Blake’s latest, confidential project.

","Les Femmes savantes est une pièce de théâtre en cinq actes et en alexandrins.Ce joyeux classique sait toujours amuser le public Avec sa moquerie de Philamente, une dame pas du tout littéraire qui s'est décidée d'avoir une salon littéraire éclatante. Elle n'a ni sens littéraire, ni sens commun, ce qui fait d'elle une proie facile pour Trissotin, un arnaqueur flagorneur, qui se fait passer pour un célèbre poète et devient une maison d'hôtes permanents. Philamente espère marier sa fille à Trissotin, mais la fille veut épouser Clitandre qui ne répond pas aux normes de sa mère. Dans cette avant-dernière pièce de son illustre carrière, Molière moque l'intellectualisme ""stupide"", l'ascension sociale, et l'apprentissage prétentieux.

","The Midnight Passage debuts the chronicles of Jim Thatcher and the intrepid crew of the sloop Adventure. Pirates, puzzles, and peril await the privateer crew as they seek to recover the vast treasure of Morgan's Lost Gold from the mysterious Aztec underworld of the Midnight Passage. Betrayal! A treaty is signed, and suddenly the British privateers are named pirates by the very Crown they serve. Some embrace the new title and the bloody life that comes with it; others, like Captain Jim Thatcher, are not so eager to turn against the world they love. Exiled from Port Royal, Thatcher and the crew of the Adventure set out on a new mission. They seek to recover a vast fortune in gold and emeralds that disappeared a half-century before, hoping it will be enough to buy their pardons. But Thatcher soon learns that the Adventure is not the only ship on the hunt for the treasure. An Indiaman pursues them across the Windward Passage; it is the Havoc, captained by Thatcher's long-time nemesis, Edward Teach, the infamous Blackbeard. Fleeing the powerful pirate ship and following a questionable treasure map, the crew takes refuge at the mouth of an underground river system, the ancient Aztec underworld. They are trapped by the Havoc; there is nowhere to go but forward, but there are worse things than pirates in the Caribbean. Deadly puzzles, booby traps, and something even more sinister await the crew in the darkness of the Midnight Passage.",1469293137,9781469293134),Audio CD,,,"

","Grak hates things. Lots of things. And with a peculiar intensity too.Grak’s contempt is so strong, in fact, that it often leaves his fellow tribesmen bewildered. And when attempting to describe his personality, they find themselves in need of words with greater nuance. “Neurotic” is typically used. “Sociopath” and “narcissist” are also common terms. The most popular descriptor, however, is “pathological.”Grak, on the other hand, sees his situation in a rather different light. He finds his behavior “necessary” and “selfless,” or even “benevolent” when his mood is just so. Most often, though, he simply attributes his nature to “being human.”But of all the things Grak despises, his antipathy for olives takes precedence. In his efforts to be rid of this nuisance, he gets his first taste of power and ignites a series of events with troubling consequences. Unwilling to give up his newfound influence, he sets about honing his only true talent: manipulation. But as his grip tightens, Grak’s naively selfish exterior crumbles to reveal a dark and malicious evil …In his debut work, author Peter J Story brews a robust psychological satire infused with dry humor and a pinch of emotion. Set just prior to recorded history, Things Grak Hates chronicles the life of a bizarre nomad and his descent toward evil. Along the way, this unconventional and introspective allegory explores a variety of complex issues. Among them: power, politics, religion, redemption, the dissemination of ideas, and human nature itself.",0990749304,9780990749301),Hardcover,,334 pages,"

","Thomas Szasz is renowned for his critical exploration of the literal language of psychiatry and his rejection of officially sanctioned definitions of mental illness. His work has initiated a continuing debate in the psychiatric community whose essence is often misunderstood. Szasz's critique of the established view of mental illness is rooted in an insistent distinction between disease and behavior. In his view, psychiatrists have misapplied the vocabulary of disease as metaphorical figures to denote a range of deviant behaviors from the merely eccentric to the criminal. In A Lexicon of Lunacy, Szasz extends his analysis of psychiatric language to show how its misuse has resulted in a medicalized view of life that denies the reality of free will and responsibility. Szasz documents the extraordinary extent to which modern diagnosis of mental illness is subject to shifting social attitudes and values. He shows how economic, personal, legal, and political factors have come to play an increasingly powerful role in the diagnostic process, with consequences of blurring the distinction between cultural and scientific standards. Broadened definitions of mental illness have had a corrosive effect on the criminal justice system in undercutting traditional conceptions of criminal behavior and have encouraged state-sanctioned coercive interventions that bestow special privileges (and impose special hardships) on persons diagnosed as mentally ill. Lucidly written and powerfully argued, and now available in paperback, this provocative and challenging volume will be of interest to psychologists, criminologists, and sociologists.",1560000651,9781560000655),cloth,,214 pages,"

","Meneer Beerta is het eerste deel van Het Bureau, een roman in zeven delen, die de menselijke verhoudingen op en rondom een wetenschappelijk instituut tussen de jaren 1957 en 1987 tot onderwerp heeft. Hoofdpersoon is Maarten Koning, die ook in Bij nader inzien - het debuut van J.J. Voskuil uit 1963 - centraal stond.Maarten Koning ervaart de maatschappij waarin hij een plaats moet vinden als bedreigend en past zich moeilijk aan. Dat scherpt zijn blik voor zijn eigen tekortkomingen en die van zijn collega’s. In zijn ogen is de wereld waarin zij leven een schijnwereld, waarin mensen hun behoefte aan aandacht, erkenning of macht verbergen achter, schijnbaar zinvolle, maar in werkelijkheid zinloze werkzaamheden. Deze verborgen behoeften van mensen die elkaar niet hebben uitgezocht maar wel dag in dag uit met elkaar moeten verkeren, zijn aanleiding tot talloze wrijvingen en spanningen, een enkele maal met een tragische afloop, maar meestal komisch.Meneer Beerta beschrijft de jaren tussen 1957 en 1965 en eindigt met de pensionering van Beerta als directeur. Maarten heeft hem in zijn studietijd leren kennen als een beminnelijke scepticus en dat trekt hem aan. Van het geïdealiseerde beeld dat hij van hem heeft zal in de loop van het boek weinig overblijven, al verliest hij zijn sympathie niet. Tegelijkertijd is de lezer getuige van zijn vergeefse pogingen bondgenoten te zoeken in zijn afkeer van de in zijn ogen loze pretenties van de mensen waartussen hij terecht is gekomen.",9028209514,9789028209510),Paperback,,779 pages,"

Do universo do romance também fazem parte as lembranças dos cartões de abastecimento, as desigualdades sociais e os conflitos entre modernidade e tradição.Através do olhar lírico de um garoto, o leitor é levado a uma Angola que acabou de se tornar independente e é obrigada a repensar as regras sociais e a questionar as causas da desigualdade. Ondjaki nos conduz aos pequenos acontecimentos do cotidiano que mostram como é preciso mais que um decreto para que as mudanças de fato aconteçam. Assim como em outros livros de Ondjaki, o mundo dos jovens e a descoberta da vida adulta e seus conflitos são retratados sem o tom irritadiço das militâncias nem a condescendência do lirismo excessivo.

","The second volume is packed with intriguing developments, as Schulz continues to create his tender and comic universe. It begins with Peanuts' third full year and a cast of eight: Charlie Brown, Shermy, Patty, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, the recently-born Linus, and Snoopy. By the end of 1954, Pigpen and his dust cloud join the crowd. Linus, who still doesn't speak, begins to emerge as one of the most complex and endearing characters in the strip: garrulous and inquisitive yet gentle and tolerant. And, in this volume, he acquires his security blanket! Charlie Brown is becoming his best-known self, the lovable, perpetually-humiliated round-headed loser, but he hasn't yet abandoned his brasher, prankish behavior from Volume One. And, Lucy, this book's cover girl, has grown up and forcefully elbowed her way to the center of the action, proudly wearing her banner as a troublemaker, or, in Schulz's memorable phrase, a ""fussbudget"". For readers unfamiliar with the early years of the strip, Snoopy's appearances here may come as the biggest surprise: he behaves, for the most part, like a dog! But, although he doesn't yet walk upright, sleep on top of his doghouse, or possess a fantasy life, Snoopy has started thinking for himself and his evolution continues its fascinating course within these pages. If you watch carefully, you'll catch his very first shark impression. The vast majority of the daily and Sunday strips collected here are not currently available in any in-print Peanuts collection. Dozens of them have not been reprinted since their initial appearance in newspapers over 50 years ago.2005 Eisner Award Winner, Best Archival Collection/Project; 2005 Eisner Award Winner, Best Publication Design (Seth).",1560976144,9781560976141),Hardcover,,325 pages,"

War with Norway is on the horizon. And Hamlet - son of the old king, nephew of the new - becomes increasingly entangled in a web of deception - and murder.Struggling to find his place in this strange new order Hamlet tries to rekindle his relationship with Ophelia - the daughter of Elsinore's cunning spy master, a man with plots of his own. Hamlet turns for advice and support to the one person he can trust -- Young Yorick, the slippery, unruly jester, whose father helped Hamlet through a difficult childhood. And all the while the armed forces of Fortinbras, prince of Norway, start to assemble, threatening to bring down Elsinore forever.Beautifully performed by actor Richard Armitage (""Thorin Oakenshield"" in the Hobbit films), Hamlet, Prince of Denmark takes Shakespeare's original into unexpected realms, reinventing a story we thought we knew.",,,Audible Audio,9 hours and 40 minutes,,"

But Bailey hasn't found his kin yet, and without an Animas, he's destined to be an outsider-or worse, lose his mind entirely. So when he's accepted into the prestigious Fairmount Academy, he's determined to Awaken to his Animas once and for all, even if it's a measly worm. But once there, Bailey can't resist the pull of the dark mysteries surrounding the kingdom. A bear has been viciously attacked on school grounds, and when he and his friends discover signs of a ferocious predator in the woods surrounding campus, he knows something's out there, something dangerous. And Fairmount isn't the only place where darkness is brewing. In the capital city, a new leader preaches that humans must assert power over their kin, enslave them instead of living as one.Bailey can't shake the feeling that the root of the unrest, and the key to his Awakening, lies in an old riddle entwined around an even older prophecy-a prophecy that may reveal the truth about the rightful king of Aldermere. And Bailey may be the only one who can unravel them. The capital's dark forces will stop at nothing to prevent the prophecy from coming true. If they succeed, the Animas bond will be in peril. Can Bailey help protect the Animas bond while still trying to awaken to his own? In this first installment of the gripping ANIMAS series, the battle is just beginning.

","Imagine a place where the dead rest on shelves like books.Each body has a story to tell, a life seen in pictures that only Librarians can read. The dead are called Histories, and the vast realm in which they rest is the Archive. Da first brought Mackenzie Bishop here four years ago, when she was twelve years old, frightened but determined to prove herself. Now Da is dead, and Mac has grown into what he once was: a ruthless Keeper, tasked with stopping often-violent Histories from waking up and getting out. Because of her job, she lies to the people she loves, and she knows fear for what it is: a useful tool for staying alive.Being a Keeper isn't just dangerous-it's a constant reminder of those Mac has lost. Da's death was hard enough, but now that her little brother is gone too, Mac starts to wonder about the boundary between living and dying, sleeping and waking. In the Archive, the dead must never be disturbed. And yet, someone is deliberately altering Histories, erasing essential chapters. Unless Mac can piece together what remains, the Archive itself might crumble and fall.In this haunting, richly imagined novel, Victoria Schwab reveals the thin lines between past and present, love and pain, trust and deceit, unbearable loss and hardwon redemption.",142317108X,9781423171089),Paperback,,321 pages,"

","A finales del siglo IV antes de Cristo, Roma se encontraba a punto de ser aniquilada por los ejércitos cartagineses al mando de Aníbal. Ese era su inexorable destino hasta que surgió un solo hombre, un joven oficial de las legiones, que transformó lo que debía ocurrir en lo que finalmente fue: la génesis de un imperio y una civilización secular en el tiempo y en la historia del mundo. Aquel niño recibió el nombre de su progenitor, Publio Cornelio Escipión, quien fuera cónsul de Roma durante el primer año de aquella guerra. Las hazañas del hijo del cónsul alcanzaron tal magnitud que el pueblo le concedió un sobrenombre especial, un apelativo referente a uno de los territorios que conquistó: Africanus. Africanus, el hí]o del cónsul narra con una prosa ágil y directa el.tormentoso y a la vez fascinante mundo de la juventud de Publio Cornelio Escipión, el Africano.

","“The voice of the Divine is always speaking, to those who are prepared to deeply listen!” Whether by religious upbringing, teaching, or tradition, we tend to blindly pursue a dogma, suggesting that personal, intimate communication with the Divine, is solely restricted to those times when we express ourselves “heavenward,” in what is commonly referred to as prayer. If that’s true, then we’re getting a horrifically compromised return in our relationship to the Creator! What if we could be receiving what I like to refer to as a Divine Download 24/7, a non-stop 2-way communication with the Source of all Wisdom – one that is literally “out of this world?” Well, we can! It all depends on us, the heart we possess and “My Weekly Walk!!!” “As long as we settle for a heart of stone, we’ll never truly be free from the chains that bind us!

Cara always knew life on planet L’eihr would be an adjustment. With Aelyx, her L’eihr boyfriend, back on Earth, working to mend the broken alliance between their two planets, Cara is left to fend for herself at a new school, surrounded by hostile alien clones. Even the weird dorm pet hates her.Things look up when Cara is appointed as human representative to a panel preparing for a human colony on L’eihr. A society melding their two cultures is a place where Cara and Aelyx could one day make a life together. But with L’eihr leaders balking at granting even the most basic freedoms, Cara begins to wonder if she could ever be happy on this planet, even with Aelyx by her side.Meanwhile, on Earth, Aelyx, finds himself thrown into a full-scale PR campaign to improve human-L’eihr relations. Humans don’t know that their very survival depends on this alliance: only Aelyx’s people have the technology to fix the deadly contamination in the global water supply that human governments are hiding.

This charming inn is nestled out in the Sonoran Desert on the Apace Trail close to the foreboding Superstition Mountains which are said to be the home of the legendary Lost Dutchman Mine. Some say the inn sits atop an energy vortex that has ties to the mine. And this just may be the reason for all of the paranormal activity .You may just find that some of the guests who come to stay at the inn are as strange as the inn itself. 	The inn was a gift left to a family of three – a divorced mother, daughter and son - one of those being Dean Banks, a young fifteen year old boy who comes to find out he has inherited a supernatural gift of power from a long ago Apache ancestor and is destined to be the Guardian of the mine. He feels this is more of a curse than a gift. With these powers come some pretty unnatural occurrences for Dean as he acquires the ability to gain superhuman strength along with mystical powers which enable him to thwart any attempts from anyone to try to discover the whereabouts of the mine. Dean fears his new responsibility and also is terrified of the possibility of harming someone. We also find Dean in a power struggle as he tries to remain a normal teenage boy as he enjoys his life riding in the desert and hanging out with his newfound friends, which leads him to befriending a mysterious old miner he meets who holds the key to some of Dean’s past . This miner also has a secret past for Dean to discover.

","Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.",,,ebook,,181 pages,"

","""In the spring of 1984, I went to the northwest of France, to Normandy, to prepare an NBC documentary on the fortieth anniversary of D-Day, the massive and daring Allied invasion of Europe that marked the beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. There, I underwent a life-changing experience. As I walked the beaches with the American veterans who had returned for this anniversary, men in their sixties and seventies, and listened to their stories, I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had done. Ten years later, I returned to Normandy for the fiftieth anniversary of the invasion, and by then I had come to understand what this generation of Americans meant to history. It is, I believe, the greatest generation any society has ever produced.""        In this superb book, Tom Brokaw goes out into America, to tell through the stories of individual men and women the story of a generation, America's citizen heroes and heroines who came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America. This generation was united not only by a common purpose, but also by common values--duty, honor, economy, courage, service, love of family and country, and, above all, responsibility for oneself. In this book, you will meet people whose everyday lives reveal how a generation persevered through war, and were trained by it, and then went on to create interesting and useful lives and the America we have today.""At a time in their lives when their days and nights should have been filled with innocent adventure, love, and the lessons of the workaday world, they were fighting in the most primitive conditions possible across the bloodied landscape of France, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the coral islands of the Pacific. They answered the call to save the world from the two most powerful and ruthless military machines ever assembled, instruments of conquest in the hands of fascist maniacs. They faced great odds and a late start, but they did not protest. They succeeded on every front. They won the war; they saved the world. They came home to joyous and short-lived celebrations and immediately began the task of rebuilding their lives and the world they wanted. They married in record numbers and gave birth to another distinctive generation, the Baby Boomers. A grateful nation made it possible for more of them to attend college than any society had ever educated, anywhere. They gave the world new science, literature, art, industry, and economic strength unparalleled in the long curve of history. As they now reach the twilight of their adventurous and productive lives, they remain, for the most part, exceptionally modest. They have so many stories to tell, stories that in many cases they have never told before, because in a deep sense they didn't think that what they were doing was that special, because everyone else was doing it too. ""This book, I hope, will in some small way pay tribute to those men and women who have given us the lives we have today--an American family portrait album of the greatest generation.""                In this book you'll meet people like Charles Van Gorder, who set up during D-Day a MASH-like medical facility in the middle of the fighting, and then came home to create a clinic and hospital in his hometown. You'll hear George Bush talk about how, as a Navy Air Corps combat pilot, one of his assignments was to read the mail of the enlisted men under him, to be sure no sensitive military information would be compromised. And so, Bush says, ""I learned about life."" You'll meet Trudy Elion, winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine, one of the many women in this book who found fulfilling careers in the changed society as a result of the war. You'll meet Martha Putney, one of the first black women to serve in the newly formed WACs. And you'll meet the members of the Romeo Club (Retired Old Men Eating Out), friends for life.         Through these and other stories in The Greatest Generation, you'll relive with ordinary men and women, military heroes, famous people of great achievement, and community leaders how these extraordinary times forged the values and provided the training that made a people and a nation great.From the Hardcover edition.",0812975294,9780812975291),Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Cette trompe étrange que Robert Wolff découvre dans une maison vide, c’est la clé d’un univers étranger. Il lui suffit d’en tirer quelques notes pour ouvrir un porte dans l’espace et le temps et pénétrer dans un cosmos dont les lois n’ont rien de commun avec celles de notre univers d’étoiles et de planètes. Un cosmos où les mondes sont comme autant de plateaux empilés sur un formidable pic montagneux. Et la trompe d’argent permet de passer de l’un à l’autre, de création en création, jusqu’au sommet de la montagne, jusqu’à la retraite du Seigneur créateur, le Faiseur d’Univers. Mais celui-ci est-il un fou ? Un imposteur ? Ou un superbe criminel fuyant la colère d’êtres qui lui sont encore supérieurs ? Philip José Farmer s’est imposé en 10 ans comme l’un des Grands de la science-fiction moderne. Il fut le premier à chasser les traces de conformisme et de puritanisme qui subsistaient dans le genre avec « Les amants étrangers » où il décrivait avec passion et lyrisme les rapports sexuels entre les astronautes terriens et des créatures femelles, humanoïdes et ovipares. Avec « Le faiseur d’univers » il s’impose comme un véritable démiurge façonnant avec minutie mondes et créatures, mêmant intimement la science et le rêve.",2226033409,9782266012928),,,222 pages,"

","In Manhattan Hunt Club John Saul plumbs the depths of the Manhattan underground--the network of subway tunnels and secret caverns and chambers where the homeless denizens of the city have created their own society. It's a world Jeff Converse, a young college student convicted of a crime he didn't commit, never knew existed until he is plunged into it after an ""accident"" that occurs while he is being transported to prison. He soon realizes that it's no accident, but the opening move in a deadly game being played by some of the city's most powerful men and women, a game in which he is the prey and they are the hunters. Jeff's only chance to make it to the surface and survive lies in allying himself with a homicidal maniac who's appointed himself the young man's protector, but whose designs on Jeff are almost as lethal as those of his enemies in the Manhattan Hunt Club. Saul made his reputation in the horror genre, but he now focuses on psychological terrors rather than things that go bump in the night. His narrative gifts are displayed to great advantage in this heart-stopping thriller; the pacing is flawless and the central characters are very well developed. What keeps this from living up to its fullest potential is the inadequate motivation of the villains, who are largely one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. But that won't keep this otherwise topnotch thriller off the bestseller lists, where Saul (Nightshade, The Right Hand of Evil), like Stephen King, is a perennial contender for the number one spot. --Jane Adams",0345490649,9780345490643),Mass Market Paperback,,384 pages,"

","A woman goes into a bakery to buy a strawberry cream tart. The place is immaculate but there is no one serving so she waits. Another customer comes in. The woman tells the new arrival that she is buying her son a treat for his birthday. Every year she buys him his favourite cake; even though he died in an accident when he was six years old. From this beginning Yoko Ogawa weaves a dark and beautiful narrative that pulls together a seemingly disconnected cast of characters. In the tradition of classical Japanese poetic collections, the stories in Revenge are linked through recurring images and motifs, as each story follows on from the one before while simultaneously introducing new characters and themes. Filled with breathtaking images, Ogawa provides us with a slice of life that is resplendent in its chaos, enthralling in its passion and chilling in its cruelty.",1846555027,9781846555022),Paperback,,162 pages,"

","Karma - Destiny or Choice is a small effort to simplify and to explain one of the most important Law of Nature ""Karma"". I know most of us feel it boring but it might be due to lengthy or heavy content of books. This book is not a Literature Masterpiece but I have tried to convey message in the simplest language. It is not related to any religion but still related to every religion. It talks about the connection of Karma with GOD, Human Being, Relations, Anger, Helping, Soul etc. Karma plays a very crucial role at every stage of Life and Death. Sometimes we feel very helpless and sometimes we have options. If we see the fixed pattern of life then we may think that Karma is Destiny but when Life changes by our Choices then it makes us believe Karma as a choice. This book addresses and discusses the same. We will come across to a simple law of nature which is made or presented as complicated. When you read you will be able to relate as we all must have faced something similar in this Lifetime. Happy Reading and Please share your Views and Feedback...:-)",,,Kindle Edition,,98 pages,"

","The Classics Exposed... A fighting man from Earth and a haughty princess from Mars-their romance will set their worlds on fire. John Carter, red-blooded American soldier and fortune hunter, embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. He's transported to Mars-a dying planet ruled by violence. As an alien to the red planet and its gravity, Carter is gifted with great strength. His superhuman attributes come in handy-the bloodthirsty green Martians value triumph in battle over all else. Carter fights both red and green Martian warriors, but loses his heart to the jewel of Mars-Dejah Thoris. Dejah Thoris is the granddaughter of the most powerful leader of her planet. She is captured by her enemies and awaits a cruel execution. John Carter is willing to fight to the death to save her. He's handsome, powerful and clearly attracted to her-but the earthling's uncouth manners offend Dejah Thoris' highborn sensibilities. Carter yearns for the beautiful princess, even as she turns a cold cheek to him. With life and death in the balance and their hearts on the line, what will it take for Dejah Thoris of Mars to give herself to John Carter of Earth? And what deliciously exotic surprises await the lovers when their relationship finally deepens...?",1781845778,9781781845776),Paperback,,308 pages,"

","A stolen child.An ancient evil.A father’s descent.And the literary masterpiece that holds the key to his daughter’s salvation. Professor David Ullman is among the world’s leading authorities on demonic literature, with special expertise in Milton’s Paradise Lost. Not that David is a believer—he sees what he teaches as a branch of the imagination and nothing more. So when the mysterious Thin Woman arrives at his office and invites him to travel to Venice and witness a “phenomenon,” he turns her down. She leaves plane tickets and an address on his desk, advising David that her employer is not often disappointed.That evening, David’s wife announces she is leaving him. With his life suddenly in shambles, he impulsively whisks his beloved twelve-year-old daughter, Tess, off to Venice after all. The girl has recently been stricken by the same melancholy moods David knows so well, and he hopes to cheer her up and distract them both from the troubles at home.But what happens in Venice will change everything.First, in a tiny attic room at the address provided by the Thin Woman, David sees a man restrained in a chair, muttering, clearly insane . . . but could he truly be possessed? Then the man speaks clearly, in the voice of David’s dead father, repeating the last words he ever spoke to his son. Words that have left scars—and a mystery—behind.When David rushes back to the hotel, he discovers Tess perched on the roof’s edge, high above the waters of the Grand Canal. Before she falls, she manages to utter a final plea: Find me.What follows is an unimaginable journey for David Ullman from skeptic to true believer. In a terrifying quest guided by symbols and riddles from the pages of Paradise Lost, David must track the demon that has captured his daughter and discover its name.

","Karma's a Bitch by J.Gail If you think you can do somebody dirty and get away with it, just because you didn't get caught, you're dead wrong. All of that dirt comes back to you one way or another. Tony Jackson learns this lesson the hard way. Labeled the ""asshole of West Philly,"" Tony holds no shame in having other women in his girlfriend Quanisha's bed. There is little remorse after he knocks off a convenience store and beats the cashier with a gun. He'll rob from his girl, his friends, people he doesn't know and your mama. Whoever, he doesn't care. And we all know that when you get money wrong, you can't hold onto it for nothing! The question is when will Tony figure that out? Maybe when he starts getting his Karma instantly and mercilessly he'll get the hint. In fact, when will Tony get the big picture? That there's no future in his game. Will a dose of `Instant Karma' show him that not contributing to society in any positive way is guaranteed to get him a one way ticket to no where?",,,Kindle Edition,,256 pages,"

","The author of The Corset Diaries returns to the realm of the paranormal in this sexy, funny romance that pits Seattle-based Aisling Grey against Drake Vireo, a seriously handsome Parisian dragon in human form. In her job as courier, Aisling is to deliver a precious demonic artifact to a Mme. Deauxville in Paris, but she finds Madame freshly dead, surrounded by a circle of ash. The artifact is then stolen by the fast-talking Drake, who claims that Aisling is no mere courier but in fact a demon lord and his destined mate. Determined to play detective, Aisling summons up a demon only to find herself saddled with one, in the form of a slobbering Newfoundland who wants to go walkies. Drake wants to show her the way dragons mate, and then bodies seem to pile up all over Paris, making Aisling a corpse magnet and top suspect. It's going to take every screwy new ally she's got to solve this murder and adjust to her new life in a strange new world.",0451411528,9780451411525),Mass Market Paperback,,334 pages,"

Meanwhile, David, her shattered attorney husband, struggles with grief and the demands of caring for her houseful of damaged and beloved animals. But it is her absence from her last project, Cindy-- a chimpanzee who may unlock the mystery of communication and consciousness-- that will have the greatest impact on all of them.When Cindy is scheduled for a research experiment that will undoubtedly take her life, David must call upon everything he has learned from Helena to save her.

","The search for the meaning of Being is man's eternal quest and the subject of his greatest creations. Shivaji Sawant's Mrityunjaya is an outstanding instance of such a literary masterpiece in which a contemporary Marathi novelist investigates the meaning of the bewildering skein that is life through the personae of the Mahabharata protagonists. For over two decades since its first publication the vast non- Marathi and non-Hindi readership remained deprived of this remarkable exploration of the human psyche till the publication of this English translation by the Writers workshop – a contribution for which there is much to be grateful for. Mrityunjaya is the autobiography of Karna, and yet it is not just that. With deceptive case, Sawant brings into play an exceptional stylistic innovation by combining six ""dramatic soliloquies"" to form the nine books of this novel of epic dimensions. Four books are spoken by Karna. These are interspersed with a book each from the lips of his unwed mother Kunti, Duryodhana (who considers Karna his mainstay), Shon (Shatruntapa, his foster-brother, who here-worships him), his wife Vrishali to whom he is like a god and, last of all, Krishna. Sawant depicts an uncanny similarity between Krishna and Karna and hints at a mystic link between them, investing his protagonist with a more-than-human aura to offset the un-heroic and even unmanly acts which mar this tremendously complex and utterly fascinating creating of Vyasa.",,,Hardcover,,736 pages,"

","The fifth installment in the New York Times bestselling series by Lisa Lutz, featuring the fearless private investigator Izzy Spellman and her quirky, yet endearing, family of sleuths.For the first time in Spellman history, Isabel Spellman might be the most normal member of her family. Mom has taken on an outrageous assortment of extracurricular activities. Dad has a secret. Her brother and sister are at war, but neither will reveal the source of the conflict. While domestic disturbances abound, there is one source of sanity in the Spellman household: Demetrius Merriweather, employee of the month for eighteen months straight. Things aren’t any simpler on the business side of Spellman Investigations. First, Rae is hired to follow a girl, only to fake the surveillance reports. Then a socialite has Isabel tail her husband, despite a conspicuous lack of suspicion. A man in a sweater vest hires the Spellmans to follow his sister, who turns out to be the socialite. Izzy won’t stop hunting for the answers—even when they threaten to shatter both the business and the family.Readers are sure to love the next novel in a “series that keeps getting better and better” (Publishers Weekly, starred review). ",1451608128,9781451608120),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","The eagerly awaited new book from the Emmy-winning, Oscar-hosting, Daily Show-anchoring Jon Stewart--the man behind the megaseller America (The Book). Where do we come from? Who created us? Why are we here? These questions have puzzled us since the dawn of time, but when it became apparent to Jon Stewart and the writers of The Daily Show that the world was about to end, they embarked on a massive mission to write a book that summed up the human race: What we looked like; what we accomplished; our achievements in society, government, religion, science and culture -- all in a tome of approximately 256 pages with lots of color photos, graphs and charts. After two weeks of hard work, they had their book. EARTH (The Book) is the definitive guide to our species. With their trademark wit, irreverence, and intelligence, Stewart and his team will posthumously answer all of life's most hard-hitting questions, completely unburdened by objectivity, journalistic integrity, or even accuracy.

A few floors above, Rhen rests trapped in a coma, about to wake to a changed world—a world where his best friend is a woman, his nephew is the king, and an enemy army surrounds him on all sides. But human wars are insignificant compared to the darkness gathering unseen. Memories of lives she never lived flash through Jinji's thoughts, hinting at a past that cannot be repeated. A mysterious phantom visits Rhen, carrying cryptic messages of the future. And somewhere out there, the shadow continues to lurk in silence. Startled by their altered relationship and tempted by new feelings, Rhen and Jinji must find a way to work together.

","Fans of Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s The Shadow of the Wind and Sebastian Faulks’s Birdsong will fall in love with Winter in Madrid, the arresting new novel from C.J. Sansom. In September 1940, the Spanish Civil War is over and Madrid lies in ruins while the Germans continue their march through Europe. Britain stands alone as General Franco considers whether to abandon neutrality and enter the war. Into this uncertain world comes Harry Brett, a privileged young man who was recently traumatized by his experience in Dunkirk and is now a reluctant spy for the British Secret Service. Sent to gain the confidence of Sandy Forsyth, an old school friend turned shadowy Madrid businessman, Brett finds himself involved in a dangerous game and surrounded by memories. Meanwhile, Sandy’s girlfriend, ex-Red Cross nurse Barbara Clare, is engaged in a secret mission of her own—to find her former lover Bernie Piper, whose passion for the Communist cause led him into the International Brigades and who vanished on the bloody battlefields of the Jarama.In a vivid and haunting depiction of wartime Spain, Winter in Madrid is an intimate and riveting tale that offers a remarkable sense of history unfolding and the profound impact of impossible choices.",0330411985,9780330411981),Paperback,,549 pages,"

","Mór Jókai (1825-1904) was the first Hungarian novelist to achieve world fame. ""The Man with the Golden Touch"" was published in several foreign languages in his lifetime, appearing in more than one English edition under the title ""Tímár's Two Worlds"" and in the U.S.A. as ""Modern Midas.""Set in a small town on the Danube - Komárom - where Jókai had spent his childhood, in the early years of the nineteenth century, it is the story of Mihály Timár. Chance brings him into a fabulous fortune, and from then on, he succeeds in all ventures he undertakes, and everything he touches turns to gold: his only failure, and one which comes to turn his riches to dross, is his marriage. In his search for happiness, he comes to hate his wealth. He finally escapes from his double life, and finds refuge on a wild island in the Danube where the love of a young girl, Noémi, gives real meaning to his existence.""The Man with the Golden Touch"" is a jewel of both Hungarian and world literature, and is indeed one of the most beautiful romantic novels.

","Violet Parry is living the quintessential life of luxury in the Hollywood Hills with David, her rock-and-roll manager husband, and her darling toddler, Dot. She has the perfect life--except that she's deeply unhappy. David expects the world of Violet but gives little of himself in return. When she meets Teddy, a roguish small-time bass player, Violet comes alive, and soon she's risking everything for the chance to find herself again. Also in the picture are David's hilariously high-strung sister, Sally, on the prowl for a successful husband, and Jeremy, the ESPN sportscaster savant who falls into her trap. For all their recklessness, Violet and Sally will discover that David and Jeremy have a few surprises of their own. THIS ONE IS MINE is a compassionate and wickedly funny satire about our need for more--and the often disastrous choices we make in the name of happiness.",031603116X,9780316031165),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Can a ship carrying Friendship Dolls to Japan be Lexie’s ticket to see her fun-loving mother again? A heartwarming historical novel inspired by a little-known true event.It’s 1926, and the one thing eleven-year-old Lexie Lewis wants more than anything is to leave Portland, Oregon, where she has been staying with her strict grandparents, and rejoin her mother, a carefree singer in San Francisco’s speakeasies. But Mama’s new husband doesn’t think a little girl should live with parents who work all night and sleep all day. Meanwhile, Lexie’s class has been raising money to ship a doll to the children of Japan in a friendship exchange, and when Lexie learns that the girl who writes the best letter to accompany the doll will be sent to the farewell ceremony in San Francisco, she knows she just has to be the winner. But what if a jealous classmate and Lexie’s own small lies to her grandmother manage to derail her plans? Inspired by a project organized by teacher-missionary Sidney Gulick, in which U.S. children sent more than 12,000 Friendship Dolls to Japan in hopes of avoiding a future war, Shirley Parenteau’s engaging story has sure appeal for young readers who enjoy historical fiction, and for doll lovers of all ages.",0763670030,9780763670030),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","No one crosses the wall of light . . . except for one girl who doesn’t remember who she is, where she came from, or how she survived. A harrowing, powerful debut thriller about finding yourself and protecting your future—no matter how short and uncertain it may be. The Arclight is the last defense. The Fade can’t get in. Outside the Arclight’s border of high-powered beams is the Dark. And between the Light and the Dark is the Grey, a narrow, barren no-man’s-land. That’s where the rescue team finds Marina, a lone teenage girl with no memory of the horrors she faced or the family she lost. Marina is the only person who has ever survived an encounter with the Fade. She’s the first hope humanity has had in generations, but she could also be the catalyst for their final destruction. Because the Fade will stop at nothing to get her back. Marina knows it. Tobin, who’s determined to take his revenge on the Fade, knows it. Anne-Marie, who just wishes it were all over, knows it.When one of the Fade infiltrates the Arclight and Marina recognizes it, she will begin to unlock secrets she didn’t even know she had.

","Pa`nop´ti`con ( noun). A circular prison with cells so constructed that the prisoners can be observed at all times. [Greek panoptos 'seen by all'] Anais Hendricks, fifteen, is in the back of a police car, headed for the Panopticon, a home for chronic young offenders. She can't remember the events that led her here, but across town a policewoman lies in a coma and there is blood on Anais's school uniform. Smart, funny and fierce, Anais is a counter-culture outlaw, a bohemian philosopher in sailor shorts and a pillbox hat. She is also a child who has been let down, or worse, by just about every adult she has ever met. The residents of the Panopticon form intense bonds, heightened by their place on the periphery, and Anais finds herself part of an ad hoc family there. Much more suspicious are the social workers, especially Helen, who is about to leave her job for an elephant sanctuary in India but is determined to force Anais to confront the circumstances of her birth before she goes. Looking up at the watchtower that looms over the residents, Anais knows her fate: she is part of an experiment, she always was, it's a given, a liberty - a fact. And the experiment is closing in. In language dazzling, energetic and pure, The Panopticon introduces us to a heartbreaking young heroine and an incredibly assured and outstanding new voice in fiction.",0434021776,9780434021772),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film contains all of Deren's essays on her own films as well as more general essays on film theory, the relation of film to dance, various technical aspects of film production, the distinction between amateur and professional filmmaking, and the famous 1946 chapbook titled ""An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film,"" which has been reset here for the first time. There are hard-to-find articles written for magazines and art journals, as well as lectures, Q&A sessions, program notes, and manifestoes. This book will be particularly welcomed by the large audience that saw Martina Kudlacek's documentary, ""In the Mirror of Maya Deren,"" during its theatrical release in the U.S. and Europe in 2002. The importance of Maya Deren's films and writings is further evidenced by the American Film Institute having named its highest award for independent filmmaking the ""Maya Deren.""",0929701658,9780929701653),Paperback,,260 pages,"

Plans for that happy future are squashed when Sara's bigoted father finds out about Sam's mixed Japanese-American heritage. He refuses to allow his daughter to date a ""breed,"" and devises a cruel scheme to separate them for good. Years later, Sara seeks legal help, and the lawyer she contacts is Sam.

","Mare Barrow's world is divided by blood—those with red and those with silver. Mare and her family are lowly Reds, destined to serve the Silver elite whose supernatural abilities make them nearly gods. Mare steals what she can to help her family survive, but when her best friend is conscripted into the army she gambles everything to win his freedom. A twist of fate leads her to the royal palace itself, where, in front of the king and all his nobles, she discovers a power of her own—an ability she didn't know she had. Except . . . her blood is Red.To hide this impossibility, the king forces her into the role of a lost Silver princess and betroths her to one of his own sons. As Mare is drawn further into the Silver world, she risks her new position to aid the Scarlet Guard—the leaders of a Red rebellion. Her actions put into motion a deadly and violent dance, pitting prince against prince—and Mare against her own heart.From debut author Victoria Aveyard comes a lush, vivid fantasy series where loyalty and desire can tear you apart and the only certainty is betrayal.",0062346512,9780062346513),Audiobook,Unabridged,13 pages,"

","What would cause an eighteen-year-old old senior class president and homecoming queen from Nashville, Tennessee, to disappoint her parents by forgoing college, break her little brother's heart, lose all but a handful of her friends (because the rest of them think she has gone off the deep end), and break up with the love of her life, all so she could move to Uganda, where she knew only one person but didn't know any of the language? A passion to make a difference. Katie Davis left over Christmas break her senior year for a short mission trip to Uganda and her life was turned completely inside out. She found herself so moved by the people and children of Uganda that she knew her calling was to return and care for them. She has given up a relatively comfortable life--at a young age--to care for the less fortunate of this world. She was so moved by the need she witnessed, she's centered her life around meeting that need. Katie, a charismatic and articulate young woman, is in the process of ""adopting"" 13 children in Uganda, and she completely trusts God for daily provision for her and her family. Despite the rough conditions in which Katie lives, she has found a life of service to God to be one of great joy. Katie's children bring constant delight and help her help others by welcoming whoever comes to their door. As the challenges grow, so does Katie's faith and her certainty that what she's doing in Uganda, one person at a time, will have far-reaching rewards. It isn't the life she planned, but it is the life she loves.To further her reach into the needs of Ugandans, Katie established Amazima Ministries. The ministry matches orphaned children with sponors worldwide. Each sponsor's $300/year provides schooling, school supplies, three hot meals a day, minor medical care, and spiritual encouragement. Katie expected to have forty children in the program; she had signed up 150 by January 2008; today it sponsors over 400. Another aspect of the ministry is a feeding program created for the displaced Karamojong people--Uganda's poorest citizens. The program feeds lunch to over 1200 children Monday-Friday and sends them home with a plate of food; it also offers basic medical care, Bible study, and general health training.Katie Davis, now 22, is more than fascinating, she's inspiring, as she has wholeheartedly answered the call to serve.",1451612109,9781451612103),ebook,,288 pages,"

","One of the most famous and admired African-American women in U.S. history, Sojourner Truth sang, preached, and debated at camp meetings across the country, led by her devotion to the antislavery movement and her ardent pursuit of women's rights. Born into slavery in 1797, Truth fled from bondage some 30 years later to become a powerful figure in the progressive movements reshaping American society.This remarkable narrative, first published in 1850, offers a rare glimpse into the little-documented world of Northern slavery. Truth recounts her life as a slave in rural New York, her separation from her family, her religious conversion, and her life as a traveling preacher during the 1840s. She also describes her work as a social reformer, counselor of former slaves, and sponsor of a black migration to the West.A spellbinding orator and implacable prophet, Truth mesmerized audiences with her tales of life in bondage and with her moving renditions of Methodist hymns and her own songs. Frederick Douglass described her message as a ""strange compound of wit and wisdom, of wild enthusiasm, and flint-like common sense."" This inspiring account of a black woman's struggles for racial and sexual equality is essential reading for students of American history, as well as for those interested in the continuing quest for equality of opportunity.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","New Grub Street (1891), George Gissing's most highly regarded novel, is the story of men and women forced to make their living by writing. Their daily lives and broken dreams, made and marred by the rigors of urban life and the demands of the fledgling mass communications industry, are presented with vivid realism and unsentimental sympathy. Its telling juxtaposition of the writing careers of the clever and malicious Jaspar Milvain and the honest and struggling Edward Reardon quickly made New Grub Street into a classic work of late Victorian fiction.

Als Amelia Gray tegen haar zin betrokken raakt bij het onderzoek naar de moord op een rechercheur, komt ze opnieuw in contact met John Devlin. Maar hoewel ze nog steeds verliefd op hem is, houdt ze hem op een afstand. Ze weet te goed dat ze anders met krachten te maken krijgt die zeer bedreigend voor haar zijn. Tijdens haar speurtocht naar de moordenaar verdwaalt ze in een waar doolhof van zwarte magie en raadselen. En omdat het erop lijkt dat John de enige is die daar de uitweg uit kan weten, laat ze hem weer toe in haar leven. Want hoe dieper ze graaft, hoe meer ze ervan overtuigd raakt dat de moord iets met gebeurtenissen uit zijn verleden te maken heeft. Verschrikkelijke gebeurtenissen, waar hij niet over wil praten.

","La généralisation du règne de l'argent est en marche. Ultime expression de l'individualisme, elle explique l'essentiel des soubresauts de l'Histoire: pour l'accélérer; pour la refuser; pour l'orienter. Si cette évolution va à son terme, l'humanité disparaîtra. Si par contre l'homme recule devant cet avenir et interrompt cette généralisation du libéralisme, il basculera dans une succession de barbaries et de totalitarismes dans des batailles que je nommerai ""l'hyperconflit"". Et l'humanité disparaîtra aussi, mais tout autrement. Si, enfin, la mondialisation peut être contenue sans être refusée, et si le marché peut être dépassé sans être aboli, s'ouvrira pour l'humanité un nouvel infini de démocratie, de liberté, de responsabilité, de création et de dignité. C'est que je nommerai ""l'hyperdémocratie"". Trois avenirs s'ouvriront donc devant nous au-delà de l'actuelle domination de l'empire américain 'provisoire, comme celle de tous ses prédécesseurs: hyperempire, hyperconflit, hyperdémocratie. Deux avenirs mortels, un troisième impossible. Je crois que le troisième l'emportera après un demi-siècle de chaos.

","Um estrondoso épico romântico… Uma aventura histórica notável…O Oriente e o Ocidente em confronto… Um verdadeiro clássico contemporâneo!China, finais do séc. XIX. Os estrangeiros residentes na cidade de Shishan são surpreendidos pelas convulsões da revolta dos Boxers, uma brutal rebelião dos camponeses chineses contra a colonização estrangeira e a submissão da dinastia Manchu à dominação europeia no Império da Grande Muralha.Será neste sanguinário pano de fundo que esta imponente saga nos irá narrar o sensual caso amoroso de Henry Manners, um agente secreto Vitoriano, com Helen Delamere, a bonita filha de um comerciante local, educada num convento. Nesta cidade, a vida social dos estrangeiros, gira em redor de Dr. Edward Airton, um compassivo médico escocês que dirige um hospital e uma missão. Mas o seu papel não é apenas este.

","Kipling fue la voz del Imperio Británico. Desvanecido el Imperio, se desvaneció también el bardo que lo cantó y que al final de su vida comprendía que las cosas acaban. Este escritor durante mucho tiempo apoyó algo contra lo que después luchó.Los cuentos de Kipling son modelos de arte narrativo, de movimiento, de concisión y de energía expresiva. Al paso de los años, como todo clásico, no han perdido su poder de sugerencia.El libro de las tierras vírgenes refleja en gran parte el mundo de la niñez de Kipling. Se retrajo a las luces, los colores, las formas, olores y sonidos de su infancia en la India. Sus escritos ejercen una atracción que va más allá del cuento para niños y muchachos, más allá de la fábula y la intención didáctica. A diferencia de otras fábulas o de otros relatos de aventuras, poseen una cualidad misteriosa, una virtud que se escapa a la detección filológica.",9700757323,9789700757322),Paperback,,229 pages,"

","In her comic, scathing essay “Men Explain Things to Me,” Rebecca Solnit took on what often goes wrong in conversations between men and women. She wrote about men who wrongly assume they know things and wrongly assume women don’t, about why this arises, and how this aspect of the gender wars works, airing some of her own hilariously awful encounters.She ends on a serious note— because the ultimate problem is the silencing of women who have something to say, including those saying things like, “He’s trying to kill me!”This book features that now-classic essay with six perfect complements, including an examination of the writer Virginia Woolf ’s embrace of mystery, of not knowing, of doubt and ambiguity, a highly original inquiry into marriage equality, and a terrifying survey of the scope of contemporary violence against women.",,,Kindle Edition,,130 pages,"

","In the first of a brand new series set in Victorian England, a young woman returns home from India after the death of her family to discover her identity and inheritance are challenged by the man who holds her future in his hands. Rebecca Ravenshaw, daughter of missionaries, spent most of her life in India. Following the death of her family in the Indian Mutiny, Rebecca returns to claim her family estate in Hampshire, England. Upon her return, people are surprised to see her… and highly suspicious. Less than a year earlier, an imposter had arrived with an Indian servant and assumed not only Rebecca’s name, but her home and incomes.That pretender died within months of her arrival; the servant fled to London as the young woman was hastily buried at midnight. The locals believe that perhaps she, Rebecca, is the real imposter. Her home and her father’s investments reverted to a distant relative, the darkly charming Captain Luke Whitfield, who quickly took over. Against her best intentions, Rebecca begins to fall in love with Luke, but she is forced to question his motives–does he love her or does he just want Headbourne House? If Luke is simply after the property, as everyone suspects, would she suffer a similar fate as the first “Rebecca”?A captivating Gothic love story set against a backdrop of intrigue and danger, Mist of Midnight will leave you breathless.",1476717869,9781476717869),Paperback,,374 pages,"

","When Lily Jacobs was born, she inherited Fazire – a genie. Her family had three wishes and they’d only ever used one so Fazire was stuck in the human world. This worked since he’d become a member of the family anyway.  Even with a genie, Lily's young life wasn’t perfect. To escape the kids making her miserable at school, Lily buried herself in romance novels. One day, when the teasing was just too much, she used one of her wishes. She told Fazire she wanted to find a man like in her books and she made the most complicated wish Fazire had ever heard. Her wished-for man had to be impossibly handsome, virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless (amongst a dozen other things).  He also had to think she was beautiful and he had to love her more than anything in the world.  Nathaniel McAllister wasn’t born to a life where there were such things as genies granting wishes. His life was filled with drugs, crime and neglect. He was running errands for a gangster before he was in his teens and, even though life and hard work led him to wealth and respectability, he always knew, deep down, he was dirty. When Nate met Lily he knew he was no good for her but as virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless as he was, Nate was no match for the pull of sweet, innocent Lily.  Unfortunately, Lily’s wish included that she and her hero go through trials and tribulations to test their love. And Fazire wasn’t only a good genie, he loved Lily – so he gave her exactly what she wanted.",,,Kindle Edition,,409 pages,"

There is, however, one conspicuous absence: Judd's wife, Jen, whose affair with his radio- shock-jock boss has recently become painfully public. Simultaneously mourning the demise of his father and his marriage, Judd joins his dysfunctional family as they reluctantly sit shiva-and spend seven days and nights under the same roof. The week quickly spins out of control as longstanding grudges resurface, secrets are revealed and old passions are reawakened. Then Jen delivers the clincher: she's pregnant.

"," Kreuzberger sind schon komische Vögel. Sie sitzen Abend für Abend am Tresen, trinken Kristallweizen ohne Zitrone und gehen erst ins Bett, wenn Mutti in Bremen schon wieder aufsteht. Und wenn draußen die Mauer fällt, bestellen sie erst mal in Ruhe noch ein Bier. Denn was ist schon das Ende der Geschichte (denkt sich der Leser am Ende dieser Geschichte) gegen die Frage, ob die Zeit schneller oder langsamer vergeht, wenn man betrunken ist? Herr Lehmann ist Kreuzberger. Kreuzberger sind Menschen, die irgendwann einmal aus Schwaben, Achim oder Herford nach Berlin gekommen und dort ""hängen geblieben"" sind. Herr Lehmann kommt ursprünglich aus Bremen und möchte eigentlich Frank genannt werden, aber das ignorieren seine Freunde: denn bald ist Herrn Lehmanns dreißigster Geburtstag. Und 30 Jahre alt zu werden, weiß Herr Lehmann, ist Scheiße, weil man da langsam ""beginnt, eine Vergangenheit zu haben, eine gute alte Zeit und den ganzen Scheiß."" Und weil auf einmal alle anfangen zu fragen, was man denn bitte schön anfangen wolle mit dem eigenen Leben. Denn dass jemand zufrieden damit ist, Kellner zu sein, ist in dieser Stadt, in der alle ""eigentlich Künstler"" sind, nicht vorgesehen -- ""aber was ist das für ein trauriger Umgang mit dem, was man tut, wenn man es immer nur als Zwischenlösung ansieht, als nichts Richtiges?"" Sven Regener kennt, wovon er schreibt. Als Sänger und Texter der Berliner Band Element of Crime ist er seit genau jenen Spätachtzigern, in denen die Romanhandlung spielt, immer auch genauer Chronist eines Kreuzberger Lebensgefühls jenseits von ""Kreuzberger Nächte sind lang"" gewesen. Mit Herr Lehmann ist ihm das erstaunliche Kunststück gelungen, jene zärtlich-rotzige Nonchalance, die seine Lieder auszeichnet, umstandslos in die lange Form zu überführen -- und das gleich in seinem literarischen Erstlingswerk! Mit seinem Roman setzt Regener jenem merkwürdig zeitlosen Kreuzberg der Vorwendezeit, das einem heute so weit weg erscheinen will, so etwas wie ein Denkmal -- für die Zeit Damals hinterm Mond. Doch trotz so schöner Einsichten wie ""Der Elekrolytmangel ist der größte Feind des Trinkers. Von der Dehydrierung einmal abgesehen"", geht es hier keineswegs nur ums Bohème-Leben im Allgemeinen und ums Trinken im Besonderen. Das Ganze ist nämlich auch eine Art Entwicklungsroman -- freilich zu Kreuzberger Bedingungen: Muss doch der Held -- für den es anfangs noch eine Qual ist, wenn er auf dem Weg von Kreuzberg nach Kreuzberg durch Neukölln muss -- gegen Ende des Romans immerhin zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass es auch hinter der Oberbaumbrücke noch Menschen gibt. Das Ende der Geschichte? Erst mal losgehen, denkt sich Herr Lehmann. ""Der Rest wird sich schon irgendwie ergeben."" Pflichtlektüre für die Jahrgänge 1959-1969, für Kreuzberger sowieso. --Axel Henrici",3442453305,9783442453306),Paperback,,286 pages,"

Se trezeşte în fiecare dimineaţă neştiind unde se află. O formă rară de amnezie o împiedică să reţină informaţii mai mult de 24 de ore. Crede că are cu 20 de ani puţin, că este singură şi că are întreaga viaţă înainte. Dar descoperă că locuieşte cu soţul ei, Ben şi că majoritatea deciziilor importante din viaţa sa au fost deja luate. Doctorul ei o sfătuieşte să ţină un jurnal care o ajută să-şi recompună amintirile de la o zi la alta. Dar într-o zi deschide jurnalul şi citeşte: ""Să nu ai niciodată încredere în Ben"".Oare ce tip de accident a adus-o în această stare?În cine să aibă încredere?De ce ar minţi-o Ben?O cheamă Christine.

Τα μέλη της δείχνουν άκακοι, συνηθισμένοι άνθρωποι, ηλικιωμένοι οι περισσότεροι. Όπως όμως ξέρει ο Νταν Τόρανς, και ανακαλύπτει η θαρραλέα μικρή Αμπρα Στόουν, είναι σχεδόν αθάνατοι και ζουν με τον «ατμό» που παράγουν τα παιδιά που έχουν τη «λάμψη» όταν θανατώνονται αργά και βασανιστικά.Στοιχειωμένος από τους ενοίκους του Ξενοδοχείου Η Θέα όπου πέρασε μια φρικαλέα χρονιά όταν ήταν παιδί, ο Νταν τριγυρίζει άσκοπα επί δεκαετίες, προσπαθώντας απεγνωσμένα να απαλλαγεί από την κληρονομιά της απελπισίας, του αλκοολισμού και της βίας που του άφησε ο πατέρας του. Καταλήγει σε μια κωμόπολη του Νιου Χάμσαϊρ, σε μια κοινότητα των ΑΑ που τον στηρίζει, και σε μια δουλειά σε έναν οίκο ευγηρίας, όπου με όση δύναμη λάμψης του έχει απομείνει προσφέρει την ύστατη ανακούφιση στους ετοιμοθάνατους. Γίνεται γιΆ αυτούς ο «Δόκτωρ Ύπνος».Μέχρι που γνωρίζει την Αμπρα Στόουν… Το θεαματικό χάρισμά της, η πιο δυνατή λάμψη που έχει υπάρξει ποτέ, ξυπνάει τους δαίμονες του Νταν και τον καλεί σε μια μάχη για τη σωτηρία της ψυχής της Αμπρα και της ζωής της. Πρόκειται για έναν επικό πόλεμο ανάμεσα στο καλό και το κακό, μια αιματηρή, μεγαλειώδη ιστορία που θα συναρπάσει τα εκατομμύρια των αφοσιωμένων αναγνωστών της «Λάμψης» και θα ικανοποιήσει κάθε νεοφερμένο στο σύμπαν του έργου του Στίβεν Κινγκ.",,,Mass Market Paperback,,576 pages,"

","Andrea Gibson's dynamic and energetic first book, Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns, challenges us to not only read, but to react. Hauntingly vivid, the poems march through a soldier's lingering psychological wounds, tackle the curious questions of school children on the meaning of ""hate,"" and tangle with a lover's witty and vibrant description of longing. Gibson's poems deconstruct the current political climate through stunning imagery and careful crafting. With the same velocity, the poignant and vacillating love poems sweep the air out of the room. It's word-induced hypoxia. Pole Dancing to Gospel Hymns whispers with a bold and unforgettable internal voice rich with the kind of questioning that inspires action.",0981521304,9780981521305),Paperback,,99 pages,"

","Jeremy Clarkson shares his opinions on just about everything in The World According to Clarkson.

Jeremy Clarkson has seen rather more of the world than most. He has, as they say, been around a bit. And as a result, he's got one or two things to tell us about how it all works; and being Jeremy Clarkson he's not about to voice them quietly, humbly and without great dollops of humour.In The World According to Clarkson, he reveals why it is that:Too much science is bad for our health'70s rock music is nothing to be ashamed ofHunting foxes while drunk and wearing night-sights is neither big nor cleverWe must work harder to get rid of cricketHe likes the Germans (well, sometimes)With a strong dose of common sense that is rarely, if ever, found inside the M25, Clarkson hilariously attacks the pompous, the ridiculous, the absurd and the downright idiotic, whilst also celebrating the eccentric, the clever and the sheer bloody brilliant.Less a manifesto for living and more a road map to modern life, The World According to Clarkson is the funniest book you'll read this year. Don't leave home without it.",0141017899,9780141017891),Paperback,,327 pages,"

Adrift among them, the narrator, Arun, a struggling writer of detective novels in Urdu, waits for inspiration to write a blockbuster. Meanwhile, he seeks reassurance in love, and finds it in unusual places: with the young prostitute Kamla, wise beyond her years; and the orphan Suraj, homeless and an epileptic, yet surprisingly optimistic about the future. this is a memorable story about small lives, with all the hallmarks of classic Ruskin Bond prose: nostalgia, charm, underplayed humour and quiet wisdom.",0140246061,9780140246063),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","  THEIR ORIGINS ARE A MYSTERY. THEIR FUTURE IS AT HAND.   For thousands of years the Meq have existed side by side with humanity—appearing as twelve-year-old children, unsusceptible to wounds and disease, dying only by extraordinary means. They have survived through the rise and fall of empires and emperors, through explorations, expansions, and war. Five sacred stones give a few of them mystical powers, but not the power to understand a long-destined event called the Remembering.In the aftermath of the nuclear bombing of Japan in 1945, Zianno Zezen finds himself alone, while the fate of the other Meq and his beloved Opari, carrier of the Stone of Blood, is unknown. But Z’s archenemy, the Fleur-du-Mal, survives. In the next half century Z will reunite with far-flung friends both Meq and human, as American and Soviet spies vie to steal and harness the powers and mysteries of the timeless children. With the day of the Remembering rapidly approaching, Z must interpret the strange writing on an ancient etched stone sphere. In those markings, Z will discover messages within messages and begin a journey to the truth about his people and himself.Lyrical and mesmerizing, The Remembering spans the world and history, from the first humans to a secret that has never been told before. The Remembering is the moving saga of the Meq—their purpose, past, and future among us.",034547094X,9780345470942),Paperback,,304 pages,"

And there are no strangers in the town of Near.These are the truths that Lexi has heard all her life. But when an actual stranger-a boy who seems to fade like smoke-appears outside her home on the moor at night, she knows that at least one of these sayings is no longer true.The next night, the children of Near start disappearing from their beds, and the mysterious boy falls under suspicion. Still, he insists on helping Lexi search for them.

When word travels that the most feared fighters of the Muslim world, the Imesebelen, are advancing on Toledo, the innkeeper tells his son, Diego, to flee with his sisters. But Diego refuses to abandon his father. The old man and one of his daughters are slaughtered, and the other two girls are kidnapped.

","The entire scientific world mourned the loss of Professor Dowell. It was said that just before his death he was on the verge of a breakthrough in the transplantation of human organs.Marie Laurent felt privileged to work for the professor’s brilliant associate, Professor Kern. But her feelings turned to shock and revulsion when she entered Kern’s laboratory and discovered—sitting on a table, surrounded by tubes and tanks, its eyes blinking and lips moving—Professor Dowell’s head!Thus begins a classic tale of horror and suspense by Alexander Beliaev, the bestselling Soviet science fiction author of all time, whose work is considered by many readers the equal of Wells’ and Verne’s.Written half a century ago, this prophetic novel foresees not only organ transplants but other disturbing phenomena of our time, such as the use of mental hospitals as prisons and the manipulation of the news media. In the heads that Kern “rescues” from death, we see a poignant parable of mankind’s disembodied life in a high-technology age.The escape of one of the heads—after its transplantation to the body of an opera star—is the catalyst for the story’s hair-raising climax, as Marie Laurent and Professor Dowell’s son race against time to bring Kern to justice. Kern is a cunning adversary, armed with formidable weapons, both real and psychological. Pursuing him means hairbreadth escapes and sudden reversals—with the outcome uncertain right up to the last page.",0025083708,9780025083707),Hardcover,,157 pages,"

Tolkien and, most of all, of finding love. But he may never get what he wants, thanks to the fukú–the ancient curse that has haunted Oscar's family for generations, dooming them to prison, torture, tragic accidents, and, above all, ill-starred love. Oscar, still dreaming of his first kiss, is only its most recent victim–until the fateful summer that he decides to be its last.With dazzling energy and insight, Junot Díaz immerses us in the uproarious lives of our hero Oscar, his runaway sister Lola, and their ferocious beauty-queen mother Belicia, and in the family's epic journey from Santo Domingo to Washington Heights to New Jersey's Bergenline and back again. Rendered with uncommon warmth and humor, THE BRIEF WONDROUS LIFE OF OSCAR WAO presents an astonishing vision of the contemporary American experience and the endless human capacity to persevere–and to risk it all–in the name of love.

","In this intimate portrait of an extraordinary father-son relationship, Mark K. Shriver discovers the moral principles that guided his legendary father and applies them to his own lifeWhen Sargent ""Sarge"" Shriver—founder of the Peace Corps and architect of President Johnson's War on Poverty—died in 2011 after a valiant fight with Alzheimer's, thousands of tributes poured in from friends and strangers worldwide. These tributes, which extolled the daily kindness and humanity of ""a good man,"" moved his son Mark far more than those who lauded Sarge for his big-stage, headline-making accomplishments. After a lifetime searching for the path to his father's success in the public arena, Mark instead turns to a search for the secret of his father's joy, his devotion to others, and his sense of purpose. Mark discovers notes and letters from Sarge; hears personal stories from friends and family that zero in on the three guiding principles of Sarge's life—faith, hope, and love—and recounts moments with Sarge that now take on new value and poignancy. In the process, Mark discovers much about himself, as a father, as a husband, and as a social justice advocate. A Good Man is an inspirational and deeply personal story about a son discovering the true meaning of his father's legacy.",0805095306,9780805095302),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Backed by only his servant and best friend, Roc, he leaves his lavish lifestyle in the Sun Realm, seeking to make something good out of his troubled life.When a war breaks out within the Tri-Realms, Tristan is thrust into the middle of a conflict that seems to mysteriously follow Adele as she seeks to find her family and uncover her parents true past.In their world, someone must die.",,,Kindle Edition,,369 pages,"

Estudiantes, obreros, padres y madres de familia, profesores, empleados, soldados y hombres de estado, en fin, diversos componentes de la sociedad mexicana actual, aportan su modo de ver, sentir y considerar los acontecimientos. No se trata de emitir un juicio general, sino de recoger la experiencia misma y su reflejo en la memoria de muchos.

","Rahul Pandita was fourteen years old in 1990 when he was forced to leave his home in Srinagar along with his family, who were Kashmiri Pandits: the Hindu minority within a Muslim majority Kashmir that was becoming increasingly agitated with the cries of ‘Azadi’ from India. The heartbreaking story of Kashmir has so far been told through the prism of the brutality of the Indian state, and the pro-independence demands of separatists. But there is another part of the story that has remained unrecorded and buried. Our Moon Has Blood Clots is the unspoken chapter in the story of Kashmir, in which it was purged of the Kashmiri Pandit community in a violent ethnic cleansing backed by Islamist militants. Hundreds of people were tortured and killed, and about 3,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave their homes and spend the rest of their lives in exile in their own country. Rahul Pandita has written a deeply personal, powerful and unforgettable story of history, home and loss.",,,Paperback,,257 pages,"

","Category six wizard, Josephine O’Connor, is called in to help with a series of murders involving dark magic. Unfortunately, the killer covers his tracks very well and destroys virtually all trace of psychometric energy which makes the crime scene unreadable – even for a talent such as Josephine. By all rights, Josephine shouldn’t be forced to contend with this case. After all, she’s a retired eighty-four-year-old and she can hardly be blamed for having a beautiful body akin to a woman in her mid-twenties. It’s just one of the perks of being a rare category six. Josephine’s problems pile up to insurmountable odds as the killer grows stronger, Detective Riley pesters her for a quick resolution to this challenging case, and her obnoxious neighbor starts harassing her just because she looks too young to live in a retirement community.",1484020855,9781484020852),Paperback,,372 pages,"

","A page-turning psychological mystery that is equal parts horror, humor, and romance, Nevermore is the story of Varen—a Poe fan and Goth—and Isobel—a cheerleader and unlikely heroine. When an English Lit. project pairs the two, Isobel finds herself swept into Varen’s world, one that he has created in his notebook and in his mind, one where the terrifying stories of Edgar Allan Poe come to life. Isobel slowly learns that dreams and words can be much more powerful than she’d ever imagined. As labels of “Goth” and “cheerleader” fade away, Isobel and Varen slip into a consuming romance, braced against the ever-clearer horror that the most chilling realities are those within our own minds. When Isobel has a single chance to rescue Varen from the shadows of his nightmares, will she be able to save him—and herself?     Included in this eBook edition of Nevermore, enjoy a free collection of Edgar Allan Poe’s poems and short stories!",,,Kindle Edition,,564 pages,"

","A l'égal de la princesse de Clèves et de la Sanseverina, la duchesse de Langeais est l'une des grandes divinités féminines de notre littérature. Elle réunit en sa personne le triple prestige de la beauté, de la naissance et du malheur. Issue d'un sang illustre, Antoinette de Navarreins voit le jour en 1794, sous la Terreur, une bien sombre étoile qui sera pour elle la marque du destin. Quelque vingt ans plus tard, séparée de son mari abhorré que lui avait imposé un père indifférent, c'est l'une des gloires mondaines du Faubourg Saint-Germain. Mais que dissimule la coquetterie glacée de cette aristocratique Célimène ? Et par quel étrange sortilège l'incandescente passion d'Armand de Montriveau va-t-elle à son tour la consumer ? Comme tout vrai chef-d'œuvre, ce "" roman noir "" - primitivement intitulé "" Ne touchez pas à la hache "" - est pour partie une autobiographie sublimée, c'est-à-dire le contraire d'un roman à clefs.

","Composed in the twelfth century in north-eastern Iran, Attar's great mystical poem is among the most significant of all works of Persian literature. A marvellous, allegorical rendering of the Islamic doctrine of Sufism - an esoteric system concerned with the search for truth through God - it describes the consequences of the conference of the birds of the world when they meet to begin the search for their ideal king, the Simorgh bird. On hearing that to find him they must undertake an arduous journey, the birds soon express their reservations to their leader, the hoopoe. With eloquence and insight, however, the hoopoe calms their fears, using a series of riddling parables to provide guidance in the search for spiritual truth. By turns witty and profound, The Conference of the Birds transforms deep belief into magnificent poetry.",0140444343,9780140444346),Paperback,Reissue Edition,278 pages,"

","Abdul Khaleq teaches in a crumbling old college in a village in newly independent Bangladesh. His life is mostly on an even keel until he sits down to chronicle his childhood - an endeavour that draws him inexorably into his memories and into an enchanting world somewhere in suburban Calcutta. He remembers the girl who spoke to fish and birds, the girl he first loved. He recalls the stream of visitors to his parents' door those days, some bearing want, some malice and others, generosity and wisdom. As those memories return him to a time when communal tension was gathering force in undivided Bengal and the trauma it brought to his younger self, Khaleq's remembrance stops being a pleasant retreat. He becomes desperately despondent. Khaleq's relentless nostalgia enrages his wife Rekha, who resents his lack of ambition and aloofness. Prodded by the village physician, Doctor Narhari, the couple embark on a boat ride that forces them to confront their discord and desires, and plumb the roots of Abdul Khaleq's alienation.First published in 1977 in Bengali, Black Ice draws on Mahmudul Haque's own experience of Partition to intimately probe the invisible scars bequeathed to the inheritors of Partition.",9844652464,9847012401118),Hardcover,,130 pages,"

","La vida de Albert Espinosa cambió cuando tenía 13 años de edad: le diagnosticaron un cáncer; con 14 años le amputaron la pierna izquierda; a los 16 le quitaron el pulmón izquierda; y ya los 18 le extrajeron parte del hígado. Su enfermedad le enseñó que morir no es triste, que lo triste es no vivir. «Siempre me pareció interesante escribir un libro sobre lo que me enseñó el cáncer y cómo eso se puede aplicar a la vida diaria. Me pareció que ahí había un buen libro. Y eso es loque os intentaré contar en El mundo amarillo. Este no es un libro de autoayuda, no creo mucho en la autoayuda.

","The quintessential Victorian novelist of unforgettable characters caught in their inescapable fates: with unfailing honesty and lyrical writing, Thomas Hardy captured his heroes' intimate relationship with the natural and social environment. Here are three of his finest works, presented in their entirety. Tess of the Durbervilles tells the tragic tale of a poor young girl's coming of age and her traumatic relationships with two men: the wealthy and cold Alec D'Urberville and the beautiful, but unforgiving Angel Clare. Michael Henchard, the title character of The Mayor of Casterbridge, reaches the pinnacles of power-only to lose everything through folly and bad luck. Set in Hardy's beloved Wessex, and always attentive to the struggles of everyday life in the farming community, Far From the Madding Crowd centers on Bathsheba Everdene and the men who love her.",0753705192,9780753705193),Hardcover,,728 pages,"

","When Mephisto’s friend Clayton is called out of town on business, he agrees to look after his slave for the week. But Molly isn’t your average slave. She and Clayton share a serious, full time dynamic. Mephisto feels a weight of responsibility he isn’t used to, and worse, an intense attraction to Molly, the partner of his friend.  Mephisto is determined to sublimate his inappropriate desires and provide a challenging and instructive week for the devoted slave. He subjects Molly to orgasm denial, speech restriction, scenes of erotic torment, even an orgy where she is made to service his friends. Along the way, he experiences unfamiliar jealousy, and deep cravings to possess her himself.  Throughout the week, he is also haunted by persistent questions. Is she happy being a 24/7 slave?

","En 1099 un andrajoso ejército cristiano arrebató Jerusalén a sus amos musulmanes. Aquel puñado de guerreros era todo lo que quedaba de los miles de europeos que, cuatro años antes, habían iniciado un extraordinario peregrinaje a Tierra Santa que conocemos con el nombre de Primera Cruzada. La obra cuenta esa enorme empresa bélica, plagada de visionarios que acudieron a Oriente con la convicción de que el fin de los tiempos estaba próximo y dispuestos a realizar el Apocalipsis en la tierra. Rubenstein nos ofrece un viaje a la Cruzada siguiendo el relato de ese Apocalipsis que los cruzados (parte de ellos) buscaron en la conquista de Jerusalén, que las primeras crónicas e historias del acontecimiento veladamente señalaron en los aproximadamente treinta años posteriores a la consecución de la expedición (y cuando ya sus frutos comenzaban a estar en peligro). Una guerra santa que se percibió entre los cruzados, los francos, de lucha contra un enemigo religioso que aún no había sido percibido como tal, y contra el cual las atrocidades de los asedios de Nicea, especialmente Antioquía, Maarat y Jerusalén, con decapitaciones con un enorme mensaje simbólico e incluso con conatos de episodios de canibalismo (en algún caso, realizado), formaban parte dentro de una construcción mental de los Últimos Días, como reveló el apóstol San Juan en el libro del Apocalipsis (Book of Revelation, en inglés) y que algunos de los predicadores (Pedro el Ermitaño, Pedro Bartolomé, ""descubridor"" de la Lanza Sagrada), algunos de los príncipes (Raimundo de Saint-Gilles entre los más destacados) y muchos de los peregrinos/soldados experimentaron y pusieron en práctica.",,,Hardcover,,448 pages,"

But he doesn't know why he's being stalked by a werewolf with a notebook, why the trees are starting to take back the only safe paths through the Urwald, or why the elves think Jinx and the evil Bonemaster are somehow connected.Jinx's perilous search for answers takes him to the desert land of Samara, where, according to the wizard Simon, he just might find the ancient magic he needs to defeat the Bonemaster and unite the Urwald. But Jinx finds himself in a centuries-old conspiracy that places the Urwald in even greater danger.In this second installment of the Jinx trilogy, Sage Blackwood's daring hero is called upon to save the Urwald. The more he learns, however, the clearer it becomes that this quest will require more than the magic of a solitary wizard's apprentice, and soon he'll have to call upon all of the Urwald-witches, werewolves, wizards, and trees-for help.",0062129937,9780062129932),Hardcover,,390 pages,"

","A fast-paced psychological thriller that explores the explosive consequences of child abuse.On New Year's Eve, 2004, a woman awakens from a coma. She has been unconscious for 12 years since being viciously attacked by a lake. Nobody knows who or why she was assaulted but as the plot unravels it transpires the events of that night are linked to things that happened before the fall of the Berlin Wall.In East Germany in the spring of 1989, 14-year-old Felix Waltz had escaped from a life of abuse at the notorious Stasi youth prison, Torgau. He found a safe haven and went into hiding, leaving a tormented past behind. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, Felix had the chance to live a normal life with his uncle and aunt - until one of Torgau’s abusive wardens turned up, threatening his new-found security and happiness. Felix turned vigilante to confront his past, resorting to murder, and his crimes remain hidden for 12 years.In 2005, Hanne Drais, a criminal psychologist working within a Berlin police team, is one of those involved in reopening the case of Felix’s victims. Hanne discovers the truth behind the lies and finds her destiny with Felix is interwoven with the past, their paths indelibly linked and fated again to collide.The law of the land versus the law of revenge? The answer is often subjective and unclear, but it is never an easy choice....",,,Kindle Edition,,350 pages,"

Per questo motivo si trova di fronte a due amori difficili da riconquistare, da ricostruire: con un padre che forse non c'è mai stato e con una lei che se n'è andata. Forse diventare grandi significa imparare ad amare e a perdonare, fare un lungo viaggio alla ricerca del tempo che abbiamo perso e che non abbiamo più.

Then one cold desert night he picks up a hitchhiker and ends up with something more: a letter from a dying man to the son he hasn’t seen in years. On a quest to deliver the letter, Jimmy travels to Rattlesnake, a small town nestled in the foothills of the California Sierras. The centerpiece of the town is the Rattlesnake Inn, where the bartender is handsome former cowboy Shane Little. Sparks fly, and when Jimmy’s car gives up the ghost, Shane gets him a job as handyman at the inn. Both within the community of Rattlesnake and in Shane’s arms, Jimmy finds an unaccustomed peace. But it can’t be a lasting thing. The open road continues to call, and surely Shane—a strong, proud man with a painful past and a difficult present—deserves better than a lying vagabond who can’t stay put for long.",1634764773,9781634764773),ebook,,240 pages,"

","Jacqueline Woodson, one of today's finest writers, tells the moving story of her childhood in mesmerizing verse.  Raised in South Carolina and New York, Woodson always felt halfway home in each place. In vivid poems, she shares what it was like to grow up as an African American in the 1960s and 1970s, living with the remnants of Jim Crow and her growing awareness of the Civil Rights movement. Touching and powerful, each poem is both accessible and emotionally charged, each line a glimpse into a child’s soul as she searches for her place in the world. Woodson’s eloquent poetry also reflects the joy of finding her voice through writing stories, despite the fact that she struggled with reading as a child. Her love of stories inspired her and stayed with her, creating the first sparks of the gifted writer she was to become. Praise for Jacqueline Woodson:Ms. Woodson writes with a sure understanding of the thoughts of young people, offering a poetic, eloquent narrative that is not simply a story . . . but a mature exploration of grown-up issues and self-discovery.”—The New York Times Book Review ",,,Kindle Edition,,353 pages,"

Savannah is considered a Southern treasure, a city of beauty with a rich, colorful past. Some might even call it magical…
To the uninitiated, Savannah shows only her bright face and genteel manner. Those who know her well, though, can see beyond her colonial trappings and small-city charm to a world where witchcraft is respected, Hoodoo is feared, and spirits linger. Mercy Taylor is all too familiar with the supernatural side of Savannah, being a member of the most powerful family of witches in the South.Despite being powerless herself, of course.Having grown up without magic of her own, in the shadow of her talented and charismatic twin sister, Mercy has always thought herself content. But when a series of mishaps—culminating in the death of the Taylor matriarch—leaves a vacuum in the mystical underpinnings of Savannah, she finds herself thrust into a mystery that could shake her family apart…and unleash a darkness the line of Taylor witches has been keeping at bay for generations.",,,Kindle Edition,,298 pages,"

","What does it mean to mourn today, in a culture that has largely set aside rituals that acknowledge grief? After her mother died of cancer at the age of fifty-five, Meghan O'Rourke found that nothing had prepared her for the intensity of her sorrow. In the first anguished days, she began to create a record of her interior life as a mourner, trying to capture the paradox of grief-its monumental agony and microscopic intimacies-an endeavor that ultimately bloomed into a profound look at how caring for her mother during her illness changed and strengthened their bond.  O'Rourke's story is one of a life gone off the rails, of how watching her mother's illness-and separating from her husband-left her fundamentally altered. But it is also one of resilience, as she observes her family persevere even in the face of immeasurable loss.  With lyricism and unswerving candor, The Long Goodbye conveys the fleeting moments of joy that make up a life, and the way memory can lead us out of the jagged darkness of loss. Effortlessly blending research and reflection, the personal and the universal, it is not only an exceptional memoir, but a necessary one.",1594487987,9781594487989),Hardcover,,306 pages,"

Pero también es un canto a la pureza de lo desconocido, a su amor imposible por China (que en mandarín, 中国, significa «el centro del mundo») y a todo lo que se resiste a ser descifrado. «Es increíble la belleza que esta inconsolable mujer consigue crear con la fealdad del mundo.» Fabienne Darge, Le Monde",,,Paperback,,180 pages,"

","Serafina, Neela, Ling, Ava, Becca, and Astrid, six mermaids from realms scattered throughout the seas and freshwaters, were summoned by the leader of the river witches to learn an incredible truth: the mermaids are direct descendants of the Six Who Ruled-powerful mages who once governed the lost empire of Atlantis. The ancient evil that destroyed Atlantis is stirring again, and only the mermaids can defeat it. To do so, they need to find magical talismans that belonged to the Six. Serafina believes her talisman was buried with an old shipwreck. While researching its location, she is almost discovered by a death rider patrol led by someone familiar. . . . The pain of seeing him turned traitor is devastating.Neela travels to Matali to warn her parents of the grave threat facing their world. But they find her story outlandish; a sign that she needs to be confined to her chamber for rest and recovery. She escapes and travels to Kandina, where her talisman is in the possession of fearsome razormouth dragons. As they hunt for their talismans, both Serafina and Neela find reserves of courage and cunning they didn't know they possessed. They face down danger and death, only to endure a game-changing betrayal, as shocking as a rogue wave.",1423182006,9781423182009),Hardcover,,313 pages,"

C’est avant tout un drame. Qui a fait des morts. D’ailleurs, ça n’était pas censé se finir comme ça. Si vous lisez attentivement, vous vous apercevrez qu’il y avait déjà quelqu’un dans le tableau avant que Juliette n’arrive. Quelqu’un que Roméo aimait beaucoup. Elle s’appelait Rosaline. De l’avis général, Roméo et Juliette, aveuglés par leur passion, ont été les malheureuses victimes du destin. C’est faux. Juliette n’avait rien d’une douce et innocente jeune fille torturée par la fatalité. Elle savait exactement ce qu’elle faisait. Et Roméo ? Roméo avait déjà une âme sœur, moi. Il était fait pour moi.

In a quiet town in the East Valley of Phoenix, Arizona, everything in life is seemingly perfect for eighteen-year-old Kaley Kennedy. She has loving parents, loyal friends, and is dating the hottest boy in school. With only a few months left of her senior year, she’s looking forward to an epic summer before heading off to Los Angeles for college. Without warning, a gorgeous new math teacher interrupts Kaley’s predictable little world, challenging who she is. Suddenly, parties, dates, and Friday nights with her friends seem empty and unfulfilling as she finds herself obsessing over his every move. Desperate for something more, but determined to ignore her fierce attraction, every single relationship in her life begins to crumble by forces beyond her control. Struggling to transition from adolescence to adulthood, Kaley must choose between playing it safe or risking more than just her heart. . . .",,,Kindle Edition,First,422 pages,"

","My First Coup d'Etat chronicles the coming-of-age of John Dramani Mahama in Ghana during the dismal post-independence ""lost decades"" of Africa. He was seven years old when rumors of a coup reached his boarding school in Accra. His father, a minister of state, was suddenly missing, then imprisoned for more than a year. My First Coup d'Etat offers a look at the country that has long been considered Africa's success story. This is a one-of-a-kind book: Mahama's is a rare literary voice from a political leader, and his personal stories work on many levels - as fables, as history, as cultural and political analyses, and, of course, as the memoir of a young man who, unbeknownst to him or anyone else, would grow up to be vice president of his nation. Though nonfiction, these are stories that rise above their specific settings and transport the reader - much like the fiction of Isaac Bashevis Singer and Nadine Gordimer - into a world all their own, one which straddles a time lost and explores the universal human emotions of love, fear, faith, despair, loss, longing, and hope despite all else.",1608198596,9781608198597),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

In this miraculous new translation, acclaimed poet and classicist Anne Carson presents all of Sappho’s fragments, in Greek and in English, as if on the ragged scraps of papyrus that preserve them, inviting a thrill of discovery and conjecture that can be described only as electric—or, to use Sappho’s words, as “thin fire . . . racing under skin.” By combining the ancient mysteries of Sappho with the contemporary wizardry of one of our most fearless and original poets, If Not, Winter provides a tantalizing window onto the genius of a woman whose lyric power spans millennia.",0375724516,9780375724510),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","An evocative and stirring novel about a young woman living in the fascinating and rarely portrayed community of Yemenite Jews of the mid-twentieth century, from the acclaimed author of The Family Orchard.In the tradition of Anita Diamant's The Red Tent, Henna House is the enthralling story of a woman, her family, their community, and the rituals that bind them.Nomi Eve’s vivid saga begins in Yemen in 1920, when Adela Damari’s parents desperately seek a future husband for their young daughter. After passage of the Orphan’s Decree, any unbetrothed Jewish child left orphaned will be instantly adopted by the local Muslim community. With her parents’ health failing, and no spousal prospects in sight, Adela’s situation looks dire until her uncle arrives from a faraway city, bringing with him a cousin and aunt who introduce Adela to the powerful rituals of henna tattooing. Suddenly, Adela’s eyes are opened to the world, and she begins to understand what it means to love another and one’s heritage. She is imperiled, however, when her parents die and a prolonged drought threatens their long-established way of life. She and her extended family flee to the city of Aden where Adela encounters old loves, discovers her true calling, and is ultimately betrayed by the people and customs she once held dear.Henna House is an intimate family portrait and a panorama of history. From the traditions of the Yemenite Jews, to the far-ranging devastation of the Holocaust, to the birth of the State of Israel, Eve offers an unforgettable coming-of-age story and a textured chronicle of a fascinating period in the twentieth century.Henna House is a rich, spirited, and sensuous tale of love, loss, betrayal, forgiveness, and the dyes that adorn the skin and pierce the heart.",1476740305,9781476740300),ebook,,320 pages,"

","""Non c'è posto al mondo che non ami di più della cucina..."" Così comincia il romanzo di Banana Yoshimoto, Kitchen. È un romanzo sulla solitudine giovanile. Le cucine, nuovissime e luccicanti o vecchie e vissute, che riempiono i sogni della protagonista Mikage, rimasta sola al mondo dopo la morte della nonna, rappresentano il calore di una famiglia sempre desiderata. Ma la grande trovata di Banana è che la famiglia si possa, non solo scegliere, ma inventare. Così il padre del giovane amico della protagonista Yūichi può diventare o rivelarsi madre e Mikage può eleggerli come propria famiglia, in un crescendo tragicomico di ambiguità. Con questo romanzo, e il breve racconto che lo chiude, Banana Yoshimoto si è imposta all'attenzione del pubblico italiano mostrando un'immagine del Giappone completamente sconosciuta agli occidentali, con un linguaggio assai fresco e originale che vuole essere una rielaborazione letteraria dello stile dei manga.",8807812436,9788807812439),Paperback,Universale Economica #1243,148 pages,"

","In Müller's fragmented eight-page text, Shakespeare's masterpiece struggles to survive amidst the mounting rubble of literary and political history. Failed ideals and human disillusionment give way in Hamletmachine to the youth clamoring in reaction against the past in order to change the present. To break free of the continual cycle of violence within history the past is questioned and deconstructed. Moving away from psychological narrative, Hamletmachine creates a landscape of the betrayed revolution. Brown's production challenges and provides resistance to this complicated text, inciting spectators to do the same. This performance is an exploration into the place of theatre as a sight of revolutionary change. In Müller's words, ""the slogan of the Napoleonic era still applies: Theater is the Revolution on the march.""",,,,,,,"['Plays', 'Plays', 'Theatre', 'Drama', 'Fiction', 'European Literature', 'German Literature']"

DIVERGENT is a major motion picture in 2014. Divergent: Sixteen-year-old Tris has been forced to make a terrible choice. In a divided society where everyone must conform, Tris does not fit. So she ventures out, alone, determined to find out where she truly belongs. Tris can trust no one in this brutal new world, but she is drawn to a boy who seems to both threaten and protect her.

But Tris's new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature - and of herself - while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice and love.

What is actual when our experiences are mediated by language, technology, medication, and the arts? Is poetry an essential art form, or merely a screen for the reader's projections? Instead of following the dictates of his fellowship, Adam’s ""research"" becomes a meditation on the possibility of the genuine in the arts and beyond: are his relationships with the people he meets in Spain as fraudulent as he fears his poems are?

","Librarian's Note: Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here.A masterful, intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far—a book about the power of storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in Mr. Mercedes“Wake up, genius.” So begins King’s instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn’t published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books, but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel.Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later, a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he’s released from prison after thirty-five years.Not since Misery has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. Finders Keepers is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life—for good, for bad, forever.",1501100130,9781501100130),ebook,,448 pages,"

","Made into a hilarious and timeless film starring Burt Reynolds, Kris Kristofferson, and Jill Clayburgh, and recently named number seven on Sports Illustrated's Top 100 Sports Books of All Time, Semi-Tough is Dan Jenkins's masterpiece and considered by many to be the funniest sports book ever written. The novel follows the outsize adventures of Billy Clyde Puckett, star halfback for the New York Giants, whose team has come to Los Angeles for an epic duel with the despised ""dog-ass"" Jets in the Super Bowl. But Billy Clyde is faced with a dual challenge: not only must he try to run over a bunch of malevolencies incarnate, but he has also been commissioned by a New York book publisher to keep a journal of the events leading up to, including, and following the game. Infused with Dan Jenkins's characteristic joie de vivre and replete with cigarettes, whiskey, and wild women, Semi-Tough is an uproarious romp through a lost era of professional sports that will have any armchair quarterback falling out of his or her recliner in hysterics on a semi-regular basis.",1560258594,9781560258599),Paperback,,318 pages,"

","A year after the publication of The Three Musketeers, Alexandre Dumas produced a sequel worthy in every respect of the original. In Twenty Years After the much beloved D'Artaganan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reunite to fight the forces of evil. In the original novel they defeated Milady, a formidable foe; now they need to face her vengeful son Mordaunt, as well as countering the machinations of the sinister Cardinal Mazarin. Their adventures also take them to England, where Cromwell is about to topple Charles I. Meanwhile, they must overcome the obstacles which the passing of time has placed between them. Rediscovering strength in unity, they fight for Queen and country.The Musketeer novels were a huge success in Dumas' own lifetime, and have lost none of their original appeal. Translated into many languages and adapted for cinema and television, they have helped to make Dumas arguably the most successful exporter of French culture to the wider world.",1840221631,9781840221633),Paperback,,686 pages,"

In ""The Last Rhinos,"" Anthony recounts his attempts to save these animals.The demand for rhino horns in the Far East has turned poaching into a dangerous black market that threatens the lives of not just these rare beasts, but also the rangers who protect them.The northern white rhino's last refuge was in an area controlled by the infamous Lord's Resistance Army, one of the most vicious rebel groups in the world.

","Nell'ottobre del 1928 Virginia Woolf fu invitata a tenere due conferenze sul tema “Le donne e il romanzo”. È l'occasione per elaborare in maniera sistematica le sue molte riflessioni su universo femminile e creatività letteraria. Risultato è questo straordinario saggio, vero e proprio manifesto sulla condizione femminile dalle origini ai giorni nostri, che ripercorre il rapporto donna-scrittura dal punto di vista di una secolare esclusione attraverso la doppia lente del rigore storico e della passione per la letteratura. Come poteva una donna, si chiede la scrittrice inglese, dedicarsi alla letteratura se non possedeva ""denaro e una stanza tutta per sé""? Si snoda così un percorso attraverso la letteratura degli ultimi secoli che, seguendo la simbolica giornata di una scrittrice del nostro tempo, si fa lucida e asciutta riflessione sulla condizione femminile.

He shows up in a new high school in a new town under a new name, makes a few friends, and doesn't stay long. Just long enough for someone in his new friend's family to die-of ""natural causes."" Mission accomplished, Boy Nobody disappears, moving on to the next target.But when he's assigned to the mayor of New York City, things change. The daughter is unlike anyone he has encountered before; the mayor reminds him of his father. And when memories and questions surface, his handlers at The Program are watching. Because somewhere deep inside, Boy Nobody is somebody: the kid he once was; the teen who wants normal things, like a real home and parents; a young man who wants out. And who just might want those things badly enough to sabotage The Program's mission.In this action-packed series debut, author Allen Zadoff pens a page-turning thriller that is as thought-provoking as it is gripping, introducing an utterly original and unforgettable antihero.",,,Kindle Edition,,340 pages,"

","Se esiste il testo sull'amore nella nostra civiltà, a cui ogni testo successivo non può che ricondursi, questo è il Simposio, il dialogo di Platone che più di ogni altro ha mantenuto intatto il fiore della gioventù e ci si offre naturalmente non già come una disputa filosofica, ma come una lunga conversazione - forse la più bella conversazione della letteratura - fra spiriti ""eccellenti"" (oltre a Socrate, il suo grande avversario Aristofane e il bellissimo Alcibiade) che, uno dopo l'altro, prendono la parola e raccontano di una potenza inesauribile: Eros. C'è chi dice che sia il dio più antico, altri invece sostiene che è il dio più giovane, altri che è un grande demone. A tutti esso appare ""meraviglioso fra gli uomini e gli dei"". Le due forme di Afrodite, il mito dell'androgino, le origini dell'antichissimo desiderio di ""fare, di due, uno"" e così di ""guarire la natura umana"", la ""morbidezza"" e l' ""asprezza"" dell'amore, la natura del desiderio: con articolazione sottilissima, attraverso le varie voci, Platone tocca tutti i punti sensibili dell'eros e infine affida a una vera iniziatrice ai ""misteri d'amore"", Diotima, il compito di schiuderne i segreti ultimi. E qui, come pure nell'ultima, trascinante apparizione di Alcibiade, diventano espliciti, forse più di altre volte in Platone, i riferimenti alla ""sapienza"" e all' ""enigma"". Anche per questo, dunque, Giorgio Colli è stato interprete profondamente congeniale di questo testo, in cui risuonano, limpidi e misteriosi, alcuni temi che sono stati centrali per la sua interpretazione del mondo greco.",8845903915,9788845903915),Paperback,Piccola Biblioteca Adelphi #81,108 pages,"

","Este romance de Laxness, Nobel da Literatura, tem lugar na Islândia, no início do século XX, numa sociedade de servidão e num país com uma natureza inclemente. É a saga de Bjartur, um homem obstinado, inquebrável e inesquecível. Bjar­tur vive no limiar da auto-suficiência e conta apenas com a sua obstinação e força interior, rejeitando qualquer caridade. Vive num vale com reputação de assombrado, só confia no seu rebanho, no seu cão e no seu cavalo. Se alguém toca o seu coração é Asta, a sua filha, mas tudo muda quando ela o desilude e magoa os seus enraizados princípios de honra…A determinação de Bjartur e a sua luta pela independência são genuinamente heróicas, assustadoras e chegam a ser cómicas. Gente independente é uma história épica, ao mesmo tempo trágica e bela. É uma imensa viagem por um mundo onde as almas são levadas até ao precipício e só os mais duros resistem. Um romance imbuído de sentido de humor, de uma crueldade que roça o violento e de uma profunda humanidade. Um romance que continua a comover gerações de leitores.",,,Paperback,,556 pages,"

","It's not just the motion of the ocean, ladies. It's definitely the SIZE of the boat too. And I've got both firing on all cylinders. In fact, I have ALL the right assets. Looks, brains, my own money, and a big c&$k. You might think I'm an as%*$le. I sound like one, don’t I? I'm hot as sin, rich as heaven, smart as hell and hung like a horse. Guess what? You haven't heard my story before. Sure, I might be a playboy, like the NY gossip rags call me. But I’m the playboy who’s actually a great guy. Which makes me one of a kind. The only trouble is, my dad needs me to cool it for a bit. With conservative investors in town wanting to buy his flagship Fifth Avenue jewelry store, he needs me not only to zip it up, but to look the part of the committed guy. Fine. I can do this for Dad. After all, I’ve got him to thank for the family jewels. So I ask my best friend and business partner to be my fiancée for the next week. Charlotte’s up for it. She has her own reasons for saying yes to wearing this big rock. And pretty soon all this playing pretend in public leads to no pretending whatsoever in the bedroom, because she just can’t fake the kind of toe-curling, window-shattering orgasmic cries she makes as I take her to new heights between the sheets.  But I can’t seem to fake that I might be feeling something real for her.  What the hell have I gotten myself into with this…big rock?

","Everybody needs to run away from home at least once. Susan Corbett told people she was out to save the world, but really she was running--running from her home as much as to anywhere. Like many women, she was searching for meaning to her life or for a good man to share it with. In Africa, she hoped to find both.  Compelling and compassionate, In the Belly of the Elephant is Susan's transformative story of what happens when you decide to try to achieve world peace while you're searching for a good man. More than a fish-out-of-water story, it's a surprising and heart-rending account of her time in Africa trying to change the world as she battles heat, sandstorms, drought, riots, intestinal bugs, burnout, love affairs and more than one meeting with death. Against a backdrop of vivid beauty and culture, in a narrative interwoven with a rich tapestry of African myths and fables, Susan learns the true simplicity of life, and discovers people full of kindness, wisdom and resilience, and shares with us lessons we, too, can learn from her experiences.",,,Kindle Edition,,291 pages,"

","Ray Bradbury, the undisputed Dean of American storytelling, dips his accomplished pen into the cryptic inkwell of noir and creates a stylish and slightly fantastical tale of mayhem and murder set among the shadows and the murky canals of Venice, California, in the early 1950s.Toiling away amid the looming palm trees and decaying bungalows, a struggling young writer (who bears a resemblance to the author) spins fantastic stories from his fertile imagination upon his clacking typewriter. Trying not to miss his girlfriend (away studying in Mexico), the nameless writer steadily crafts his literary effort--until strange things begin happening around him.Starting with a series of peculiar phone calls, the writer then finds clumps of seaweed on his doorstep. But as the incidents escalate, his friends fall victim to a series of mysterious ""accidents""--some of them fatal. Aided by Elmo Crumley, a savvy, street-smart detective, and a reclusive actress of yesteryear with an intense hunger for life, the wordsmith sets out to find the connection between the bizarre events, and in doing so, uncovers the truth about his own creative abilities.",0380789655,9780380789658),Paperback,,240 pages,"

The brutal murder of two teenage girls on the last day of Nora Cunningham's junior year in high school throws Nora into turmoil. Her certainties, friendships, religion, her prudence, her resolve to find a boyfriend taller than she is - are shaken or cast off altogether. Most people in Elmgrove, Maryland, share the comforting conviction that Buddy Novak, who had every reason to want his ex-girlfriend dead, is responsible for the killings. Nora agrees at first, then begins to doubt Buddy's guilt, and finally comes to believe him innocent - the lone dissenting voice in Elmgrove.Told from several different perspectives, including that of the murderer, Mister Death's Blue-Eyed Girls is a suspenseful page-turner with a powerful human drama at its core.",0547760620,9780547760629),Hardcover,,330 pages,"

","This wonderful novel tells the story of seventeen-year-old Cassandra and her extraordinary family, who live in not-so-genteel poverty in a ramshackle old English castle. Cassandra's eccentric father is a writer whose first book took the literary world by storm but he has since failed to write a single word and now spends most of his time reading detective novels from the village library.Cassandra's elder sister, Rose - exquisitely beautiful, vain and bored - despairs of her family's circumstances and determines to marry their affluent American landlord, Simon regardless of the fact she does not love him. She is in turns helped and hindered in this by their bohemian step-mother Topaz, an artist's model and nudist who likes to commune with nature. Finally there is Stephen, dazzlingly handsome and hopelessly in love with Cassandra.Amidst this maelstrom Cassandra strives to hone her writing skills. She fills three notebooks with sharply funny yet poignant entries, which candidly chronicle the great changes that take place within the castle's walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has captured the heart of the reader in one of literature's most enchanting entertainments",0099439743,9780099439745),Paperback,,410 pages,"

","As the western world’s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden has fought to keep his personal life a mystery – loyalty and fear keeping those who know him from speaking out – until now.For the first time, two of Osama’s closest family members, his first wife Najwa and their fourth son Omar, go behind the headlines to reveal the truth about the character and life of a man feared and revered around the globe. In gripping detail, they recount the drama, tensions, and everyday activities of the man they knew as a husband and father. Married at fifteen, Najwa describes the transformation of the quiet, serious young man she fell in love with into an authoritarian husband and stern father, an entrepreneur, and – finally – the leader of a complex international terrorist network. Uprooted from a life of extraordinary luxury and privilege in Saudi Arabia, they suddenly found themselves living life on the run, fleeing from country to country under assumed names and fake passports. Omar describes how he and his siblings were brought up in remote ranches and fortified Afghani mountain camps, handling Kalashnikovs and learning desert survival skills. Their eventual escape from Afghanistan would come just days before the terrible events of 9/11 changed the world forever. With unprecedented access and exclusive family photographs, Jean Sasson, author of the bestselling Princess, presents the story that we were never meant to hear.",,,Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Torn from their homeland, two Jewish sisters find refuge in Sweden.It's the summer of 1939. Two Jewish sisters from Vienna—12-year-old Stephie Steiner and 8-year-old Nellie—are sent to Sweden to escape the Nazis. They expect to stay there six months, until their parents can flee to Amsterdam; then all four will go to America. But as the world war intensifies, the girls remain, each with her own host family, on a rugged island off the western coast of Sweden.Nellie quickly settles in to her new surroundings. She’s happy with her foster family and soon favors the Swedish language over her native German. Not so for Stephie, who finds it hard to adapt; she feels stranded at the end of the world, with a foster mother who’s as cold and unforgiving as the island itself. Her main worry, though, is her parents—and whether she will ever see them again.Book Details:

And what difference does it make to us as humans living our everyday lives? In this wholly original blend of science, story, myth, and memoir, Haupt draws us into the secret world of the wild creatures that dwell among us in our urban neighborhoods, whether we are aware of them or not.

","This is the first published version of the novel that allows readers to hear Marlow's voice as Conrad himself heard it as he wrote the story. The editor, Robert Kimbrough, has completely re-edited the text—missing words have been restored, and the entire novel has been repunctuated in accordance with Conrad's own style.New to ""Backgrounds"" is the story of George Washington Williams, a black American who was in the Congo at the same time as Conrad. Acting on his own, Williams sent detailed reports on conditions in the Congo to both president Benjamin Harrison and Belgium's King Leopold II. Williams's writings, along with John Hope Franklin's commentary on Williams, present a good basis for comparison with and contrast Conrad. Also included are historical backgrounds to the Congo/Zaire, from the late nineteenth century to the present.Critical interpretation of the novel is wide ranging and includes newly chosen essays by Third World writers Chinua Achebe, Wilson Harris, Francis B. Singh, C.P. Sarvan; varied commentary on the film

","Natalie Wood was always a star; her mother made sure this was true. A superstitious Russian immigrant who claimed to be royalty, Maria had been told by a gypsy, long before little Natasha Zakharenko's birth, that her second child would be famous throughout the world. When the beautiful child with the hypnotic eyes was first placed in Maria's arms, she knew the prophecy would become true and proceeded to do everything in her power — everything — to make sure of it.Natasha is the haunting story of a vulnerable and talented actress whom many of us felt we knew. We watched her mature on the movie screen before our eyes — in Miracle on 34th Street, Rebel Without a Cause, West Side Story, Splendor in the Grass, and on and on. She has been hailed — along with Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor — as one of the top three female movie stars in the history of film, making her a legend in her own lifetime and beyond. But the story of what Natalie endured, of what her life was like when the doors of the soundstages closed, has long been obscured.Natasha is based on years of exhaustive research into Natalie's turbulent life and mysterious drowning in the dark water that was her greatest fear. Author Suzanne Finstad, a former lawyer, conducted nearly four hundred interviews with Natalie's family, close friends, legendary costars, lovers, film crews, and virtually everyone connected with the investigation of her strange death. Through these firsthand accounts from many who have never spoken publicly before, Finstad has reconstructed a life of emotional abuse and exploitation, of almost unprecedented fame, great loneliness, poignancy, and loss. She sheds an unwavering light on Natalie's complex relationships with James Dean, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Raymond Burr, Warren Beatty, and Robert Wagner and reveals the two lost loves of Natalie's life, whom her controlling mother prevented her from marrying. Finstad tells this beauty's heartbreaking story with sensitivity and grace, revealing a complex and conflicting mix of fragility and strength in a woman who was swept along by forces few could have resisted. Natasha is impossible to put down — it is the definitive biography of Natalie Wood that we've long been waiting for.",0609809571,9780609809570),Paperback,,544 pages,"

","Maus (""rato"", em alemão) é a história de Vladek Spiegelman, judeu-polonês que sobreviveu ao campo de concentração de Auschwitz, narrada por ele próprio ao filho Art. O livro é considerado um clássico contemporâneo das histórias em quadrinhos. Foi publicado em duas partes, a primeira em 1986 e a segunda em 1991. No ano seguinte, Maus ganhou o prestigioso Prêmio Pulitzer de literatura. A obra é um sucesso estrondoso de público e de crítica. Desde que foi lançada, tem sido objeto de estudos e análises de especialistas de diversas áreas -história, literatura, artes e psicologia. Em nova tradução, o livro é agora relançado com as duas partes reunidas num só volume. Nas tiras, os judeus são desenhados como ratos e os nazistas ganham feições de gatos; poloneses não-judeus são porcos e americanos, cachorros. Esse recurso, aliado à ausência de cor dos quadrinhos, reflete o espírito do livro: trata-se de um relato incisivo e perturbador, que evidencia a brutalidade da catástrofe do Holocausto. Spiegelman, porém, evita o sentimentalismo e interrompe algumas vezes a narrativa para dar espaço a dúvidas e inquietações. É implacável com o protagonista, seu próprio pai, retratado como valoroso e destemido, mas também como sovina, racista e mesquinho. De vários pontos de vista, uma obra sem equivalente no universo dos quadrinhos e um relato histórico de valor inestimável.",8535906282,9788535906288),Paperback,,296 pages,"

Con la straordinaria capacità di reinventare l'esperienza, Hemingway ci restituisce un'umanità varia e vibrante - uomini, donne e adolescenti chiamati tutti a misurarsi in modo diverso con l'asprezza dell'esistenza -; ora raccontandoci di matadores e corride, di safari dall'esito tragico, di pugili indomabili e di donne fragili e remissive; ora narrando le avventure del suo alter-ego Nick Adams, la passione per la pesca alle trote, le prime delusioni amorose; ora infine tornando con lucidità alla devastante esperienza della guerra combattuta sul campo o nelle retrovie. Nutrono questi racconti tutti i motivi più cari alla saga hemingwayana, narrati con tale intensità che «quando tu hai finito di leggerne uno ti sembrerà che tutto questo sia accaduto a te e, dopo, tutto quanto ti appartiene: il bene e il male, l'estasi, il rimorso e il dolore, la gente, i posti e il tempo che faceva».",8806152246,9788806152246),Paperback,ET Scrittori,536 pages,"

","This is the 9th Avon printing.Ursula K. Le Guin is one of science fiction's greatest writers. She is also an acclaimed author of powerful and perceptive nonfiction, fantasy, and literary fiction. She has received many honors, including six Nebula and five Hugo Awards, the National Book Award, the Pushcart Prize, the Newbery, the Pilgrim, the Tiptree, and citations by the American Library Association. She has written over a dozen highly regarded novels and story collections. Her SF masterworks are The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), The Dispossessed (1974), and The Lathe of Heaven (1971). George Orr has dreams that come true--dreams that change reality. He dreams that the aunt who is sexually harassing him is killed in a car crash, and wakes to find that she died in a wreck six weeks ago, in another part of the country. But a far darker dream drives George into the care of a psychotherapist--a dream researcher who doesn't share George's ambivalence about altering reality. The Lathe of Heaven is set in the sort of worlds that one would associate with Philip K. Dick, but Ms. Le Guin's treatment of the material, her plot and characterization and concerns, are more akin to the humanistic, ethically engaged, psychologically nuanced fiction of Theodore Sturgeon. The Lathe of Heaven is an insightful and chilling examination of total power, of war and injustice and other age-old problems, of changing the world, of playing God. --Cynthia Ward",0380435470,9780380435470),Mass Market Paperback,#43547,175 pages,"

","Egy test, két lélek és minden idők legizgalmasabb szerelmi háromszöge egy olyan világban, ahol az egész emberiség jövője a tét.A Földet elfoglalta a világűrből érkező idegen faj, amelynek tagjai irányításuk alá vonják az emberek elméjét, miközben testüket érintetlenül hagyják. Az emberiség túlnyomó része feladta, az ő testük már csak egy burok.A betolakodók a Földet paradicsommá változtatták. Saját maguk számára. Amikor egy nagyhírű, különc, világról világra vándorló lélek érkezik a bolygóra, az utolsó lázadók egyikének testét kapja ittlétéhez. A Vándor, aki Melanie Stryder testébe költözik, ismeri a nehézségeket amelyekkel szembe kell néznie egy emberi burokban élve. Egyvalamire azonban nem készült fel: hogy új testének előző lakója nemhogy nem költözött ki a burokból, de egyenesen visszaköveteli a tulajdonát. Melanie megtölti a Vándor elméjét az emlékeivel és képekkel a szerelméről, aki egy távoli helyen bujkál, és még mindig nem adta fel a harcot az idegenek ellen. Mivel a Vándor képtelen ellenállni a rátörő érzelmeknek, vágyakozni kezd a férfi után, akivel még soha nem találkozott. Aztán egy váratlan fordulatnak köszönhetően Melanie és a Vándor szövetségesekké válnak, és a két lélek ugyanabban a burokban vág neki az arizonai sivatagnak, hogy megtalálják a férfit, akibe mindketten szerelmesek…",,,Hardcover,,519 pages,"

He also teaches us how to swim safely in the ocean by reading the tides and currents and respecting all the inhabitants. Here are the lessons Peter has learned, the mistakes he has made, the danger he has faced—and the spectacular sights he has seen in the world’s largest environment.

","Hailed as one of the world's supreme masterpieces on the subject of death and dying, The Death of Ivan Ilyich is the story of a worldly careerist, a high court judge who has never given the inevitability of his death so much as a passing thought. But one day death announces itself to him, and to his shocked surprise he is brought face to face with his own mortality. How, Tolstoy asks, does an unreflective man confront his one and only moment of truth?This short novel was the artistic culmination of a profound spiritual crisis in Tolstoy's life, a nine-year period following the publication of Anna Karenina during which he wrote not a word of fiction. A thoroughly absorbing and, at times, terrifying glimpse into the abyss of death, it is also a strong testament to the possibility of finding spiritual salvation.",0553210351,9780553210354),Paperback,Bantam Classic Reissue,134 pages,"

","“You can’t convict what you can’t confirm.” That’s the motto of 12-year-old Jaxter Grimjinx and his infamous family of thieves. And while Jaxter may not have his father’s burglary prowess, his mother’s forgery skills, or his little sister’s mastery of sleight-of-hand, his book-fed knowledge of non-magical solutions to magical problems makes him invaluable to the family’s heists.But the Grimjinxes may have pulled one con too many in their hometown, Vengekeep. After swapping the prophetic tapestry used to guide Vengekeep’s actions for a fake concocted by Jaxter’s mother, the Grimjinxes are stunned when the false prophecies begin coming true, bringing destruction in their wake.Suddenly, Vengekeep is besieged by “natural” disasters and rampaging monsters, courtesy of the secretly enchanted counterfeit tapestry. With his family forced to stay and combat the impending doom, Jaxter must leave his hometown in search of a way to keep the increasingly dangerous prophecies from wiping Vengekeep off the map.",0062049283,9780062049285),Hardcover,,397 pages,"

","Flamboyant, mercurial Alistair Dodge and steadfast, cautious Roger Sansarc are second cousins who are both gay and whose lifelong friendship begins when they first meet as nine-year-old boys in 1954. At crucial moments in their personal histories their lives intersect, and each discovers his own unique - and uniquely gay- identity. Through the lends of their complex, tumultuous, yet enduring relationship - and their involvement with the handsome model, poet and decorated Vietnam vet Matt Loguidice, whom they both love - Felice Picano chronicles and celebrates gay life and subculture over the last half of the twentieth century. From Malibu Beach in its palmist surfer days to the legendary parties at Fire Island Pines in the 1970s, from San Francisco during its gayest era to AIDS activism in Greenwich Village in the 1990s, Like People in History presents 'the heroic and funny saga of the last three decades by someone who saw everything and forgot nothing' (Edmund White).",0349108382,9780349108384),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","The Insulted & Injured, published soon after Dostoevsky's political imprisonment, clearly foreshadows his later preoccupation with unconscious psychological drives & their external effects on the lives of his characters. Where his later works carry these drives to inevitably dramatic conclusions, The Insulted & Injured confines them within the smaller boundaries of everyday event. In this story the impulse toward self-abnegation in love, which appears so markedly in both Vanya & Natasha, isn't itself enough to direct their lives; instead, it combines with their social world & the mundane ambitions of Prince Valkovsky to defeat their hope of happiness. Of all the characters in the novel, only Natasha's lover, the Prince's son Alyosha-the person least driven to mold life to his own terms-emerges untouched. Here are, to a greater extent than in Dostoevsky's more familiar works, flesh-&-blood people as we see them around every day. They are made up of both good & evil, of will & acceptance. Unfailingly they command interest & illuminate understanding.",,,,,,,"['Classics', 'Cultural', 'Russia', 'Literature', 'Russian Literature', 'Fiction', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literature', '19th Century', 'Drama', 'Classics', 'Classic Literature', 'Psychology']"

They keep him company during the long journey to Russia. They keep him alive - through hunger, pain, and despair - during his time in the brutal Soviet labour camp. And, eventually, they will bring him back home.In this new novel, Herta Muller calls upon her unique combination of poetic intensity and detached precision to conjure the distorted world of that Soviet camp. There, the heart is reduced to a pump, the breath mechanized to the rhythm of a swinging shovel, and coal, sand, and cement have a will of their own. Hunger becomes an insatiable angel who haunts the camp, but also a bare-knuckled sparring partner, delivering blows that keep Leo feeling the rawest connection to life.Muller has distilled Leo's struggle into words of breathtaking intensity that take us on a journey far beyond one man's physical travails and into the depths of the human soul.",3899036867,9783899036862),Audio CD,,,"

","So, then. You want a story and I will tell you one...Afghanistan, 1952. Abdullah and his sister Pari live with their father and stepmother in the small village of Shadbagh. Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their heads touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, with profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways in which we help our loved ones in need, how the choices we make resonate through history and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.",1594632383,9781594632389),Paperback,,421 pages,"

","Toujours plus loin. Toujours plus au nord. Toujours plus seul. Inspiré par ses lectures de Tolstoï et de Thoreau, Christopher McCandless a tout sacrifié à son idéal de pureté et de nature. En 1990, une fois son diplôme universitaire en poche, il offre ses économies à une association caritative et part, sans un adieu, vers son destin. Celui-ci s'achèvera tragiquement au coeur des forêts de l'Alaska...

","Disziplin, so hat die Erfahrung den langjährigen Schulleiter des Internats Salem, Bernhard Bueb, gelehrt, ist das Tor zum Glück. Sie, so seine These, bildet das Rückgrat einer jeden guten, das heißt: gelingenden Erziehung. Erst durch sie und mit ihr der Fähigkeit, Autorität (und Autoritäten) anzuerkennen, auf die unmittelbare Befriedigung eines jeden Bedürfnisses zu verzichten und Verantwortung zu übernehmen, werden junge Menschen in die Lage versetzt, ein tatsächlich selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen -- was ja unbestritten eines der vorrangigen Ziele von Erziehung darstellt. Seiner Streitschrift, die dem überkommenen Laisser-faire-Leitbild der 68-erPädagogen das Scheitern attestiert, hat der Autor einen Fontane-Vers vorangestellt, der den Kern seines Erziehungskonzepts auf den Punkt bringt: Freiheit freilich. Aber zum Schlimmen. / Führt der Masse sich selbst Bestimmen. / Und das Klügste, das Beste, Bequemste / Das auch freien Seelen weitaus Genehmste / Heißt doch schließlich, ich hab's nicht Hehl: / Festes Gesetz und fester Befehl! Manches Elternohr wird bei solchen Worten erröten. Und dies aus guten Gründen. Das weiß natürlich auch Bernhard Bueb, der auch um die Ursache für solcherlei Unbehagen nur zu genau weiß: Zutiefst erschüttert wurde die pädagogische Kultur in Deutschland durch den Nationalsozialismus, der im Anschluss an den Kadavergehorsam der kaiserlichen Kadettenanstalten Begriffe wie Disziplin und Autorität in der pädagogischen Praxis vollends pervertierte. Die 68-er-Pädagogik war der Pendelschlag in die Richtung des anderen Extrems, der scheinbar völligen Beliebigkeit. Gegen diese Beliebigkeit zieht Bueb bei aller Irritation, die seine provokant klingenden Thesen bei vielen Lesern hervorrufen wird, mit guten Gründen zu Felde. Wir wünschen dem Autor jedenfalls, dass sein Lob der Disziplin eine heftige Debatte auslöst. Schließlich ist das der Sinn einer jeden Streitschrift. Aus unserer Sicht jedenfalls: Unbedingt lesenswert! -- Hasso Greb",3548369308,9783548369303),Paperback,,173 pages,"

","Maia ist die älteste von sechs Schwestern, die alle von ihrem Vater adoptiert wurden, als sie sehr klein waren. Sie lebt als Einzige noch auf dem herrschaftlichen Anwesen ihres Vaters am Genfer See, denn anders als ihre Schwestern, die es drängte, draußen in der Welt ein ganz neues Leben als Erwachsene zu beginnen, fand die eher schüchterne Maia nicht den Mut, ihre vertraute Umgebung zu verlassen. Doch das ändert sich, als ihr Vater überraschend stirbt und ihr einen Umschlag hinterlässt – und sie plötzlich den Schlüssel zu ihrer bisher unbekannten Vorgeschichte in Händen hält: Sie wurde in Rio de Janeiro in einer alten Villa geboren, deren Adresse noch heute existiert. Maia fasst den Entschluss, nach Rio zu fliegen, und an der Seite von Floriano Quintelas, eines befreundeten Schriftstellers, beginnt sie, das Rätsel ihrer Herkunft zu ergründen. Dabei stößt sie auf eine tragische Liebesgeschichte in der Vergangenheit ihrer Familie, und sie taucht ein in das mondäne Paris der Jahrhundertwende, wo einst eine schöne junge Frau aus Rio einem französischen Bildhauer begegnete. Und erst jetzt fängt Maia an zu begreifen, wer sie wirklich ist und was dies für ihr weiteres Leben bedeutet ...",3442313945,9783442313945),Hardcover,,544 pages,"

","Debut novelist Simon Kurt Unsworth sends the detective novel to Hell. In The Devil's Detective, a sea change is coming to Hell . . . and a man named Thomas Fool is caught in the middle.    Thomas Fool is an Information Man, an investigator tasked with cataloging and filing reports on the endless stream of violence and brutality that flows through Hell. His job holds no reward or satisfaction, because Hell has rules but no justice. Each new crime is stamped ""Do Not Investigate"" and dutifully filed away in the depths of the Bureaucracy. But when an important political delegation arrives and a human is found murdered in a horrific manner—extravagant even by Hell's standards—everything changes. The murders escalate, and their severity points to the kind of killer not seen for many generations. Something is challenging the rules and order of Hell, so the Bureaucracy sends Fool to identify and track down the killer. . . . But how do you investigate murder in a place where death is common currency? Or when your main suspect pool is a legion of demons? With no memory of his past and only an irresistible need for justice, Fool will piece together clues and follow a trail that leads directly into the heart of a dark and chaotic conspiracy. A revolution is brewing in Hell . . . and nothing is what it seems.The Devil's Detective is an audacious, highly suspenseful thriller set against a nightmarish and wildly vivid world. Simon Kurt Unsworth has created a phantasmagoric thrill ride filled with stunning set pieces and characters that spring from our deepest nightmares. It will have readers of both thrillers and horror hanging on by their fingernails until the final word. In Hell, hope is your worst enemy.",0385539347,9780385539340),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Alternate-Cover Edition for this ASIN can be found hereSlaughterhouse-Five is the story of Billy Pilgrim, an ill-trained American soldier and his experience in World War IIWar is inevitable, and it is absurd. The main theme of the book focuses on this. Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner-of-war at the hands of the Germans. He is captured and put in a disused slaughterhouse, which eventually proves to be a safe ‘shelter’ when his life is spared during the bombing of Dresden.Billy is a fatalist. Barely out of childhood, his lack of enthusiasm for war and the eventual consequences of the war on his life is what makes up the story of Billy’s life. Vonnegut uses Billy to show that war is unnecessarily glorified, due to which people overlook the real tragedies and trauma that war actually brings with it.Billy’s journey through time and space, his accounts of the bombing at Dresden, and his life as a prisoner of war, all highlight the central theme in the novel, war is nothing but another form of hell. Dark humour and irony is what makes Slaughterhouse-Five unique and a perfect example of creative accomplishment. It conveys the bitterness of war, while providing comic relief along with crucial understanding of the working of the human mind.",,,Kindle Edition,ISBN: 9780795302664,285 pages,"

","Beside Myself is a literary thriller about identical twins, Ellie and Helen, who swap places aged six. At first it is just a game, but then Ellie refuses to swap back. Forced into her new identity, Helen develops a host of behavioural problems, delinquency and chronic instability. With their lives diverging sharply, one twin headed for stardom and the other locked in a spiral of addiction and mental illness, how will the deception ever be uncovered? Exploring questions of identity, selfhood, and how other people's expectations affect human behaviour, this novel is as gripping as it is psychologically complex.",1632864339,9781632864338),Hardcover,,315 pages,"

","Vysoko v kopcích Bílých Karpat jsou řídce rozeseta přikrčená stavení. Všude je daleko. Říká se, že právě proto si tam některé ženy dokázaly uchovat vědomosti a intuici, kterou jsme ztratili. Předávaly si ji z generace na generaci řadu století. Říkali jim bohyně, protože dokázaly bohovat — prosit Boha o pomoc. A jeho zásahům i trošku dopomoci… Říkalo se o nich, že vidí do budoucnosti. Proč tedy nezachránily tu svou?Dora Idesová je poslední z bohyní. Brání se přijmout zastaralý způsob života a věštit příchozím z odlitého vosku jako její teta Surmena. Vše se ovšem mění, jakmile pochopí, že co se v jejím životě zdálo být nešťastnou shodou okolností, bylo pečlivě promyšleným plánem. Její umístění v internátě, Jakoubkova ústavní péče, hospitalizace v psychiatrické léčebně v Kroměříži… Na konci 90. let na ni v pardubickém archivu ministerstva vnitra čeká operativní svazek vedený StB na vnitřního nepřítele — její tetu Surmenu. Dora nevěřícně rozplétá neznámé osudy své rodiny i dalších bohyní…Byly bohyně nebezpečím pro důvěřivé pacienty? Nebo byly skutečně ideologickou hrozbou normalizované společnosti? Nebo se o vyhlazení posledního reliktu pohanství postarala obyčejná závist a lidská zášť? Nový román Kateřiny Tučkové, autorky bestselleru Vyhnání Gerty Schnirch, je fascinujícím příběhem o ženské duši, magii a zasuté části naší historie.",,,Hardcover,,455 pages,"

","Will man den Wehrdienst verweigern und Zivildienst ableisten, dann sollte man in der Gewissensprüfung darlegen können, warum man sich denn keinen Dienst an der Waffe vorstellen kann. Und mehr als einmal dürfte dann als Begründung die Lektüre von Erich Maria Remarques Im Westen nicht Neues folgen. Dieser Roman schildert aufs Eindringlichste die schauerlichen Erlebnisse des Soldaten Paul Bäumer an der Westfront des Ersten Weltkrieges, wo sich Deutsche und Alliierte in einem grausamen Grabenkrieg gegenüberstanden. Aber eigentlich sind Schauplatz und Zeit bedeutungslos, beherrschend ist das sinnlose Töten und die zu reinem Menschenmaterial degradierten Soldaten, die schon lange den Glauben an den ""gerechten Krieg"" aufgegeben haben. Hier ist kein Platz für klischeehaft mutige Helden, Verlierer sind sie letztlich alle, die da im Schlamm der Schützengräben liegen. So mancher Leser wird nach diesem Roman seine Meinung zu Krieg und Militärdienst geändert haben. Wer heute noch glaubt, Krieg könne eine heldenhafte Sache sein, der kennt das Buch wahrscheinlich nicht und sollte einmal einen Blick hinein werfen. Danach ist er entweder eines besseren belehrt oder scheinbar schon völlig abgestumpft. --Joachim Hohwieler",346202731X,9783462027310),Paperback,,221 pages,"

","From the New York Times bestselling author of Beach Colors and Breakwater Bay comes this unforgettable story—reminiscent of Kristin Hannah’s beloved novels—of friends, loyalty, and love as three women who are reunited in the idyllic beach town where they grew up are forced to re-evaluate their bondsFifteen years ago, seventeen-year-old Vanessa Moran fell in love and lost her virginity but not to the same boy. Pregnant, desperate, and humiliated, she fled friends and family and Whisper Beach, New Jersey, never breathing a word about her secret to anyone. She hasn’t been back since. Now a professional Manhattan organizer, she returns to the funeral of her best friend’s husband. She intends on just paying her respects and leaving—though she can’t deny she also wants the town to see how far she’s come as a successful business woman. But her plans to make this a short visit fall by the wayside when her girlfriends have other ideas. Dorie, the owner of the pier’s Blue Crab Restaurant where Van and her friends worked as teenagers, needs help. Dorie’s roving husband spends every penny they make and now their restaurant is failing. Joe, the boy Van left behind without an explanation, has never stopped loving her. While he’s wary of getting hurt again, he also can’t help wondering what would happen if they took up where they left off. As the summer progresses and the restaurant takes on a new look, trouble comes from unexpected sources. For Van, this summer will test the meaning of friendship and trust—and how far love can bend before it breaks.",0062319167,9780062319166),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Ali al Shihabi analyzes the two most dangerous political fault lines running across the Middle East today: the Arab-Israeli conflict and Arabian-Iranian tensions.In Arabian War Games, the author proposes, through the use of fiction, a scenario where these issues all come to head in an explosive climax.It is 2016, and the regime in Iran, by then nearly choking to death under sanctions, attempts to cut the noose around its neck by invading Arabia in collusion with its ally Iraq. At the same time, Israeli elites, increasingly obsessed with preserving their Jewish majority and visualizing the “Jewish state” as slowly drowning in a sea of Arabs, conclude that the time has come to forcibly expel their rapidly growing Israeli-Arab minority into Jordan. The U.S., fatigued by Middle East wars, confused by Iraq’s collusion with Iran, overwhelmed by the resultant collapse of global financial markets, and impotent in front of a determined Israel, helplessly watches events play out.Eschewing the tendency of professional predictors to avoid forecasting the “outlandish,” Shihabi explores these potential scenarios in a granular fashion, paying particular attention to the mind-set and thinking of the ruling elites who are driving these events.Far from mere sensationalism, Arabian War Games is a careful analysis of the stress points currently at play in the region. Not only does Shihabi dissect these fault lines and their possible outcomes with incisiveness, he also proposes alternative, creative solutions, in the hopes that such scenarios can be avoided.",,,Kindle Edition,,201 pages,"

Destinadas a esta empresa suprema, viven enclaustradas y reducidas a ser un cuerpo con una única misión: reproducirse.""Debemos recordar que no hay nada nuevo en la sociedad descrita en ""El cuento de la criada"" excepto el tiempo y el lugar.

As a writer who finds inspiration with Hemingway in Paris and Virginia Woolf in London, as a spy recruited by Ian Fleming and betrayed in the war and as an art-dealer in '60s New York, Logan mixes with the movers and shakers of his times. But as a son, friend, lover and husband, he makes the same mistakes we all do in our search for happiness.

An unlikely candidate is appointed to replace him: Juliette, a mechanic with no training in law, whose special knack is fixing machines. Now Juliette is about to be entrusted with fixing her silo, and she will soon learn just how badly her world is broken.

","We bevinden ons in de tijd na de Grote Overstromingen. Het land is verdeeld in veilige, droge gebieden, en terreinen die gevaar lopen als het water weer stijgt. Ook de bevolking leeft strikt gescheiden: de Drogen vormen de rijke elite, de Natten het werkvolk dat een hard bestaan leidt om te overleven – en van waaruit steeds sterker verzet optreedt.Nina is een Droge, de dochter van de Gouverneur. Tijdens de laatste overstroming is haar school getroffen en haar zusje verdronken. Daardoor is ze gedwongen om, zij het onder een andere naam, lessen te volgen op een school in het Natte gebied.Op school wordt ze verplicht om met Max, een Natte, een werkstuk te maken. Wat met wederzijdse achterdocht begint, groeit al snel uit tot een fascinatie voor elkaars wereld en een ontluikende vriendschap. Maar de situatie is complex. Max’ vader is omgekomen bij de laatste overstroming, en er worden vraagtekens gezet bij de rol die de Gouverneur daarbij speelde. Max’ broer Li is nauw betrokken bij een gewelddadige verzetsgroep.In afwisselende hoofdstukken lezen we door de ogen van Max en Nina hoe de situatie escaleert en uitmondt in een onontkoombare apotheose.",,,Paperback,,398 pages,"

","A few million years ago, our ancestors came down from the trees and began to stand upright, freeing our hands to create tools and our minds to grapple with the world around us.   Leonard Mlodinow takes us on a passionate and inspiring tour through the exciting history of human progress and the key events in the development of science. In the process, he presents a fascinating new look at the unique characteristics of our species and our society that helped propel us from stone tools to written language and through the birth of chemistry, biology, and modern physics to today’s technological world.   Along the way he explores the cultural conditions that influenced scientific thought through the ages and the colorful personalities of some of the great philosophers, scientists, and thinkers: Galileo, who preferred painting and poetry to medicine and dropped out of university; Isaac Newton, who stuck needlelike bodkins into his eyes to better understand changes in light and color; and Antoine Lavoisier, who drank nothing but milk for two weeks to examine its effects on his body. Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and many lesser-known but equally brilliant minds also populate these pages, each of their stories showing how much of human achievement can be attributed to the stubborn pursuit of simple questions (why? how?), bravely asked.  The Upright Thinkers is a book for science lovers and for anyone interested in creative thinking and in our ongoing quest to understand our world. At once deeply informed, accessible, and infused with the author’s trademark wit, this insightful work is a stunning tribute to humanity’s intellectual curiosity.  (With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)",0307908232,9780307908230),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","Reflecting on forty years of matrimony, John Piper exalts the biblical meaning of marriage over its emotion, exhorting couples to keep their covenant for all the best reasons.Even in the days when people commonly stayed married ""'til death do us part,"" there has never been a generation whose view of marriage was high enough, says Pastor John Piper. That is all the more true in our casual times.Though personal selfishness and cultural bondage obstruct the wonder of God's purpose, it is found in God's Word, where his design can awaken a glorious vision capable of freeing every person from small, Christ-ignoring, romance-intoxicated views. As Piper explains in reflecting on forty years of matrimony: ""Most foundationally, marriage is the doing of God. And ultimately, marriage is the display of God. It displays the covenant-keeping love between Christ and his people to the world in a way that no other event or institution does. Marriage, therefore, is not mainly about being in love. It's mainly about telling the truth with our lives. And staying married is not about staying in love. It is about keeping covenant and putting the glory of Christ's covenant-keeping love on display.""This Momentary Marriage unpacks the biblical vision, its unexpected contours, and its weighty implications for married, single, divorced, and remarried alike.",1433507129,9781433507120),Hardcover,,191 pages,"

","Lauren Layne’s Sex, Love & Stiletto series simmers to a boil as two high-powered magazine writers find love amid a war of words.   As a leading columnist for Stiletto, Grace Brighton has built a career warning women about rotten, cheating liars. She just never suspected her fiancé would be one of them. After Grace takes a heart-mending hiatus, her first assignment is to go on a couple of dates with a counterpart from the men’s magazine Oxford and report her impressions. Grace 1.0 may have been instantly smitten with the gorgeous correspondent, but Grace 2.0 has sworn off relationships for six months, and she’s not falling for his outstanding bod and trophy-winning kisses . . . or is she?   Jake Malone wants to get back to the fly-by-night, who-knows-what’s-next guy he used to be, and he knows exactly how to do it. Oxford is adding a travel section, and Jake—with no wife and no kids and a willingness to live anywhere, eat anything, do everything—is perfect for the job . . . except that his playboy reputation makes his new editor nervous. To get the gig, he must agree to a fluffy joint article with Stiletto. But after just one date with snooty, sumptuous, sensational Grace Brighton, Jake starts taking this assignment a whole lot more seriously.",0345547268,9780345547262),ebook,,228 pages,"

","Nicole Garrett, a self-proclaimed nerd, has had her future planned out for years. Taking chances has never appealed to her on any level, but growing up means adapting to change and accepting that life moves on no matter what. With her best friends, Piper and Stephanie both starting families of their own, Nicole finds herself concentrating harder on her plan to become a doctor, leaving little time for anything else other than working at the local pub to help cover her living expenses. There is nothing worth more to her than making something of herself—unless you count Corey Tate.  Corey Tate isn’t a self-proclaimed anything. He doesn’t care enough. But ask anyone who has ever been around him and they’ll tell you he’s a bad-boy-recluse, who has a somewhat short fuse. He works hard and plays harder. Even though he has no clue what is involved in having an authentic relationship with a woman, Nicole Garrett has him curious enough to consider trying. Having zero experience in relationships proves to be a challenge for him, both mentally and emotionally.  Timing is everything, right? How much time has to pass before the moment is lost? Two years of knowing glances, private talks, and a connection that surprises them both, come to a head when Corey draws a line in the sand. Can these two very different people find their way to a love that can last forever, or will their own flaws ruin what could have been? If Corey and Nicole could get out of their own heads, they might just find out the difference between falling in love and being in love.",,,,,,,"['Romance', 'Contemporary Romance', 'Academic', 'College', 'Romance']"

","When tragedy shatters Anna’s life at a young age, she finds hope in two men who take her under their wings. Life is perfect until her sixteenth birthday when her world is turned upside down. Her beloved Jack and Devin have turned into monsters that haunt only the darkest of nightmares; nightmares that soon become her reality. The Life of Anna follows the naive and innocent Anna as she enters a dark world of greed, politics, and an evil puppet master who pulls the strings to her world. And beyond. Readers be warned, for this journey is not for the faint of heart. You are about to venture into a world of dark plots, sinister villains, and deeply erotic taboo encounters. Are you brave enough to enter the Life of Anna?   ***WARNING*** This book is for grownups. This book is not for people who are easily offended, get nightmares easily, or have difficulty reading books about tough subjects. I do not glorify bad things, but bad things do happen to my poor characters. This is not your typical love story. My heroine does not fall in love and live happily ever after... at least not like the typical heroine. There is a happily ever after, but it is a long, painful journey to that end. This book will likely offend you. This book might make you cry; it might make you throw up. It is a dark book. As my friend, Heidi, said, “It’s dark. It gets darker. It gets even darker, and then it gets even more darker. And then, just when you think it can’t get any darker, it does.” But, don’t worry. I take you to the deep end gradually. ;) There are many sexual situations in this series of books. People die. People get hurt. Things aren’t always truly the way they appear. The antagonist isn’t just a bad guy; he’s EVIL. My heroine’s worldview is skewed; things that may appall you are perfectly normal to her. Any violence in this book is non-gratuitous and crucial to the plot and character development. Do not read this if you are under the age of consent in your country. Do not get angry if the subject or actual book upsets you. If you're reading this, you've been warned.",,,Kindle Edition,,2024 pages,"

Hereditary ability to use the Strains divides the city into two classes: the wealthy Highmost, who can access the full potential of the Strains, and the Common tradesmen, who are limited to mundane spells, known as beggar magic.With the help of the Strains, Common teen Leilani rescues and befriends a gifted Highmost girl, Zebedy. The girls’ friendship opens Leilani’s eyes to the world of the Highmost. She’s intrigued by Zeb’s close relationship with the Strains, and longs to know them as she does. Zeb, in turn, comes to depend on Leilani’s strength and intelligence, making them an inseparable team, ready to take on anything with the Strains at their back. As their unlikely friendship strengthens and endures, Zeb draws Leilani further into the Highmosts’ intrigues. Beneath the polished, academic facade of the Highmost manors lurks a threat to the Strains. An unknown force consumes their music, leaving only heart-rending silence behind. Leilani and Zeb will do anything to save their beloved Strains, but as the silence grows, they face danger their previously sheltered lives could never prepare them for. Whoever is behind the death of the Strains is willing to kill to keep their secret safe. To preserve the Strains, the girls may have to sacrifice their friendship, or even their lives.",,,Kindle Edition,,197 pages,"

","Winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature. A city is hit by an epidemic of 'white blindness.' The blindness spreads, sparing no one. Authorities confine the blind to a vacant mental hospital secured by armed guards. Inside, the criminal element among the blind hold the rest captive: food rations are stolen, women are raped. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides seven strangers through the barren streets. The developments within this oddly anonymous group -- the first blind man, the old man with the black eye patch, the girl with dark glasses, the boy with no mother, and the dog of tears -- are as uncanny as the surrounding chaos is harrowing. A parable of loss and disorientation, of man's worst appetities and hopeless weaknesses, ""Blindness"" is one of the most challenging, thought-provoking, and ultimately exhilarating novels published in any language in recent years.",0151002517,9780151002511),Hardcover,,293 pages,"

She is the queen of Spencer High—and it’s time to make it official.Alexandra has a goal, you see—Homecoming Queen. Her ambitions are far grander than her small town will allow, but homecoming is just the first step to achieving total domination.

","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Jeff Shaara returns to the Civil War terrain he knows so well, with the latest novel in the series that started with A Blaze of Glory and A Chain of Thunder. In The Smoke at Dawn, the last great push of the Army of the Cumberland sets the stage for a decisive confrontation at Chattanooga that could determine the outcome of the war.   Summer, 1863. The Federal triumph at Vicksburg has secured complete control of the Mississippi River from the Confederacy, cementing the reputation of Ulysses S. Grant. Farther east, the Federal army under the command of William Rosecrans captures the crucial rail hub at Chattanooga. But Rosecrans is careless, and while pursuing the Confederates, the Federal forces are routed in north Georgia at Chickamauga Creek. Retreating in a panic back to Chattanooga, Rosecrans is pursued by the Confederate forces under General Braxton Bragg. Penned up, with their supply lines severed, the Federal army seems doomed to the same kind of defeat that plagued the Confederates at Vicksburg. But a disgusted Abraham Lincoln has seen enough of General Rosecrans. Ulysses Grant is elevated to command of the entire theater of the war, and immediately replaces Rosecrans with General George Thomas. Grant gathers an enormous force, including armies commanded by Joseph Hooker and Grant’s friend, William T. Sherman. Grant’s mission is clear: Break the Confederate siege and destroy Bragg’s army.  Meanwhile, Bragg wages war as much with his own subordinates as he does with the Federals, creating dissension and disharmony in the Southern ranks, erasing the Confederate army’s superiority at exactly the wrong time.   Blending evocative historical detail with searing depictions of battle, Jeff Shaara immerses readers in the world of commanders and common soldiers, civilians and statesmen. From the Union side come the voices of Generals Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and George Thomas—the vaunted “Rock of Chickamauga”—as well as the young private Fritz “Dutchie” Bauer. From the Rebel ranks come Generals Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, and James Longstreet, as well as the legendary cavalry commander, Nathan Bedford Forrest. A tale of history played out on a human scale in the grand Shaara tradition, The Smoke at Dawn vividly recreates the climactic months of the war in the West, when the fate of a divided nation truly hangs in the balance.",0345527410,9780345527417),Hardcover,,495 pages,"

Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did.This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple.

","The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.",0140012486,9780140012484),Mass Market Paperback,,220 pages,"

","Jedné větrné noci roku 1600 při pokusu obeplout svět ztroskotá holandská loď Erasmus u východojaponského pobřeží. Její velitel, jeden z předních evropských lodivodů, Angličan John Blackthorne, se tak stane „zajatcem japonských ostrovů“, nesmíří se však s rolí nečinného pozorovatele a popisovatele téměř neznámé země, jejích obyvatel, historie, zvyků. Blackthornovy schopnosti a znalosti brzy podstatně zasáhnou do dosud nerozhodnutého boje o vládu nad Japonskem, který mezi sebou svádějí nejvlivnější samurajové a do něhož se svým nezanedbatelným vlivem zapojují i jezuité. Je to boj krutý, nesmlouvavý a neúprosný, plný nástrah a intrik – v sázce totiž není nic menšího než titul šóguna, před kterým se skloní celé Japonsko. Stejně jako exotický Evropan nenávratně mění Zemi vycházejícího slunce, přerod prodělává také Blackthornovo myšlení a cítění. Postupně začíná chápat a respektovat japonský smysl pro důstojnost a zdvořilost, objevuje novou krásu, harmonii a zcela se proměňují jeho představy o sexu, náboženství a smrti. Clavellův román o střetu dvou kultur, který se odehrává v neklidném období japonských i evropských dějin, je knihou nejen dramatickou a strhující, ale i poučnou, a právem si získal celosvětovou popularitu.",,,Hardcover,,983 pages,"

Nie jest ona, w świetle autorskich enuncjacji, skomponowaną przemyślnie historią o czymś, co uprzednio zaistniało w świadomości pisarza, ale opisem procesu poznania, który autor inicjuje, projektując sytuację wyjściową, a czytelnik podąża tylko o krok za nim i na równi jest wprzęgnięty w rozwiązywanie zagadki."" - Prof. Jerzy Jarzębski""Na obie głośne adaptacje Solaris – film Andrzeja Tarkowskiego z 1971 roku i Stevena Soderbergha z 2002 – można spojrzeć jak na swego rodzaju dyskusję z autorem.

","Few people outside of ECKANKAR have ever heard of the ECK-Vidya, the ancient science of prophecy, which is the modus operandi for delving into the past, present and future, used by the adepts of Ancient Order of Vairagi-this is the order of ECK Masters. It gives man much to think about, that he has a way to receive and give certain knowledge about one's self which is useful and valuable. Life is largely a struggle in which man employs the known in an effort to conquer the unknown. Everywhere people are endeavoring to predict the future for meeting it in a more prepared manner. The whole story of the ECK-Vidya is the penetration into the realms of the generally unknown areas, not yet explored by the psychics, scientists, mystics or saints. The ECK-Vidya involves the principle of the cycles of life. It is up to the individula to learn these subtle changes and to make the adjustment as they arise. The minor changes always affect the greater changes. So when one is able to recognize and handle the very smaller cycles within himself, then he is able to bring about control over his life in the inner which controls his whole universe, that which he carries with himself at all times. ECKANKAR, of itself, is the highest path to God. But in its own broad and comprehensive aspects are included thirty or more facets or spiritual works, such as prophecy, healing, self-realization, the deja-vu powers, siddhi (spiritual knowledge), omnipresence, making events happen for one's own future, to name a few. All these are carried on upon a higher spiritual level than those of the occult, metaphysical and religious teachings. The vibrations of anyone practicing the ECK-Vidya are so high that those on the lower psychic scale can never be compared with them.",1570430306,9781570430305),Paperback,,214 pages,"

","The first-person account of a 26-year-old who fought in the war in Sierra Leone as a 12-year-old boy. This is the story of how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. In more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide, it is estimated there are some 300,000 child soldiers. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them. What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. Ishmael Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve in Sierra Leone, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he'd been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found he was capable of truly terrible acts. This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty. Ishmael Beah came to the United States when he was seventeen, and graduated from Oberlin College in 2003. He lives in New York City. About The Author: Ishmael Beah came to the United States when he was seventeen and graduated from Oberlin College in 2004. He is a member of the Human Rights Watch Children's Rights Division Advisory Committee and has spoken before the United Nations on several occasions.

Afflicted with Klein-Levin Syndrome, she suffers episodes of prolonged sleep that steal weeks, and sometimes even months, from her life. But unlike most KLS patients, she doesn’t spend each episode in a catatonic state or wake up with no recollection of the time she’s missed. Instead, Bryn spends half her life in an alternate reality made up of her memories. For Bryn, the past is a place, until one day a boy she’s never met before washes up on the illusory beach of her dreams with no memory of who he is.  But the appearance of this strange boy isn’t the only thing that’s changed. Bryn’s symptoms are worsening, her body weakening as she’s plagued by hallucinations even while awake. Her only hope of finding a cure is to undergo experimental treatment created by a German specialist. But when Dr. Banz reveals that he knows more about her strange symptoms than he originally let on, Bryn learns that the boy in her head might actually be the key to understanding what’s happening to her, and worse, that if she doesn’t find out his identity before it’s too late, they both may not survive.",,,Kindle Edition,,289 pages,"

","I sei protagonisti di ""Cloud Atlas - L'atlante delle nuvole"" vivono in punti e momenti diversi del mondo e del tempo, eppure fanno parte tutti di un unico schema, una specie di matrioska composta da sei personaggi uniti l'uno all'altro dal filo sottile e inestricabile del caso. Le loro anime si spostano come nuvole, passando dal corpo di un notaio americano di metà Ottocento, giunto su un'isola del Pacifico per assistere ai devastanti effetti del colonialismo, al giovane musicista che s'intrufola nell'esistenza di un celebre compositore belga tra le due guerre mondiali. Da un'intrepida giornalista che indaga sull'omicidio di uno scienziato antinucleare in piena guerra fredda, a un editore inglese in fuga dai creditori nella Londra anni Ottanta, sino a un clone schiavizzato nella Corea del prossimo futuro. Per arrivare infine all'alba del nuovo mondo - all'indomani dell'Apocalisse - e al suo primitivo, stupefatto abitante.",886836137X,9788868361372),Paperback,Pickwick,597 pages,"

","China has more than 114 million migrant workers, which represents the largest migration in human history. But while these workers, who leave their rural towns to find jobs in China's cities, are the driving force behind China's growing economy, little is known about their day-to-day lives or the sociological significance of this massive movement. In Factory Girls, Leslie T. Chang tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women whom she follows over the course of three years. Chang vividly portrays a world where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a cell phone; where lying about your age, your education, and your work experience is often a requisite for getting ahead; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Throughout this affecting portrait of migrant life, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family's migrations, within China and to the West, providing a historical frame of reference for her investigation. At a time when the Olympics will have shifted the world's focus to China, Factory Girls offers a previously untold story about the immense population of unknown women who work countless hours, often in hazardous conditions, to provide us with the material goods we take for granted. A book of global significance, it demonstrates how the movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and the fates of families, transforming our world much as immigration to America's shores remade our own society a century ago.",0385520174,9780385520171),Hardcover,,420 pages,"

","Understand what a world had to do to survive. When the Locust Horde burst from the ground fifteen years ago to slaughter the human population of Sera, mankind began a desperate war against extinction. Now after a decade and a half of bloody fighting, and with billions dead, the survivors—the Gears of the Coalition of Ordered Governments, along with a small band of civilians—have been forced to destroy their own cities and sacrifice their entire civilization to halt the Locust advance. The last-ditch measures have succeeded, but at an enormous cost: the survivors have been reduced to a handful of refugees. Escaping to a haven on the remote island of Vectes, they begin the heartbreaking task of rebuilding their devastated world. For a while, there’s hope . . . making peace with old enemies, and once again planning for the future. But the short respite is shattered when Vectes comes under siege from an even deadlier force than the Locust—the Lambent, a hideous and constantly mutating life-form that destroys everything in its path. As the Lambent’s relentless assault spreads from the mainland to the island, the refugees finally understand what drove the Locust from their underground warrens and sparked the global war. While Marcus Fenix and the Gears struggle to hold back the invasion, the Coalition faces a stark choice—fight this new enemy to the last human, or flee to the wastelands to take their chances and live like the human pariahs known as the Stranded . . . even as Coalition chairman Richard Prescott still guards one last, terrible secret about the Locust, the Lambent, and the future of mankind. . . .",1439183953,9781439183953),Hardcover,,443 pages,"

","Kde schází lidskost, jdou výčitky stranou.Bývalý příslušník jednotek SEAL John Kelly doufá, že bude mít už jen klid na to, aby se přenesl přes traumata, která si vedle vyznamenání za statečnost přinesl z vietnamské války, a aby se vzpamatoval z tragické smrti své ženy. Ale osud pro něj píše jiný scénář.Žena, která začínala získávat v jeho životě trvalejší roli než jen jako náhodná partnerka pro flirt, padne za oběť nemilosrdné pomstě drogového podsvětí, z něhož se snažila s Kellyho pomocí vymanit.V téže chvíli vrcholí přípravy Pentagonu k tajné misi, která má zachránit dvacítku válečných pilotů z rukou severovietnamského režimu a Sovětů, kteří je drží v nelidských podmínkách ve snaze dostat z nich vojenská tajemství. Když špičky Pentagonu rozhodují, kdo by měl záchranné operaci velet, shodnou se na osvědčeném Johnu Kellym.Přestože jeho život ovládla touha po nemilosrdné pomstě drogovým bossům, které si předsevzal fyzicky zlikvidovat za smrt milované ženy, John Kelly souhlasí. Vymění pro ten okamžik přítmí nočních baltimorských ulic, ve kterých operuje jako osamělý vražedný mstitel, za velitelskou uniformu a za tým zkušených bojovníků. Z Johna Kellyho se ještě jednou stává specialista CIA John Clark, který si svou činností pro vládu vybudoval ve Washingtonu značnou úctu.Vytvořil si však i nepřátele, jak zjišťuje v průběhu mise, jíž někdo zjevně nepřeje úspěch. A podobně jako akce osamělého lovce aktérů podsvětí doma jej podezření dovádí až do notně vysokých mocenských kruhů. Slabší povahy by to vzdaly. Nikoli však John Clark, který je rozhodnut počínat si nemilosrdně a bez výčitek.Není to poprvé, co Tom Clancy odstrčil do pozadí svého ústředního hrdinu Jacka Ryana a do centra dění postavil jeho temné alter ego Johna Clarka. Učinil ho hlavním hrdinou románů Kardinál z Kremlu, Nejhorší obavy i Jasné nebezpečí. Za nový prvek této jeho knihy však lze považovat částečný odklon od záležitostí celonárodní či dokonce celosvětové důležitosti a ponor do psychiky muže, který bere do vlastních rukou spravedlnost, jež se ho bezprostředně, osobně týká a které by se jiným způsobem než nemilosrdnou sólovou akcí nedomohl.",8073410974,8073410974,Hardcover,,552 pages,"

","Teen and adult fans of Matthew Quick, David Levithan, and Rainbow Rowell will adore this quirky story of coming-of-age, coming out, friendship, love...and agoraphobia. Sixteen-year-old Solomon is agoraphobic. He hasn’t left the house in three years, which is fine by him. Ambitious Lisa desperately wants to get into the second-best psychology program for college (she’s being realistic). But how can she prove she deserves a spot there? Solomon is the answer. Determined to “fix” Sol, Lisa thrusts herself into his life, introducing him to her charming boyfriend Clark and confiding her fears in him. Soon, all three teens are far closer than they thought they’d be, and when their facades fall down, their friendships threaten to collapse, as well.   A hilarious and heartwarming coming-of-age perfect for readers of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and All The Bright Places, Highly Illogical Behavior showcases the different ways in which we hide ourselves from the world—and the ways in which love, tragedy, and the need for connection may be the only things to bring us back into the light.",,,Kindle Edition,,256 pages,"

Tom acepta el encargo 'de paso pone tierra por medio a posibles problemas policiales' y encuentra a Dickie y a su amiga Marga, con quienes establece una relación que progresivamente irá enturbiándose hasta que desemboca en el crimen y el engaño.",8433920049,9788433920041),Paperback,Compactos Anagrama,344 pages,"

","In 1899 Jeremy, a young engineer, leaves a small town in Maine to oversee the construction of a railroad across British East Africa. In charge of hundreds of Indian laborers, he becomes the reluctant hunter of two lions that are killing his men in nightly attacks on their camp. Plagued by fear, wracked with malaria, and alienated by a secret he can tell no one, he takes increasing solace in the company of an African man who scouts for him.In 2000 Max, an American ethnobotonist, travels to Rwanda in search of an obscure vine that could become a lifesaving pharmaceutical. Stationed in the mountains, she shadows a family of gorillas—the last of their group to survive the merciless assault of local poachers. Max bears a striking gift for communicating with the apes. But soon the precarious freedom of both is threatened as a violent rebel group from the nearby Congo draws close.Told in alternating perspectives that interweave the two characters and their fates, Audrey Schulman’s newest novel deftly confronts the struggle between progress and preservation, idiosyncrasy and acceptance. Evoking both Barbara Kingsolver and Andrea Barrett, this enthralling fiction, wise and generous, explores some of the crucial social and cultural challenges that, over the years, have come to shape our world.The engaging story and memorable characters make this fine novel an ideal book club selection.",1609450647,9781609450649),Paperback,,353 pages,"

","As a veteran war correspondent, Chris Hedges has survived ambushes in Central America, imprisonment in Sudan, and a beating by Saudi military police. He has seen children murdered for sport in Gaza and petty thugs elevated into war heroes in the Balkans. Hedges, who is also a former divinity student, has seen war at its worst and knows too well that to those who pass through it, war can be exhilarating and even addictive: “It gives us purpose, meaning, a reason for living.” Drawing on his own experience and on the literature of combat from Homer to Michael Herr, Hedges shows how war seduces not just those on the front lines but entire societies, corrupting politics, destroying culture, and perverting the most basic human desires. Mixing hard-nosed realism with profound moral and philosophical insight, War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning is a work of terrible power and redemptive clarity whose truths have never been more necessary.",1400034639,9781400034635),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","A revelatory and redemptive memoir from the lead guitarist of the legendary band Def Leppard—the first book ever written by one of its members—chronicling the band’s extraordinary rise to superstardom and how they’ve maintained it for three decades.Meet Phil Collen. You may know him as the lead guitarist in Def Leppard, whose signature song “Pour Some Sugar on Me” is still as widely enjoyed as when it debuted in 1988. Maybe you’ve heard of him as the rock star who gave up alcohol and meat more than twenty-five years ago. Most likely you’ve seen him shirtless—in photos or in real life—flaunting his impeccably toned body to appreciative female fans.But it wasn’t always like this. Collen worked his way up from nothing, teaching himself guitar from scratch as a teenager by imitating his heroes. He slogged it out in London-based pub bands for years, long before Def Leppard formed and transformed from unknowns to icons (all thanks to a little album called Pyromania), from playing openers in near-empty arenas to headlining in those same stadiums and selling them out every night. But as Collen discovered, true overnight success is a myth. Like the other band members, he had to struggle and fight his way to the top; in the end, he says, “our work ethic saved us.” Just as it still does.This is Collen’s story, starting with his first real taste of success and wild rock and roll excess as a member of the seminal glam rock outfit Girl. But once he joins Def Leppard, it’s also an amazing underdog tale featuring a bunch of ordinary working-class lads who rose to mega-stardom, overcoming incredible obstacles—such as drummer Rick Allen losing an arm in a car crash and the tragic death of guitarist Steve Clark, Phil’s musical soul mate, who lost his fight with alcoholism. Featuring personal, never-before-seen photos of Collen and his band mates on stage and off, Adrenalized is a fascinating account of the failures, triumphs, challenges, and rock-hard dedication it takes to make dreams come true.",147675165X,9781476751658),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","The ancient veneration of the sun is one of the greatest celebrations in history. It has been encoded in sacred texts and sites by peoples separated by vast distances for thousands of years across the world.Although often looked at as simple-minded sun-worshipers, there is another reason why the ancients aligned some of their most inexplicable and advanced sites to the sun and stars, and encoded the movements of the heavens in their sacred teachings.The sun, source of all light and life, is central to a cosmic spirituality that is both ancient and timeless—and as ever-present as always. Its principles have formed the basis of many of the world’s religions—unbeknownst even to many of those who follow them—and are just as relevant to people searching for spirituality today.The Path of the Spiritual Sun by Belsebuub uncovers the profound spiritual significance of the veneration of the sun, pulling together the sites, texts, traditions, and symbols from around the world that were based on the solar cycle to reveal the common thread of spirituality running like a current of eternal knowledge through all of them and imbued in the very fabric of creation itself.Contains a guide with ceremonies and mantras to celebrate the solstices and equinoxes based on ancient practices from around the worldIn The Path of the Spiritual Sun, Belsebuub has created a comprehensive and practical guide to the celebration of the sun. Over seventeen chapters, the book explains:* Why ancient peoples all over the world and separated by vast distances, venerated the sun* How some of the most iconic religious and spiritual symbols can be found in the movements of the cosmos* The spiritual meaning behind the autumn, spring, winter, and summer solstices and equinoxes* A collation of the different esoteric practices and traditions that were celebrated on the solstice and equinox from around the world* An exploration of the many ancient sites that align to the solstice and equinox, and the esoteric symbols they contain* In-depth explanations of the meaning behind spiritual symbols, myths, sites, and sacred teachings from around the world* Ceremonies and rituals to celebrate the solstice and equinox today, based on actual ancient celebrations, including mantras, sacred texts, and symbols* A practical guide to revitalizing the traditions from around the world that celebrate the sun with a rediscovered understanding of their profound meaningAbout the AuthorBelsebuub is the author of a number of books on spirituality, out-of-body experiences, dreams, self-discovery, and esoteric knowledge. He has appeared on radio and television programs internationally, and writes from decades of spiritual and mystical experience, while his wife contributes with the research into history, cosmology, ancient sites, and sacred texts.",,,ebook,,,"

","A deluxe edition of Whitman's crowning achievement, with an introductory essay by Harold Bloom I celebrate myself, and sing myself, And what I assume you shall assume, For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.When Walt Whitman self-published his Leaves of Grass in July 1855, he altered the course of literary history. One of the greatest masterpieces of American literature, it redefined the rules of poetry while describing the soul of the American character. Throughout his great career, Whitman continuously revised, expanded, and republished Leaves of Grass, but as Harold Bloom reminds us, the book that matters most is the 1855 original. In celebration of the poem’s 150th anniversary, Penguin Classics proudly presents the 1855 text in its original and complete form, with a specially commissioned introductory essay by Harold Bloom. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

","A literary event: one of the most celebrated novels ever written, in a magnificent new translation.Seven years ago, the incomparable Lydia Davis brought us an award- winning, rapturously reviewed new translation of Marcel Proust's Swann's Way that was hailed as ""clear and true to the music of the original"" (Los Angeles Times) and ""a work of creation in its own right"" (Claire Messud, Newsday). Now she turns her gifts to the book that defined the novel as an art form. When Emma Rouault marries dull, provincial doctor Charles Bovary, her dreams of an elegant and passionate life crumble. She escapes into sentimental novels but finds her fantasies dashed by the tedium of her days. Motherhood proves to be a burden; religion is only a brief distraction. She spends lavishly and embarks on a series of disappointing affairs. Soon heartbroken and crippled by debts, Emma takes drastic action with tragic consequences for her husband and daughter. When published in 1857, Madame Bovary was embraced by bourgeois women who claimed it spoke to the frustrations of their lives. Davis's landmark translation gives new life in English to Flaubert's masterwork.",0670022071,9780670022076),Hardcover,,342 pages,"

","Primul prieten.Prima iubire.Ultimele cuvinte.ÎNAINTE. Miles Halter – un adolescent singuratic pasionat de cuvintele rostite de personaje celebre în ultimele lor clipe de viaţă – pleacă la şcoala cu internat Culver Creek în căutarea a ceea ce Rabelais numea „Marele Necunoscut"".Acest Necunoscut se dovedeşte mai tulburător decât şi-ar fi imaginat vreodată când în noul său cerc de prieteni îşi face intrarea seducătoarea Alaska Young. Inteligentă, amuzantă, imprevizibilă, Alaska îl atrage într-o lume misterioasă de lumini şi umbre, ce stă sub semnul ultimelor cuvinte ale lui Simón Bolívar, faimosul general imortalizat de Gabriel García Márquez: „Cum o să mai ies eu din labirintul ăsta?""DUPĂ.

În întunericul de lângă mine, Alaska mirosea a sudoare şi a raze de soare şi a vanilie, iar în acea noapte luminată de o lună firavă vedeam doar silueta ei, excepţie făcând momentele în care fuma, când tutunul aprins al ţigării ei îi învăluia faţa într o lumină roşiatică. Dar, chiar şi pe întuneric, îi vedeam ochii — două smaralde arzătoare. Avea acel soi de privire pătrunzătoare care te făcea să i cedezi.""",9737079280,9789737079282),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","At twenty-seven, Anne Elliot is no longer young and has few romantic prospects. Eight years earlier, she had been persuaded by her friend Lady Russell to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, a handsome naval captain with neither fortune nor rank. What happens when they encounter each other again is movingly told in Jane Austen's last completed novel. Set in the fashionable societies of Lyme Regis and Bath, Persuasion is a brilliant satire of vanity and pretension, but, above all, it is a love story tinged with the heartache of missed opportunities.This edition is part of the Penguin Classics Clothbound series designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith.",0141197692,9780141197692),Hardcover,Clothbound,288 pages,"

","Goethe es el alemán de fama perpetua, grande entre los grandes de todos los tiempos. Universal por su genio, no se le resistió ningún género literario: fue poeta, novelista, pensador, autor dramático y hombre de ciencia de fecundas instituciones. El libro imperecedero de Goethe es Fausto, obra inconmensurable, a la vez drama, misterio, poema simbólico y filosófico. Más de seis décadas de la vida de Goethe laboraron en la composición de Fausto, tragedia que ha sido denominada ""la segunda Biblia de los alemanes"". Fausto es la obra capital de Goethe. La idea v la realización palpitaron en el pecho del poeta desde su inquieta infancia hasta los días apacibles y melancólicos de su vejez. Puede decirse que Fausto es Goethe. El genial alemán estuvo siempre obsesionado por la búsqueda de la Verdad y éste es asimismo el gran drama de Fausto.

","Für einen Kronprinzen führt Pyrgus Malvae ein ausgesprochen abenteuerliches Leben. Sein Vater ist der Purpurkaiser des Elfenreiches, doch im Augenblick zieht Pyrgus es vor, nicht im Schatten -- und der Sicherheit -- des Palastes zu wohnen, sondern unerkannt unter dem so genannten gemeinen Volk. Mitunter kommt es da auch zu gefährlichen Situationen, vor allem nachdem er einen wertvollen Phönix aus den Klauen des hinterhältigen Lord Hairstreak befreit hat. Der will sich verständlicherweise rächen und lässt Pyrgus von seinen Männern verfolgen. Nach wilder Hatz durch die Gassen der Stadt sieht sich der Kronprinz gezwungen, in einer stinkenden Leimfabrik Zuflucht zu suchen. Doch dort wartet die nächste Überraschung auf ihn: Nicht nur werden harmlose Kätzchen in brodelnde Leimbottiche geworfen, einer der Besitzer entpuppt sich gar als finsterer Zauberer, der Pyrgus einem mächtigen Dämonen opfern möchte. Herbie Brennan, einer der erfolgreichsten Schriftsteller Irlands, hat mit Das Elfenportal seinen ersten Fantasy-Roman vorgelegt. Neben der an Ideen überreichen Haupthandlung fasziniert das Buch auch durch die Geschichte des 14-jährigen Henry, der sich in unserer Welt -- der Gegenwelt des Elfenreiches -- mit schweren familiären Problemen herumschlagen muss und eines Tages unvermittelt einem Fabelwesen begegnet. Wird es ihm gelingen, Pyrgus zur Seite zu stehen, ohne dass seine Eltern etwas von seinen Eskapaden bemerken? Ähnlich wie Philip Pullmans Der goldene Kompass steht Das Elfenportal an der Schwelle zwischen Jugend- und Erwachsenenliteratur, und ganz ohne Zweifel lässt sich sagen, dass Leser jeden Alters begeistert sein werden. Herbie Brennan ist ein souveräner Erzähler, der seine Ausflüge in das Reich der Fantasie gekonnt in unserer Wirklichkeit verankert und dem Roman dadurch eine zusätzliche Dimension verleiht. Ein tolles Buch für alle, die sich ihre Neugier auf unbekannte Welten bewahrt haben! --Hannes Riffel",3423208937,9783423208932),Broschiert,,368 pages,"

","Six months after Ciran defeated King Lorcan and instigated a peace treaty between the High Court of Ireland and the Goblin realm, things have been slowly getting back to normal in the kingdoms. That is, until the council decides that it's time for High King Eamon to find a queen.  On top of that, there seem to be stirrings of rebellion in the Faelands, as not all the Fair Folk like the High Court's treaty with the Goblins. So it's up to Ciran Mac Cool and his company to stop the rebellion before it goes too far, while also trying to keep Eamon safe from potential assassins. And with all the prospective brides rubbing elbows with the High King, that's easier said than done.  With the help of their friends and a spunky agent from the Bureau of Protection Against Fair Folk, Ciran's Company attempts to stop the Faery plots before Ireland is thrown into all out war. Again.  An Earthly King is another action packed book in this Celtic urban fantasy series with lots of friendship, humor, angst, and even traces of the Ballad of Tam Lin.",,,Paperback,,425 pages,"

For nearly four decades, Eldritch Swan has been locked away in an Irish prison and now, at last, has been released. Shocked and suspicious, Stephen listens to the old man’s story and is caught up in a tale that begins at the dawn of World War II, when Eldritch worked for an Antwerp diamond dealer with a trove of Picassos—highly valuable paintings that later disappeared. Stephen, who finds his uncle by turns devious, charming, and brazen, then meets Rachel Banner, a beautiful American who may have inherited the Picassos—and is determined to see justice done for her family. But in this tale of revenge and redemption, justice is the ultimate illusion. Eldritch, Stephen, and the woman Stephen has fallen in love with soon find themselves fighting for their lives—against sinister forces still guarding a secret that must never be revealed.",0593060253,9780593060254),Hardcover,,391 pages,"

As such, she often gets herself embroiled in other people's lives - especially those of her glamorous new neighbours, the Napiers, whose marriage seems to be on the rocks. One cannot take sides in these matters, though it is tricky, especially as Mildred, teetering on the edge of spinsterhood, has a soft spot for dashing young Rockingham Napier.

","Ce roman retrace la vie de Charlotte Salomon, artiste peintre morte à vingt-six ans alors qu'elle était enceinte. Après une enfance à Berlin marquée par une tragédie familiale, Charlotte est exclue progressivement par les nazis de toutes les sphères de la société allemande. Elle vit une passion amoureuse fondatrice, avant de devoir tout quitter pour se réfugier en France.

","Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives. “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.",,,Paperback,,249 pages,"

","Sous la canicule qui frappe l'Angleterre en ce mois d'août 1935, la jeune Briony a trouvé sa vocation : elle sera romancière. Finsi les contes de fées et les mélodrames de l'enfance. Du haut de ses treize ans, elle voit dans le roman un moyen de déchiffrer le monde. Mais lorsqu'elle surprend sa grande sœur Cecilia avec Robbie, fils de domestique, sa réaction naïve aux désirs des adultes va provoquer une tragédie. Trois vies basculent et divergent, pour ne se recroiser que cinq ans plus tard, dans le chaos de la guerre, entre la déroute de Dunkerque et les prémices du Blitz. La brutalité du réel va faire mûrir Briony. Mais est-il encore temps d'expier un crime d'enfance ?Prolongeant une grande tradition anglaise, celle de Lawrence et du Messager, tout en s'interrogeant sur les pouvoirs et les limites du romancier, Ian McEwan restitue, avec une égale maîtrise, les frémissements d'une conscience et les rapports de classes, la splendeur indifférente de la nature et les tourments d'une Histoire aveugle aux individus.

Jack Brownfield, a borderer, in a life not of his choosing, continues to travel a dangerous path not of his design. He seeks to escape the bonds that hold him. But ties, bound tightly, are never easy to break. This is a story of contrast and redemption, as seven seek salvation for a lonely Cumbrian village on a Solway shore.‘There is a place, ethereal, where the elements of rock and sand slowly melt into the sea. A place to find in the morning, when the wind is stilled and tide receded. When God’s breath sits over the water and clouds the distant hills of Dumfriesshire in blues of unnatural hue.’",150561273X,9781505612738),Paperback,,348 pages,"

","In a dazzling display of invention and storytelling, the incomparable Lois McMaster Bujold offers us the razor-keen edge of a very different sword...On the eve of the Daughter's Day - the grand celebration that will honor the Lady of Spring, one of the five reigning deities - a man broken in body and spirit makes his way slowly down the road to Valenda. A former courtier and soldier, Cazaril has survived indignity and horrific torture as a slave aboard an enemy galley. Now he seeks nothing more than a menial job in the kitchens of the Dowager Provincara, in the noble household where he served as page in his youth.But the gods have greater plans for this humbled man. Welcomed warmly, clothed and fed, he is named, to his great surprise, secretary tutor to the Royesse Iselle - the beautiful, strong-willed sister of the impetuous boy who is destined to be the next ruler of the land. But the assignment must ultimately carry Cazaril to the one place he fears even more than the sea: to the royal court of Cardegoss, rife with intrigues and lethal treacheries.In Cardegoss, the powerful enemies who once placed Cazaril in chains and bound him to a Roknori oar now occupy the most lofty positions in the realm, beneath only the Roya himself. Yet something far more sinister than their scheming hangs like a sword over the royal family: a curse of the blood that taints not only those who would rule, but those who stand in their circle. The life and future of both Iselle and her entire blighted House of Chalion lie in dire peril. The only recourse left to her loyal, damaged servant is the employment of the darkest and most forbidden of magics - a choice that will indelibly mark Cazaril as a tool of the miraculous... and trap him, flesh and soul, in a maze of demonic paradox, damnation, and death for as long as he dares walk the five-fold pathway of the gods.Only Robert A. Heinlein has won more Hugo Awards for Best Novel than Lois McMaster Bujold, a singularly lauded author whose work has been compared to Jane Austen's. Now channeling her remarkable storytelling genius in an exciting new direction, she creates a riveting tale rich in atmosphere, magic, character, and consequence that twists and turns in unanticipated ways. Much more than simply the next eagerly awaited tour de force by Lois McMaster Bujold, The Curse of Chalion is a stunning masterwork of fantastic invention that demonstrates the vast range of her astonishing talents - and elevates her into the pantheon of premier contemporary fantasists.",0380979012,9780380979011),Hardcover,,442 pages,"

If that which makes you beautiful becomes society’s undoing, would you steal a fake child to save the future?


The Virginia Corp. is reeling from major losses, and after the brutal double murder in Prague, Monarch Enterprises isn’t sure if Savannah is even alive. With her kill contract still open and assets now hunting her on Astor’s campus, Monarch prepares the hyper-skilled young assassin, Delta 1A, to execute her on sight. Savannah is gone, though. Disappeared.

In her stead, the love-struck Abby Swann remains obsessed not only with Jake and Damien, but with morality issues surrounding Gerhard’s miracle transformations. When she attacks the staff at Gerhard’s San Francisco lab and kidnaps a clone, a gorgeous teenage red head, Abby unleashes a firestorm of events that should have her dead several times over. Her survival seems impossible, though, and this has her wondering, has she become another one of Gerhard’s twisted experiments?

Complicating matters, the worst of tragedies strikes her inner circle. How will the new and improved Abby Swann cope with her need to right yet another catastrophic wrong? With the enigmatic and ever evolving Brayden James helping her mete out her own brand of justice, of course! The problem is, Abby is an itty-bitty fish in shark-infested waters spanning back through the ages, and she’s about to cross two men, both psychotic monsters of their own sort, both men the likes of which she has never encountered. Her chances of survival? Damn near zero.


Due to mature content, Clone is recommended for ages 15 and up.



INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR



Q – How do I get 

Vannie, 

The Swann series prequel, when it’s not listed on Amazon?
A – Inside Clone or at the author’s website, you’ll find a link to download the FREE prequel. Vannie is an engaging read, a 47 page novella that can be enjoyed no matter where you’re at in the series, although you’ll probably enjoy the series even more if you start with Vannie.


Q – What makes the Swann series special?
A – I remember devouring the Harry Potter books thinking there was always something thrilling about each new adventure. The kinds of literary highs these stories inspire produce a feeling like no other! We’ve seen vampires, werewolves, angels, demons and tales from the dystopian future; I desperately wanted to tap into the next evolution of the young adult fiction genre! From this mindset, the Swann series was born…


Q – What order should I read the books in?
A – The books are meant to be read in the following order:

 
   Vannie 
   Swann 
   Monarch 
   Clone 
   Masochist 
   Weapon 
   Raven 
   Abomination

","""Simply compelling.""--Mordecai Richler. ""A cautionary tale of scholarly merit.""--William S. Burroughs. ""Chilling...will keep you up nights turning pages.""--Peter Gorner, The Chicago Tribune. In 1845, Sir John Franklin set off, determined to ""penetrate the icy fastness"" of the Arctic. But he and his 129 men never made it. For the next 35 years, more than 20 major rescue parties searched fruitlessly for the vanished expedition. In this updated version of a bestseller that sold over 118,000 copies, a top forensic anthropologist and a historian tell the dramatic tale of excavating three sailors from the Franklin party. The bodies, well preserved by the permafrost, gave up their secrets to 20th century science, and the researchers pieced together a story of horrific starvation, scurvy, and cannibalism...Absolutely unforgettable--with photos in both color and black and white. The authors both live in Alberta, Canada. 192 pages, 43 color illus., 5 x 7 3/4. ",0747577277,9780747577270),Paperback,,278 pages,"

","Set against the backdrop of the Jim Crow South and the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA’s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America’s space program—and whose contributions have been unheralded, until now.Before John Glenn orbited the Earth or Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as “Human Computers,” calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts by Jim Crow laws, these “colored computers,” as they were known, used slide rules, adding machines, and pencil and paper to support America’s fledgling aeronautics industry, and helped write the equations that would launch rockets, and astronauts, into space.Drawing on the oral histories of scores of these “computers,” personal recollections, interviews with NASA executives and engineers, archival documents, correspondence, and reporting from the era, Hidden Figures recalls America’s greatest adventure and NASA’s groundbreaking successes through the experiences of five spunky, courageous, intelligent, determined, and patriotic women: Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, Christine Darden, and Gloria Champine.Moving from World War II through NASA’s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War, and the women’s rights movement, Hidden Figures interweaves a rich history of scientific achievement and technological innovation with the intimate stories of five women whose work forever changed the world—and whose lives show how out of one of America’s most painful histories came one of its proudest moments.",,,Kindle Edition,Movie tie-in Edition,373 pages,"

","In this madcap journey, a bestselling journalist investigates psychopaths and the industry of doctors, scientists, and everyone else who studies them. The Psychopath Test is a fascinating journey through the minds of madness. Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power. He spends time with a death-squad leader institutionalized for mortgage fraud in Coxsackie, New York; a legendary CEO whose psychopathy has been speculated about in the press; and a patient in an asylum for the criminally insane who insists he's sane and certainly not a psychopath. Ronson not only solves the mystery of the hoax but also discovers, disturbingly, that sometimes the personalities at the helm of the madness industry are, with their drives and obsessions, as mad in their own way as those they study. And that relatively ordinary people are, more and more, defined by their maddest edges.",1594488010,9781594488016),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Exhaustively researched and masterfully written, Foote’s epic account of the Civil War unfolds like a novel. “A stunning book full of color, life, character and a new atmosphere of the Civil War, and at the same time a narrative of unflagging power. Eloquent proof that an historian should be a writer above all else.” —Burke Davis “Anyone who wants to relive the Civil War . . . will go through this volume with pleasure. . . . Years from now, Foote’s monumental narrative most likely will continue to be read and remembered as a classic of its kind.” —New York Herald Tribune Book Review “To read this great narrative is to love the nation. . . . Whitman, who ultimately knew and loved the bravery and frailty of the soldiers, observed that the real Civil War would never be written and perhaps should not be.

","From the National Book Award-winning author of Just Kids: an unforgettable odyssey into the mind of this legendary artist, told through the prism of cafés and haunts she has visited and worked in around the world.M Train is a journey through eighteen ""stations."" It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village café where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation, alongside signature memories including her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself. M Train is a meditation on endings and on beginnings: a poetic tour de force by one of the most brilliant multiplatform artists at work today.",1101875100,9781101875100),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

Starting with what might be the most basic editing question - Why do cuts work? - Murch treats the reader to a wonderful ride through the aesthetics and practical concerns of cutting film. Along the way, he offers his unique insights on such subjects as continuity and discontinuity in editing, dreaming, and reality; criteria for a good cut; the blink of the eye as an emotional cue; digital editing; and much more. In this second edition, Murch reconsiders and completely revises his popular first edition's lengthy meditation on digital editing (which accounts for a third of the book's pages) in light of the technological changes that have taken place in the six years since its publication.",1879505622,9781879505629),Paperback,Revised Second Edition,148 pages,"

","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - Dispatches from the 2016 election that provide an eerily prescient take on our democracy's uncertain future, by the country's most perceptive and fearless political journalist.In twenty-five pieces from Rolling Stone--plus two original essays--Matt Taibbi tells the story of Western civilization's very own train wreck, from its tragicomic beginnings to its apocalyptic conclusion. Years before the clown car of candidates was fully loaded, Taibbi grasped the essential themes of the story: the power of spectacle over substance, or even truth; the absence of a shared reality; the nihilistic rebellion of the white working class; the death of the political establishment; and the emergence of a new, explicit form of white nationalism that would destroy what was left of the Kingian dream of a successful pluralistic society.Taibbi captures, with dead-on, real-time analysis, the failures of the right and the left, from the thwarted Bernie Sanders insurgency to the flawed and aimless Hillary Clinton campaign; the rise of the ""dangerously bright"" alt-right with its wall-loving identity politics and its rapturous view of the ""Racial Holy War"" to come; and the giant fail of a flailing, reactive political media that fed a ravenous news cycle not with reporting on political ideology, but with undigested propaganda served straight from the campaign bubble. At the center of it all stands Donald J. Trump, leading a historic revolt against his own party, ""bloviating and farting his way"" through the campaign, ""saying outrageous things, acting like Hitler one minute and Andrew Dice Clay the next."" For Taibbi, the stunning rise of Trump marks the apotheosis of the new postfactual movement.Taibbi frames the reporting with original essays that explore the seismic shift in how we perceive our national institutions, the democratic process, and the future of the country. Insane Clown President is not just a postmortem on the collapse and failure of American democracy. It offers the riveting, surreal, unique, and essential experience of seeing the future in hindsight.""Scathing . . . What keeps the pages turning in this so freshly familiar story line is the vivid observation and original turns of phrase.""--San Francisco Chronicle",0399592466,9780399592461),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","The last bushrangers in Australian history, James and Patrick Kenniff, were at the height at their horse thieving operation at turn of the 20th century. In One, troops cannot pull the Kenniff Gang out of the ranges and plains of Western Queensland – the brothers know the terrain too well, and the locals are sympathetic to their escapades. When a policeman and a station manager go out on patrol from tiny Upper Warrego Station and disappear, Sergeant Nixon makes it his mission to pursue the gang, especially, Jim Kenniff, who becomes for him an emblem of the violence that resides in the heart of the country.From the award-winning author of The Mary Smokes Boys, One is a novel of minimalist lyrical beauty that traverses the intersections between violence and love. It asks what right one man has to impose his will on another, and whether the written law can ever answer the law of the heart?",,,Paperback,,368 pages,"

","In het Mississippi van de jaren 60 wordt aan zwarte vrouwen wel de opvoeding van blanke kinderen toevertrouwd, maar niet het poetsen van het tafelzilver. Drie vrouwen zijn het allesbepalende racisme meer dan zat en besluiten dat de verschillen tussen hen minder belangrijk zijn dan de overeenkomsten.Het is 1962 en de 23-jarige Eugenia, door iedereen Skeeter genoemd, besluit een carrière als schrijfster na te jagen. Naar een onderwerp hoeft ze niet ver te zoeken, als op een dag haar vriendin Hilly vertelt over haar missie in alle huizen van blanke gezinnen een apart toilet te installeren voor de zwarte hulp. Hoe meer Hilly gebrand is op deze vorm van segregatie, hoe meer Skeeter twijfelt aan de 'gewone' manier van doen. Ze begint de verhalen te verzamelen van zwarte vrouwen die als hulp in de huishouding werken. De eerste die haar verhaal aan Skeeter durft te vertellen is Aibileen. Ze heeft als hulp al zeventien blanke kinderen opgevoed, maar als haar eigen zoon Treelore verongelukt op zijn werk, kijken de blanke bazen de andere kant uit. Aibileen haalt ook haar vriendin Minny over om Skeeter in vertrouwen te nemen.

","Rock a stadium. Bang a chick. Repeat. As lead singer of The Devil’s Share, Dash Conner could get anything or anyone he wanted—until he met Lexi Grant.  MONEY. FAME. WHISKEY. SEX.  For Dash Conner, lead singer of The Devil’s Share, everything he wanted was his for the asking. Whiskey. Drugs. Money. Sex. But not Lexi Grant. For the first time since he picked up a guitar, a girl was actually demanding he woo her. For a chance with her, Dash would do that and more.  Lexi Grant was no groupie. Just because the biggest rock star in the world smiled at her didn’t mean she had to fall into bed with him—but it was going to be awfully hard to resist that impish smile and those tatted abs. Surely one night of fun wouldn’t hurt anyone.  Unless that night ends with a broken condom.  For Lexi and Dash, that’s just the beginning. Add an overly affectionate pit bull, a missing guitarist, a house full of sorority girls, a junkie ex-bandmate and an extreme aversion to Jäger, and it’s either a recipe for disaster or true love.",,,Kindle Edition,2nd edition,134 pages,"

","#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NOW A STARZ ORIGINAL SERIESTwenty years ago, Diana Gabaldon swept readers into her mesmerizing world brimming with history, romance, and adventure. In celebration of the series that has captured the heart of millions, here is a special 20th anniversary edition of the novel that started it all—including a new essay, a new map, a CD with Outlander the musical, and more. OUTLANDERThe year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is just back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient circles that dot the British Isles. Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an “outlander”—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of Our Lord . . . 1743.   Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life, and shatter her heart. For here James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire—and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.  Praise for Diana Gabaldon’s Outlander novels   “Marvelous and fantastic adventures, romance, sex . . . perfect escape reading.”—San Francisco Chronicle, on Outlander  “History comes deliciously alive on the page.”—New York Daily News, on Outlander   “Gabaldon is a born storyteller. . . . The pages practically turn themselves.”—The Arizona Republic, on Dragonfly in Amber  “Triumphant . . . Her use of historical detail and a truly adult love story confirm Gabaldon as a superior writer.”—Publishers Weekly, on Voyager  “Unforgettable characters . . . richly embroidered with historical detail.”—The Cincinnati Post, on Drums of Autumn  “A grand adventure written on a canvas that probes the heart, weighs the soul and measures the human spirit across [centuries].”—CNN, on The Fiery Cross   “The large scope of the novel allows Gabaldon to do what she does best, paint in exquisite detail the lives of her characters.”—Booklist, on A Breath of Snow and Ashes  “Features all the passion and swashbuckling that fans of this historical fantasy series have come to expect.”—People, on Written in My Own Heart’s Blood",0440423201,9780440423201),Hardcover,20th Anniversary Collector's Edition,688 pages,"

","A violent crime brings together four lives in Danielle Steel's sixtieth bestselling novel, the story of a mother's courage, a family's terror, and a triumph of human strength and dignity in the face of overwhelming odds.Outside the gates of a California prison, Peter Morgan is released after four long years and vows to redeem himself in the eyes of the young daughters he left behind. Simultaneously, Carl Waters, a convicted murderer, is set on the path of freedom with him. That night, three hundred miles south in San Francisco, police detective Ted Lee comes home to a silent house; for twenty-nine years, he has been living for his job--and slowly falling out of love with his wife. Across town, in an exclusive Pacific Heights neighborhood, a mother tries to shield her three children from the panic rising within her. Four months after her husband's death, Fernanda Barnes faces a mountain of debt she cannot repay, a world destroyed, and a marriage lost.Within weeks, the lives of these four people will collide in ways none of them could have foreseen. For Fernanda, whose life had once been graced by beautiful homes, security, success, and stunning wealth, the death of her brilliant, brooding husband was already too much to bear. She simply couldn't imagine a greater loss, until a devastating crime rocks her family to its core--and brings Detective Ted Lee into her life.A man of unshakable integrity, Lee will soon become the one person who tries to save Fernanda's family from a terrifying fate. Fernanda must draw on a strength she never knew she had. Racing against time in the underbelly of the criminal world, buffeted by the dark side of power, and unmoored by loss and betrayal, no one can predict where this tragedy will take them.Danielle Steel brilliantly explores the collision of a shocking crime with the ordinary lives of its victims in a novel that mesmerizes from start to finish. Ransom is at once a riveting evocation of life's inexplicable turns of fate and a testament to the human will to survive.",0552149934,9780552149938),Paperback,,429 pages,"

","Christmas Eve finds renowned, but now disgraced, defense lawyer George Able paying a final visit to his two children, Brian and Sandy. It is a final visit of a different sort to his estranged wife and her lover: George has a .38 in his coat pocket. Later that night, he finds himself on a deserted highway in deep dark country with missing bullets and missing time. It looks like a Christmas Miracle, especially when he meets a beautiful redhead who offers him a second chance. But the seemingly naive Red Morgan proves to be a troubling mix of love, lethality and, possibly, lunacy.  When George’s daughter is kidnapped by a man who might be associated with Morgan, the Able family and the criminal justice system are faced with a threat they are not equipped to handle. As a rescue attempt snowballs into a crime spree from the top of Illinois to its tip, a family must put aside its problems even as moral compromises undermine their good intentions. And while Red Morgan is too useful to send away, her dream of a white Vegas wedding with George faces one obstacle...  
Judging Angels
 is the first volume in The Rubricatae Chronicles. It draws on police procedural, urban fantasy, and heroic quest to provide the reader with an original Catholic psychological thriller that blends genres and provides more twists and tension than a murder trial. Timothy Capps, a recognized death penalty defense expert, tells this exciting, yet thoughtful, tale with the relish of a seasoned lawyer’s closing argument. And just as trials must probe the motives of defendants, the reader will discover that the real story is on the inside: ordinary people tempted to do the worst things for the best reasons.",0997792892,9780997792898),Paperback,,502 pages,"

","Life's greatest gifts come to us by accident. Barbara Delinsky has always had a gift for creating tales of extraordinary emotional power and depth. Now the New York Times bestselling author of Three Wishes surpasses herself once again in a novel that takes readers on a journey as richly textured, colorful, and poignant as the northern California landscape in which the book is set. Rachel Keats and Jack McGill were artists, deeply in love when they married, until the rush of life took its toll. After ten years of marriage, they divorced and went their separate ways. Jack stayed in San Francisco. Rachel moved with their two young daughters to Big Sur. Six years later, an alarming middle-of-the-night phone call demands that Jack put aside his own busy life and career as a leading architect to rush to his ex-wife's hospital bed. While she lies comatose, Jack maintains a bedside vigil and finds himself getting to know Rachel better than he ever did -- through their daughters, her friends, and, even more, through her art. Meanwhile, the beauty and grace of the Redwood canyon where she has made her home also work their own special alchemy upon Jack. He begins to see Rachel, his daughters, and the story of his marriage with new eyes. Coast Road celebrates those things in life that matter most -- the kinship of neighbors, the companionship of friends, and the irreplaceable time spent with children and family. Barbara Delinsky depicts with exquisite accuracy the ties that bind each of us to those people and places we hold most dear.",0743467175,9780743467179),Paperback,,480 pages,"

Caught between the manifold horrors of the past and the troubling dilemmas of the present, Elisha wrestles with guilt, ghosts, and ultimately God as he waits for the appointed hour and his act of assassination.

Violet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister’s recent death. When Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school, it’s unclear who saves whom.

","The second of a planned 10 volumes that will reprint all Sturgeon's short fiction covers his prolific output during 1940 and 1941, after which he suffered five years of writer's block. Showcasing Sturgeon's early penchant for fantasy, the first six selections include whimsical ghost stories, such as ""Cargo,"" in which a World War II munitions freighter is commandeered by invisible, peace-loving fairies. With the publication of his enduring SF classic, ""Microcosmic God,"" Sturgeon finally found his voice, combining literate, sharp-edged prose with fascinating speculative science while recounting the power struggle between a brilliant scientist, who creates his own miniature race of gadget makers, and his greedy banker.

","Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up. She graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant and has a total soft spot for Lily; and the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head, but Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his no dating rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan, her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. Combining a captivating romance with a cast of all too human characters, “It Ends with Us” is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.",1501110373,9781501110375),ebook,,384 pages,"

","Live by Night is a riveting epic layered with a diverse cast of loyal friends and callous enemies, tough rumrunners and sultry femmes fatales, Bible-quoting evangelists and cruel Klansmen, all battling for survival and their piece of the American dream.Boston, 1926. The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world. Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one - neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover - can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba. Live by Night is a riveting epic layered with a diverse cast of loyal friends and callous enemies, tough rumrunners and sultry femmes fatales, Bible-quoting evangelists and cruel Klansmen, all battling for survival and their piece of the American dream. At once a sweeping love story and a compelling saga of revenge, it is a spellbinding tour de force of betrayal and redemption, music and murder, that brings fully to life a bygone era when sin was cause for celebration and vice was a national virtue.",0062197754,9780062197757),Paperback,,416 pages,"

Al margen de lo que escribía para el periódico, Grossman dejó registradas sus experiencias en unos cuadernos, que se han mantenido inéditos hasta hoy, donde cuenta sincerament lo que vio en las calles de Stalingrado, en la batalla de Kursk, en la reconquista de Ucrania o en el avance del Ejército Rojo Alemania adentro, con los horrores de Treblinka o las escenas cotidianas de saqueos y violaciones. ""A veces, escribe, te trastorna tanto lo que has visto que se te acelera el corazón y sabes que la terrible imagen que acabas de ver pesrá sobre tu alma toda tu vida"". Antony Beevor ha transcrito estos cuadernos de Grossman, combinándolos con sus artículos, sus cartas y otros materiales para componer con todo ello un relato de dimensiones épicas que tal vez sea el más dramático y revelador testimonio de lo que fue realmente la mayor guerra de todos los tiempos.""",,,Paperback,,496 pages,"

"," Capital in the Twenty-First Century: by Thomas Piketty | Summary & Analysis A Smarter You In 15 Minutes… What is your time worth?Economics inequality, the uneven concentration of wealth, and prospects of economic growth will stay amongst the top of the world’s issues list of all time. Modernization of economic growth, as well as a more even spread of knowledge, have played a great role in minimizing inequalities at least to a lesser extent than what Karl Marx has predicted. However, the tendency of returns on capital to exceed economic growth rate still aids to the creation of significant inequality. Brilliantly added with empirical data and not just arguments, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” provides a comparative historical research on income inequality that is definitive, fresh, and enlightening.A major work on inequalities throughout economic history, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” uncovers major economic and social patterns, providing answers through a vast collection of data to supplement the already provided clear guiding theories. This book is extraordinarily ambitious and rigor, aiming to reorient the reader’s understanding of the history of economics. Further, the readers will be confronted by awakening economic lessons in today’s modern life. It is monumental and influential especially with regard to making an economic analysis.Written by a renowned French economist, Thomas Piketty, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is one of the most important books of the year, if not of the decade. It compares history and its relevance in the modern day society. Impossible to ignore, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is available online with free shipping options.

The implications of our views on it can affect everything from small choices we make every day to our perspective on criminal justice and capital punishment.

","La obra de Juan Rulfo (1917–1986) es sin duda la creación literaria mexicana que ha recibido mayor reconocimiento dentro y fuera de su país. La novela Pedro Páramo tuvo una larga gestación. Rulfo la menciona por primera vez en una carta de 1947, y puede trabajar en ella hasta terminarla entre 1953 y 1954, gracias a una beca del Centro Mexicano de Escritores. En 1954 publica adelantos de la misma en tres revistas y en 1955 aparece como libro. Entre los admiradores de esta obra maestra, habiendo escrito también sobre ella, figuran Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges y Susan Sontag. Pedro Páramo recoge lo más profundo de México y las formas y técnicas literarias más avanzadas de su siglo. Pocas obras tocan al lector mexicano como ésta, considerada también un clásico de la literatura universal. Sus traducciones se acercan al medio centenar y cada año aparecen nuevas versiones.

","Jorge Semprun was twenty years old - already an accomplished philosopher and poet - when arrested by Nazis for activites in the French Resistance. He was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp.

Per lunghi, interminabili giorni. Meno male che c'è Shirley Poppy a sollevare gli animi dei giovani del villaggio, con un nuovo, intricato mistero. Nascosto nel laboratorio di sua zia, infatti, la giovane e potentissima strega ha trovato un ricettario molto, molto strano. Non di uova e di farina si fa cenno nelle antiche pagine sgualcite, ma di spade di sale, di pezzi di cielo, di cuori di pietra e di un segreto, il Segreto del Bosco. Decisa a scoprire di cosa si tratta, Shirley coinvolge le gemelle Vaniglia e Pervinca e tutta la banda del Capitano in una serie di mirabolanti avventure.

","Two men, each handsome and unusually adept at his chosen work, embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized America’s rush toward the twentieth century. The architect was Daniel Hudson Burnham, the fair’s brilliant director of works and the builder of many of the country’s most important structures, including the Flatiron Building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C. The murderer was Henry H. Holmes, a young doctor who, in a malign parody of the White City, built his “World’s Fair Hotel” just west of the fairgrounds — a torture palace complete with dissection table, gas chamber, and 3,000-degree crematorium. Burnham overcame tremendous obstacles and tragedies as he organized the talents of Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles McKim, Louis Sullivan, and others to transform swampy Jackson Park into the White City, while Holmes used the attraction of the great fair and his own satanic charms to lure scores of young women to their deaths. What makes the story all the more chilling is that Holmes really lived, walking the grounds of that dream city by the lake'The Devil in the White City' draws the reader into a time of magic and majesty, made all the more appealing by a supporting cast of real-life characters, including Buffalo Bill, Theodore Dreiser, Susan B. Anthony, Thomas Edison, Archduke Francis Ferdinand, and others.In this book the smoke, romance, and mystery of the Gilded Age come alive as never before. Erik Larson’s gifts as a storyteller are magnificently displayed in this rich narrative of the master builder, the killer, and the great fair that obsessed them both.To find out more about this book, go to http://www.DevilInTheWhiteCity.com.",,,Kindle Edition,,447 pages,"

","In this Pulitzer Prize finalist and national bestseller, one of the world's leading cognitive scientists tackles the workings of the human mind. What makes us rational—and why are we so often irrational? How do we see in three dimensions? What makes us happy, afraid, angry, disgusted, or sexually aroused? Why do we fall in love? And how do we grapple with the imponderables of morality, religion, and consciousness? How the Mind Works synthesizes the most satisfying explanations of our mental life from cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and other fields to explain what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and contemplate the mysteries of life.This edition of Pinker's bold and buoyant classic is updated with a new foreword by the author.",0393069737,9780393069730),ebook,,672 pages,"

","Meditato dall'autore fin dal 1845, I miserabili vide la luce solo nel 1862: diciassette anni impiegò infatti Hugo per scrivere e pubblicare quello che egli stesso riteneva il suo capolavoro, il punto culminante della sua già monumentale opera. Accolto freddamente dalla critica - con la sola, notevolissima eccezione di Rimbaud che ne parlò come di ""un vero poema"" -, il romanzo ottenne invece una strepitosa fortuna di pubblico: 3500 copie vendute in poche ore, collette popolari per acquistarlo, un vero e proprio movimento d'opinione che fece preoccupare seriamente il regime di Napoleone III, per non parlare delle innumerevoli traduzioni e riedizioni, versioni cinematografiche e teatrali, fumetti... Un successo vasto e durevole, dovuto alla straordinaria capacità di Hugo di sintetizzare la sua vocazione poetico-simbolica e quella realistico-sociale, dando così vita a un'opera in cui le vicende dei tanti, indimenticabili personaggi si intrecciano con la storia del popolo di Parigi e la rievocazione dei momenti cruciali della sua epopea, dalla battaglia di Waterloo ai moti insurrezionali del 1832.",880443368X,9788804433682),Cofanetto, Oscar classici #114,1417 pages,"

","Odell Deefus, who's not the sharpest tool in the shed, has one goal: to ""try my hardest to be a good soldier against the mad dog Islamites."" But while driving to an army enlistment office in Callisto, Kansas, his '78 Chevy breaks down on the side of a country road, and it's only the beginning of his troubles. When he accepts a local's offer of shelter until the car is repaired, things go from bad to worse—worse as in murder, drug dealers, tenacious televangelists . . . and finding himself a prime target of the FBI, which thinks he's a member of a terrorist sleeper cell. And none of it bodes well for his unrequited crush on Condoleezza Rice. But fear, rash judgments, and extreme reactions are simply the norm in a post-9/11 world. Odell will just have to deal with it.",0061672947,9780061672941),Paperback,,437 pages,"

","Chi è lo sconosciuto gracile e male in arnese, avvolto in un cappottone nero, in cui Melik, immigrato turco di seconda generazione nato ad Amburgo, continua a imbattersi? Dopo l'11 settembre la vita del giovane, devoto musulmano e promessa della boxe, soffre di equilibri precari, e lui farebbe di tutto pur di non cacciarsi nei guai. Ma sua madre, che considera un dovere prestare aiuto a un compagno di fede, decide di dare ospitalità allo straniero. Lo strano ragazzo, che dice di chiamarsi Yssa Karpov, rivela di essere un profugo ceceno fuggito da un carcere russo e di essere entrato in Germania clandestinamente con l'intenzione di studiare medicina, grazie anche all'aiuto che gli verrà fornito da Tommy Brue. Peccato che Brue non abbia idea di chi lui sia. Il ceceno, però, è in possesso di una misteriosa parola d'ordine capace di ridestare improvvisamente il passato: ""lipizzano"". Quando Brue sente questo termine per bocca di Annabel Richter, avvocato specializzato nell'assistenza agli immigrati a cui Yssa si è rivolto, sa che non si riferisce alla nobile razza di cavalli di origine slovena. Lipizzano è la parola in codice con cui suo padre indicava ingenti e loschi capitali travasati dall'Unione Sovietica nelle casse della sua banca. John le Carré torna con una storia che si confronta con gli aspetti più ambigui della contemporaneità, ponendo l'accento sulle contraddizioni delle democrazie occidentali e sull'arroganza del potere nei confronti dei più deboli.",8804591714,9788804591719),Paperback,,345 pages,"

","You belong to me and all Paris belongs to me and I belong to this notebook and this pencil.Begun in the autumn of 1957 and published posthumously in 1964, Ernest Hemingway's A Moveable Feast captures what it meant to be young and poor and writing in Paris during the 1920s. A correspondent for the Toronto Star, Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist forms; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed Ulysses; Gertude Stein held court at 27 rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of rue génération perdue; and T. S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel, The Sun Also Rises, and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man -- a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafés and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.A Moveable Feast is at once an elegy to the remarkable group of expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.",,,Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","David Hume is the greatest and also one of the most provocative philosophers to have written in the English language. No philosopher is more important for his careful, critical, and deeply perceptive examination of the grounds for belief in divine powers and for his sceptical accounts of the causes and consequences of religious belief, expressed most powerfully in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and The Natural History of Religion. The Dialogues ask if belief in God can be inferred from the nature of the universe or whether it is even consistent with what we know about the universe. The Natural History of Religion investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from harmless polytheism to dogmatic monotheism. Together they constitute the most formidable attack upon the rationality of religious belief ever mounted by a philosopher. This edition also includes Section XI of The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and a letter concerning the Dialogues, as well as particularly helpful critical apparatus and abstracts of the main texts, enabling the reader to locate or relocate key topics.",0199538328,9780199538324),Paperback,Oxford World's Classics,218 pages,"

","Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, a New York Times Book Review Top Ten Book, National Book Award finalist, more than two and a half years on the New York Times bestseller listFrom the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the stunningly beautiful instant New York Times bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History, where her father works. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel.In a mining town in Germany, Werner Pfennig, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent to track down the resistance. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.Doerr’s “stunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors” (San Francisco Chronicle) are dazzling. Ten years in the writing, a National Book Award finalist, All the Light We Cannot See is a magnificent, deeply moving novel from a writer “whose sentences never fail to thrill” (Los Angeles Times).",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged,17 pages,"

As Mac, Barrons, Ryodan, and Jada struggle to restore control, enemies become allies, right and wrong cease to exist, and the lines between life and death, lust and love, disappear completely.Black holes loom menacingly over Dublin, threatening to destroy the Earth. Yet the greatest danger is the one MacKayla Lane has unleashed from within: the Sinsar Dubh—a sentient book of unthinkable evil—has possessed her body and will stop at nothing in its insatiable quest for power.The fate of Man and Fae rests on destroying the book and recovering the long-lost Song of Making, the sole magic that can repair the fragile fabric of the Earth. But to achieve these aims, sidhe-seers, the Nine, Seelie, and Unseelie must form unlikely alliances and make heart-wrenching choices. For Barrons and Jada, this means finding the Seelie Queen who alone can wield the mysterious song, negotiating with a lethal Unseelie prince hell-bent on ruling the Fae courts, and figuring out how to destroy the Sinsar Dubh while keeping Mac alive.This time, there’s no gain without sacrifice, no pursuit without risk, no victory without irrevocable loss.

","‟Una delle poche cose, anzi forse la sola ch'io sapessi di certo era questa: che mi chiamavo Mattia Pascal.” È l'incipit del romanzo più noto di Luigi Pirandello: Il fu Mattia Pascal (1904). In esso è contenuta la cellula generativa dell'intero libro. Quando lo scrisse, lo scrittore siciliano ne sapeva quanto chi, scorse queste prime righe, si predispone alla lettura. Scelti nome e cognome, cominciano le peripezie del personaggio, il quale presto si trova in una situazione simile a quella dell'autore: deve lui stesso dare vita a ‟un uomo inventato”. Durante questa vera e propria avventura dei nomi, il libro assume la sua forma pienamente novecentesca, nella quale autobiografia e biografia immaginaria si confondono. Consanguineo di quelli che saranno i sei personaggi in cerca d'autore, Mattia Pascal sembra a tratti lanciare messaggi al lettore perché lo liberi dal vincolo cartaceo e dunque dalla sua muta solitudine.‟La coscienza ironica e ascetica trova nella letteratura l'unico modo di operare che non entra in collisione con il mondo. La trasformazione della vita in letteratura, dopo la rottura ironica con quell'io che correva per il mondo in cerca della libertà e della felicità, conferma che soltanto la pacificazione con se stesso è il vero eden e l'unica utopia realizzabile.”(dal commento di Antonio Gagliardi)",8807820870,9788807820878),Paperback,Universale Economica.

","En el principio era el sonido, era el ritmo; la sustancia sonora es la materia prima del mundo: éste es el fundamento de El origen musical de los animales-símbolos del profesor Marius Schneider. Etnología, musicología y simbología se conjugan en esta obra que fue definida por Elémire Zolla como «la única completamente iniciática del siglo XX». Escrita en lengua castellana durante la estancia del profesor Schneider en Barcelona, fue publicada en 1946. Las culturas primitivas, con las que Schneider estuvo en contacto directo en África, y las denominadas altas culturas constituyen el ámbito que permite la reconstrucción de todo un sistema de correspondencias místicas entre los sonidos, los astros, los instrumentos musicales o los cuatro elementos. El autor parte de la cosmografía musical megalítica, conservada en la Europa medieval o en los textos védicos de la India, para descifrar las claves musicales inscritas en los capiteles de los claustros del monasterio de San Cugat y de la catedral de Gerona. Pero El origen musical de los animales-símbolos es, además, una auténtica iniciación en la simbología pues introduce al lector en las nociones básicas de correspondencia, analogía y ritmo común. Esta edición también incluye los gráficos y cosmogramas originales facsímiles que el propio Schneider realizó.",8478443681,9788478443680),Paperback,1st edition El Árbol del Paraíso [12],507 pages,"

","Introduction by Lorenzo Carcaterra A popular bestseller since its publication in 1844, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the great page-turning thrillers of all time. Set against the tumultuous years of the post-Napoleonic era, Alexandre Dumas’s grand historical romance recounts the swashbuckling adventures of Edmond Dantès, a dashing young sailor falsely accused of treason. The story of his long imprisonment, dramatic escape, and carefully wrought revenge offers up a vision of France that has become immortal. As Robert Louis Stevenson declared, “I do not believe there is another volume extant where you can breathe the same unmingled atmosphere of romance.” INCLUDES A MODERN LIBRARY READING GROUP GUIDE",037576030X,9780375760303),Paperback,,1462 pages,"

","Starting in the present and moving backward in time, this is the thrice-told tale of three women... 15-year-old part-black Rayona, searching for a way to find herself...her American Indian mother, Christine, consumed by both tenderness and resentment towards the people she loves...and the fierce and mysterious Ida, the mother and grandmother whose haunting secrets, ancient betrayals, and undying dreams echo silently though the years, bonding and braiding together the three strands of their shared past- and their future.",0446387878,9780446387873),Paperback,,372 pages,"

C’est convivial et pas trop agressif. On sent la fille douce et équilibrée. Mais quel jus ? Mieux vaut esquiver les grands classiques : évitons la pomme ou l’orange, trop vu. Il faut être un tout petit peu original, sans être toutefois excentrique. La papaye ou la goyave, ça fait peur. Le jus d’abricot, c’est parfait.

","Platero y yo es una narración de Juan Ramón Jiménez que recrea poéticamente la vida y muerte del burro Platero. Es muy celebre el primer parrafo: “Platero es pequeño, peludo, suave; tan blando por fuera, que se diría todo de algodón, que no lleva huesos. Sólo los espejos de azabache de sus ojos son duros cual dos escarabajos de cristal negro. Lo dejo suelto y se va al prado y acaricia tibiamente, rozándolas apenas, las florecillas rosas, celestes y gualdas... Lo llamo dulcemente: ¿Platero?, y viene a mi con un trotecillo alegre, que parece que se ríe, en no sé que cascabeleo ideal...”La primera edición se publico en 1914 (Ediciones De La Lectura) y en 1917 se publicó la edición completa, compuesta por 138 capítulos (Editorial Calleja, Madrid). Quedaba claro que era un texto adulto, aunque por su sencillez y transparencia se adecuara perfectamente a la imaginación y al gusto de los niños. Algunos capítulos encerraban una cierta critica social, revelando una dimensión del autor que muchos tardaron en advertir. El propio Juan Ramón Jiménez, en un prologuillo a la edición aclaraba: “Yo nunca he escrito ni escribiré nada para niños porque creo que el niño puede leer los libros que lee el hombre, con determinadas excepciones que a todos se le ocurren.”El poeta tenía la intencion de ampliar el texto hasta los 190 capítulos; de hecho, existen tres adicionales, escritos en la decada de 1920. Juan Ramón Jiménez planeó también una segunda parte, denominada Otra vida de Platero, de la que incluso esbozó algunos títulos. Un proyecto que, como el de publicar Platero y yo en cuadernos sueltos, no llegaría nunca a ver la luz.La presente edición de Platero y yo conmemora el 50 aniversario de la concesión del Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1956 al poeta andaluz Juan Ramón Jiménez.",8466752145,8466752145,Hardcover,1a.

","The story grew out of a map that led to imaginary treasure, devised during a holiday in Scotland by Stevenson and his nephew. The tale is told by an adventurous boy, Jim Hawkins, who gets hold of treasure map and sets off with an adult crew in search of the buried treasure. Among the crew, however, is the treacherous Long John Silver who is determined to keep the treasure for himself. Stevenson's first full-length work of fiction brought him immediate fame and continues to captivate readers of all ages. Climb aboard for the swashbuckling adventure of a lifetime. Treasure Island has enthralled (and caused slight seasickness) for decades. The names Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins are destined to remain pieces of folklore for as long as children want to read Robert Louis Stevenson's most famous book. With it's dastardly plot and motley crew of rogues and villains, it seems unlikely that children will ever say no to this timeless classic. --Naomi GesingerThis book was converted from its physical edition to the digital format by a community of volunteers.

","Andy Tyler has been the class daredevil since middle school. Over the years, he’s convinced his best friend, Jake Masterson, to perform some dangerous-looking stunts with him. But the dare they attempt on the night of their college graduation goes sideways. The firecrackers explode too soon and both of them end up with badly burned palms.But hey, nothing gets the “terrible two-o” down for long, and they recuperate in style at Andy’s family cottage in Cape Cod. As the weeks go by, both Andy and Jake grow frustrated over the inability to use their hands for all sorts of daily activities—including getting off. So Andy begins a new series of dares that don’t just cross the friendship line, they obliterate it.But what might be mere sexual relief to Andy is serious business to Jake, who only recently got over years of secret pining for his straight best friend. Inevitably, the burns heal, summer ends, and hearts are broken. To fix things, Andy will have to face the greatest dare of all.",,,ebook,1 edition,245 pages,"

","It’s a new day in the Empire. Tyrus has ascended to the throne with Nemesis by his side and now they can find a new way forward—one where they don’t have to hide or scheme or kill. One where creatures like Nemesis will be given worth and recognition, where science and information can be shared with everyone and not just the elite.But having power isn’t the same thing as keeping it, and change isn’t always welcome. The ruling class, the Grandiloquy, has held control over planets and systems for centuries—and they are plotting to stop this teenage Emperor and Nemesis, who is considered nothing more than a creature and certainly not worthy of being Empress.Nemesis will protect Tyrus at any cost. He is the love of her life, and they are partners in this new beginning. But she cannot protect him by being the killing machine she once was. She will have to prove the humanity that she’s found inside herself to the whole Empire—or she and Tyrus may lose more than just the throne. But if proving her humanity means that she and Tyrus must do inhuman things, is the fight worth the cost of winning it?",1534409920,9781534409927),Hardcover,,378 pages,"

","Two great spiritual masters share their own hard-won wisdom about living with joy even in the face of adversity.   The occasion was a big birthday. And it inspired two close friends to get together in Dharamsala for a talk about something very important to them. The friends were His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The subject was joy. Both winners of the Nobel Prize, both great spiritual masters and moral leaders of our time, they are also known for being among the most infectiously happy people on the planet.From the beginning the book was envisioned as a three-layer birthday cake: their own stories and teachings about joy, the most recent findings in the science of deep happiness, and the daily practices that anchor their own emotional and spiritual lives. Both the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu have been tested by great personal and national adversity, and here they share their personal stories of struggle and renewal. Now that they are both in their eighties, they especially want to spread the core message that to have joy yourself, you must bring joy to others.Most of all, during that landmark week in Dharamsala, they demonstrated by their own exuberance, compassion, and humor how joy can be transformed from a fleeting emotion into an enduring way of life.From the Hardcover edition.",,,Kindle Edition,,363 pages,"

","Mick “Scorcherˮ Kennedy is the star of the Dublin Murder Squad. He plays by the books and plays hard, and thatʼs how the biggest case of the year ends up in his hands. On one of the half-abandoned “luxuryˮ developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children have been murdered. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care. At first, Scorcher thinks itʼs going to be an easy solve, but too many small things canʼt be explained: the half-dozen baby monitors pointed at holes smashed in the Spainsʼ walls, the files erased from the familyʼs computer, the story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder slipping past the houseʼs locks. And this neighborhood—once called Broken Harbor—holds memories for Scorcher and his troubled sister, Dina: childhood memories that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control.",0670023655,9780670023653),Hardcover,,450 pages,"

","The wildly popular YouTube personality and author of the New York Times bestseller My Drunk Kitchen is back! This time, she’s stirring up memories and tales from her past.By combing through the journals that Hannah has kept for much of her life, this collection of narrative essays delivers a fuller picture of her life, her experiences, and the things she’s figured out about family, faith, love, sexuality, self-worth, friendship and fame.Revealing what makes Hannah tick, this sometimes cringe-worthy, poignant collection of stories is sure to deliver plenty of Hannah’s wit and wisdom, and hopefully encourage you to try your hand at her patented brand of reckless optimism.Personal note:Hello, my darlings! I am incredibly pleased to present BUFFERING: Unshared Tales of a Life Fully Loaded!As a big fan of memoirs, I wanted to try my hand at writing about the events of my life that deserve a little more consideration than can be accomplished in 140-characters or a 6-minute vlog. Now on the cusp of turning 30, I'm ready to expose some parts of my life that I haven't shared before. Before, it was all about privacy, process and time. And now the time has come! I’m ready to put myself out there, for you.  I'm a little nervous about all these vulnerable words going into the world, these tales about my love life, the wrestling I’ve done with faith, how I feel about sex and my family and myself. I’ve had a lot of trials, a lot of errors, but also a lot of passion. Here’s the thing--I've always found comfort in the stories shared by others, so I hope my stories, now that I feel ready to tell them, will bring you some comfort too.And when you read this book please remember: Buffering is just the time it takes to process.Enjoy!Love,Hannah   ",0062457535,9780062457530),ebook,,272 pages,"

","The dream chooses the dreamer, not the other way around—and Lazlo Strange, war orphan and junior librarian, has always feared that his dream chose poorly. Since he was five years old he’s been obsessed with the mythic lost city of Weep, but it would take someone bolder than he to cross half the world in search of it. Then a stunning opportunity presents itself, in the person of a hero called the Godslayer and a band of legendary warriors, and he has to seize his chance or lose his dream forever.What happened in Weep two hundred years ago to cut it off from the rest of the world? What exactly did the Godslayer slay that went by the name of god? And what is the mysterious problem he now seeks help in solving?The answers await in Weep, but so do more mysteries—including the blue-skinned goddess who appears in Lazlo’s dreams. How did he dream her before he knew she existed? And if all the gods are dead, why does she seem so real?Welcome to Weep.",,,Kindle Edition,,528 pages,"

","When I found an eviction notice taped on my apartment door, I had two options: find a comfortable cardboard box to call home, or move in with Tucker Jameson.  Seeing that cardboard makes me feel itchy, I chose the latter. Which shouldn't be that big of a deal since Tucker is one of my good friends. And because he's still pining after his ex-girlfriend and I'm trying to finish my nursing degree, there is nothing to worry about in the romance department, making my last semester an easy one to conquer.  Boy, was I wrong.  Rules are set, dinners are made, conversations are had, and a shirtless, swoony roommate walks around in nothing but a pair of black briefs, ruining me for every other man.  Before I know it, I turn into a panting, lust-filled woman begging for Tucker to kiss me, touch me, and show me exactly what is hiding under those briefs.  But with great orgasms, comes great consequences.  Tucker might be my friend and roommate but he’s also my best friend's ex-boyfriend, making him completely off-limits. At least that's what my brain is telling me, my heart is speaking an entirely different language.",,,Kindle Edition,1st edition,405 pages,"

","In an age of confusion, fear, and loss, Hanif Abdurraqib's is a voice that matters. Whether he's attending a Bruce Springsteen concert the day after visiting Michael Brown's grave, or discussing public displays of affection at a Carly Rae Jepsen show, he writes with a poignancy and magnetism that resonates profoundly.In the wake of the nightclub attacks in Paris, he recalls how he sought refuge as a teenager in music, at shows, and wonders whether the next generation of young Muslims will not be afforded that opportunity now. While discussing the everyday threat to the lives of black Americans, Abdurraqib recounts the first time he was ordered to the ground by police officers: for attempting to enter his own car.In essays that have been published by the New York Times, MTV, and Pitchfork, among others—along with original, previously unreleased essays—Abdurraqib uses music and culture as a lens through which to view our world, so that we might better understand ourselves, and in so doing proves himself a bellwether for our times.",,,Paperback,,291 pages,"

Η βροχή έχει κοπάσει πια, και πέφτει στην κίτρινη κουκούλα σαν ψιλόβροχο σε τσίγκινη στέγη. Το αγόρι με το κίτρινο αδιάβροχο είναι ο Τζορτζ Ντένμπροου, κι εκείνη τη φθινοπωρινή ημέρα ήταν έξι χρονών…Αυτό που κάνει τη μικρή πόλη του Ντέρι τόσο τρομακτικά διαφορετική από τις άλλες είναι όλα εκείνα που βλέπουν –και αισθάνονται– μόνο τα παιδιά. Στα φρεάτια και τους υπονόμους, το ""Αυτό"" καραδοκεί και παίρνει τη μορφή εφιάλτη, του βαθύτερου τρόμου που φωλιάζει σε κάθε παιδί. Όμως, πότε πότε, το Αυτό προβάλλει από τα ζοφερά και υγρά βάθη, αρπάζει, διαμελίζει, σκοτώνει… Τα χρόνια περνούν, τα παιδιά μεγαλώνουν, εγκαταλείπουν την πόλη, λησμονούν. Μέχρι τη στιγμή που κάποιος τους καλεί να επιστρέψουν, για να αντιμετωπίσουν για μία ακόμα φορά το Αυτό, που σαλεύει σαν ερπετό στα σκοτεινά έγκατα της μνήμης τους καθώς αναδύεται για να μετατρέψει τους εφιάλτες του παρελθόντος σε μια ανείπωτα φρικτή πραγματικότητα.",,,Paperback,,1008 pages,"

","تلك كانت أولى سنواتي الدراسية الجدية، ذلك أن الـ""ليسه فرانسه"" في نيويورك مختلفة كل الاختلاف عن المدرسة الفرنسية في بكين. مؤسسة متكلفة الرقي، رجعية المبادئ، تزدري المؤسسات التعليمية الأخرى. فيها مدرسون متعجرفون يفهموننا كيف ينبغي لنا أن نتصرف بوصفنا نخبة. كنت لا أبالي بترهات كتلك الترهات. وكانت حجرة الصف مكتظة بأولاد يثيرون في نفسي الفضول فلا أكف عن مراقبتهم بكثير من الدهشة. غالبيتهم من الفرنسيين وإن كان في عدادهم بعض الأميركيين لأن ارتياد الـ""ليسه فرانسه""، في نظر أهل نيويورك، يمثل ذروة الترقي الاجتماعي. لم يكن بين التلاميذ أي بلجيكي آخر. ظاهرة خبرتها بشيء من الفضول في أنحاء أخرى من العالم: إذ لطالما كنت التلميذة البلجيكية الوحيدة بين أترابي، الأمر الذي جعلني عرضة لفنون متنوعة من السخرية كنت أنا أول المستمتعين بطرافتها. كان ذلك في الفترة التي لم يشهد فيها دماغي أية أعطال. غذ لا تستغرقه عمليات ضرب الكميات الصماء أكثر من ثانية واحدة مع تعداد كسورها بنبرة تنم عن السأم لشدة يقيني من صحتها. أما دروس قواعد اللغة فكانت لي كشرب الماء، فالجهل صفة تجهلها نفسي، لأن الأطلس بطاقة هويتي واللغات اصطفتني برج بابلها. كان من شأن ذلك أن يعمي بصيرتي بالغرور لولا وفائي لعدم اكتراثي بالتميز. وكان المدرسون يهللون لنباهتي سائلين المرة تلو المرة: هل أنت واثقة ن كونك بلجيكية الجنسية؟ فأجيب المرة تلو المرة مبددة عذاب الريبة في روعهم بلى، وأمي أيضاً بلجيكية، وأجدادي وأجداد أجدادي. كان في هذا ما يزيد من حيرة مدرسي اللغة الفرنسية. فيما الصبية الصغار يرمقونني بنظرات الريبة كأنهم يقولون في سرهم: ""لا بد أن في الأمر خدعة"".والفتيات الصغيرات يرمقنني بنظرات معسولة. ذلك أن الأعراف النخبوية السائدة في المدرسة تغلب على مشاعرهم فضيلة الإقرار بالأمر الواقع، فيعلن، جهاراً، ومن دون لبس: ""أنت الأفضل، فهل تقبلين أن تكوني صديقتي؟"" لقد بلغت آميلي نوثومب مرتبة أكثر الكتاب مبيعاً بسرعة، وصارت روايات تنتظر بشغف من القراء الذين تعرفوا إلى أعمالها. تسرج نوثومب بلغة شيقة سلسة، وتقول أشياء كثيرة بلغة قليلة. في هذه الرواية، تأخذنا الكاتبة في رحلة تبدأ من اليابان ثم تعبر الصين وأميركا وبنغلادش والهند وكومبوديا، فيما هي تسرد حياة تبدو أنها حياتها منذ أن كانت طفلة حتى صارت ""الكاتبة"". وفي كل هذه المحطات نجد صوراً لا ندركها عبر الكتب، فهي الصور بعين آميلي نوثومب، وهي جاذبية السرد والروي بحرارة التحديات التي تصنع حياة المرء.",9953681503,9789953681504),Paperback,,239 pages,"

","With this outrageous new novel, China Miéville has written one of the strangest, funniest, and flat-out scariest books you will read this—or any other—year. The London that comes to life in Kraken is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about—or prevent—the End of All Things.In the Darwin Centre at London’s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre’s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux—better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy’s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens—human and otherwise—are adept in magic and murder.There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity—and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC—the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit—a branch of London’s finest that fights sorcery 

with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city’s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London’s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying—yet darkly charismatic—demonic duo.All of them—and others—are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be. From the Hardcover edition.",0345497503,9780345497505),Paperback,,509 pages,"

","An idealistic young student and a banished warrior become allies in a battle to save their realm in this first book of a mesmerizing epic fantasy series, filled with political intrigue, violent magic, malevolent spirits, and thrilling adventureEverything has a spirit: the willow tree with leaves that kiss the pond, the stream that feeds the river, the wind that exhales fresh snow . . .But the spirits that reside within this land want to rid it of all humans. One woman stands between these malevolent spirits and the end of humankind: the queen. She alone has the magical power to prevent the spirits from destroying every man, woman, and child. But queens are still just human, and no matter how strong or good, the threat of danger always looms. With the position so precarious, young women are chosen to train as heirs. Daleina, a seemingly quiet academy student, is under no illusions as to her claim to the throne, but simply wants to right the wrongs that have befallen the land. Ven, a disgraced champion, has spent his exile secretly fighting against the growing number of spirit attacks. Joining forces, these daring partners embark on a treacherous quest to find the source of the spirits’ restlessness—a journey that will test their courage and trust, and force them to stand against both enemies and friends to save their land . . . before it’s bathed in blood.",,,Kindle Edition,,368 pages,"

","To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough...not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.",1509803157,9781509803156),Paperback,Media tie-in,401 pages,"

Robert Sullivan turns the lowly rat into the star of this most perversely intriguing, remarkable, and unexpectedly elegant New York Times bestseller.Love them or loathe them, rats are here to stay-they are city dwellers as much as (or more than) we are, surviving on the effluvia of our society. In Rats, the critically acclaimed bestseller, Robert Sullivan spends a year investigating a rat-infested alley just a few blocks away from Wall Street. Sullivan gets to know not just the beast but its friends and foes: the exterminators, the sanitation workers, the agitators and activists who have played their part in the centuries-old war between human city dweller and wild city rat.Sullivan looks deep into the largely unrecorded history of the city and its masses-its herds-of-rats-like mob.

","Marc Woodworth's book covers the album's long and unorthodox period of writing, recording, sequencing, and editing. It includes interviews with members of the band, manager Pete Jamison, web-master and Guided by Voices historian Rich Turiel and Robert Griffin of Scat Records. At least sixty-five songs were recorded and considered for the album and five distinct concepts were rejected before the band hit upon the records final form. One late version, very nearly released, contained only a few of ""Bee Thousand's"" definitive songs. The rest were left out and nearly ended up in the boxes of cassette out-takes cluttering up Robert Pollard's basement. The story of Guided By Voices' transformation from an occasional and revolving group of complete unknowns to indie-rock heroes is very much part of the story behind the making of ""Bee Thousand."" In addition to providing a central account of how the record was made, Woodworth devotes a substantial chapter to the album's lyrics. Robert Pollard's lyrics are described by critics, when they're described at all, as a brand of tossed-off surrealism, as if his verbal sensibility is somehow incidental to the songs themselves. Nothing could be further from the truth. Woodworth offers a sustained discussion of Pollard's work as a writer of often sublime, beautiful, and very human lyrics.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

These culminated in What is Art?, published in 1898. Although Tolstoy perceived the question of art to be a religious one, he considered & rejected the idea that art reveals & reinvents through beauty. The works of Dante, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Baudelaire & even his own novels are condemned in the course of Tolstoy's impassioned & iconoclastic redefinition of art as a force for good, for the improvement of humankind.",,,Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Евгений Водолазкин - прозаик, филолог. Автор. В России его называют ""русским Умберто Эко"", в Америке - после выхода ""Лавра"" на английском - ""русским Маркесом"". Ему же достаточно быть самим собой. Произведения Водолазкина переведены на многие иностранные языки. Новый роман лауреата премии ""Большая книга"", бестселлера ""Лавр"" и изящного historical fiction ""Соловьев и Ларионов"" Евгения Водолазкина ""Авиатор"" - яркое событие в литературе. Книга оценивается критиками как один самых ожидаемых русских романов 2016 года (по версии Forbes, Meduza и др.). Герой романа ""Авиатор"" - человек в состоянии tabula rasa: очнувшись однажды на больничной койке, он понимает, что не знает про себя ровным счётом ничего - ни своего имени, ни кто он такой, ни где находится. В надежде восстановить историю своей жизни, он начинает записывать посетившие его воспоминания, отрывочные и хаотичные: Петербург начала ХХ века, дачное детство в Сиверской и Алуште, гимназия и первая любовь, революция 1917-го, влюбленность в авиацию, Соловки… Но откуда он так точно помнит детали быта, фразы, запахи, звуки того времени, если на календаре - 1999 год?..На передней стороне переплета рисунок Михаила Шемякина, созданный специально для этого издания.",,,Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","Roman Paula Coelha, ki je s svojo preprostostjo in modrostjo očaral in navdihnil množico zvestih oboževalcev po vsem svetu, je zgodba o mladem andaluzijskem pastirju Jakobu, ki iz rodne Španije odpotuje v egiptovsko puščavo, da bi našel zaklad, zakopan v piramidah. Pot mu prekrižajo ciganka, samooklicani kralj in alkimist, od katerih vsak skuša Jakoba usmeriti k pravemu cilju njegove poti. Prvotno popotovanje v iskanju materialnih dobrin se tako spremeni v odkrivanje zaklada, ki ga nosimo v sebi. Jakobova vsebinsko bogata, ganljiva pot, ki v sebi skriva pomemben moralni nauk, je pričevanje o neizčrpni moči sanj, ki nam lahko spremenijo življenje, in o tem, kako pomembno je prisluhniti svojemu srcu.Nikoli ne boš doumel, da Ljubezen nikdar ne odvrne človeka od Osebne legende. Ker če ga odvrne, potem to ni resnična ljubezen, ki govori govorico sveta.﻿﻿",9619010566,9789619010563),Paperback,,170 pages,"

","This edition reintroduces Sappho to the modern reader, providing a vivid, contemporary translation, which captures the spareness and the intensity of Sappho's line. The wondrous Mary Barnard translation was based, unfortunately, on the 1928 Loeb edition by J.M. Edmonds, who filled in many of Sappho's fragment with his own Greek lines. In Professor Barnstone's brilliant translation, Sappho's work is presented as we have inherited it, in its darkly antiromantic idiom that rejects sentimentality and ""prettiness.""Willis Barnstone is one of the most noted translators of today. Barnstone has translated numerous texts, including The Cosmic Fragments of Heraclitus, Greek Lyric Poetry, and a literary translation of the New Testament. He is also the author of New and Selected Poems (1997), Moonbook & Sunbook (1998) and other books of poetry.",189229513X,9781892295132),Paperback,26,144 pages,"

","At first glance, Bill Bryson seems an odd choice to write this addition to the Eminent Lives series. The author of 'The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid' isn't, after all, a Shakespeare scholar, a playwright, or even a biographer. Reading 'Shakespeare The World As Stage', however, one gets the sense that this eclectic Iowan is exactly the type of person the Bard himself would have selected for the task. The man who gave us 'The Mother Tongue' and 'A Walk in the Woods' approaches Shakespeare with the same freedom of spirit and curiosity that made those books such reader favorites.

","No one’s afterlife is as dispiriting as Audrey’s―at least that’s what she believes after waking up dead without her memories and being promptly assigned to hunt demons for the rest of eternity. She’s convinced God’s made a cosmic mistake; after all, she’d rather discuss the color of her nails than break them on angelic weapons.It doesn’t help that her trainer, Logan, is as infuriating as he is attractive. And just when Audrey and Logan appear close to developing an amicable relationship, a decision made under duress pushes their hearts in a direction neither of them saw coming.Despite her sub-par fighting abilities, an ancient weapon of unparalleled power chooses Audrey as its wielder, attracting the cautious gazes of her fellow hunters and the attention of Satan himself. With Satan’s eyes now fixed on Audrey, a battle for the safety of the living looms in the shadows.",,,Kindle Edition,2nd Edition ,351 pages,"

Intrigue, dissent and rebellion are on all sides.The Elves and other non-humans are still suffering under decades of repression, and growing numbers join the commando units hidden deep in the forest, striking at will and then dissolving into the trees. The Magicians are fighting amongst themselves, some in the pay of the kings, some sympathetic to the elves.And against this backdrop of fear and contempt Geralt and his lover Yennefer must protect Ciri, orphaned heir and sought by all sides.

In present-day Karachi, her daughter Aasmaani has just discovered a letter in the couple's private code—a letter that could only have been written recently. Aasmaani is thirty, single, drifting from job to job. Always left behind whenever Samina followed the Poet into exile, she had assumed that her mother's disappearance was simply another abandonment. Then, while working at Pakistan's first independent TV station, Aasmaani runs into an old friend of Samina's who gives her the first letter, then many more. Where could the letters have come from? And will they lead her to her mother? Merging the personal with the political, Broken Verses is at once a sharp, thrilling journey through modern-day Pakistan, a carefully coded mystery, and an intimate mother-daughter story that asks how we forgive a mother who leaves.  ",0156030535,9780156030533),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","On March 14, 2012, more than three million people read Greg Smith's bombshell Op-Ed in the New York Times titled ""Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs."" The column immediately went viral, became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, and drew passionate responses from former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch, and New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg. Mostly, though, it hit a nerve among the general public who question the role of Wall Street in society -- and the callous ""take-the-money-and-run"" mentality that brought the world economy to its knees a few short years ago. Smith now picks up where his Op-Ed left off.His story begins in the summer of 2000, when an idealistic 21-year-old arrives as an intern at Goldman Sachs and learns about the firm's Business Principle #1: Our clients' interests always come first. This remains Smith's mantra as he rises from intern to analyst to sales trader, with clients controlling assets of more than a trillion dollars.From the shenanigans of his summer internship during the technology bubble to Las Vegas hot tubs and the excesses of the real estate boom; from the career lifeline he received from an NFL Hall of Famer during the bear market to the day Warren Buffett came to save Goldman Sachs from extinction-Smith will take the reader on his personal journey through the firm, and bring us inside the world's most powerful bank.Smith describes in page-turning detail how the most storied investment bank on Wall Street went from taking iconic companies like Ford, Sears, and Microsoft public to becoming a ""vampire squid"" that referred to its clients as ""muppets"" and paid the government a record half-billion dollars to settle SEC charges. He shows the evolution of Wall Street into an industry riddled with conflicts of interest and a profit-at-all-costs mentality: a perfectly rigged game at the expense of the economy and the society at large.After conversations with nine Goldman Sachs partners over a twelve-month period proved fruitless, Smith came to believe that the only way the system would ever change was for an insider to finally speak out publicly. He walked away from his career and took matters into his own hands. This is his story.",1455598860,9781455598861),Paperback,,380 pages,"

","Women are the strength and foundation of any relationship or marriage; however, quite often they are taken for granted or unappreciated. Most men agree that their women are special; still, they fail to do what is required of them to keep them happy or satisfied. Every relationship and marriage has more obstacles that make them unsuccessful, and mainly because people stop doing, what they did to win the heart of their mates. Nowadays, women work, take care of the children, and contribute with finances of their families, and all they ask for is a thank you or something that says, ""I appreciate you ."" Moreover, after conversing with over a hundred women on family, love, relationship and marriage, I enclosed here in this book the twelve important things they ask of their men. Today, it is easy for women to leave their men, and find success on their own or with another man. Therefore, it is important for men to understand the signs that are driving their women away, and do the simple things that are conducive to keeping their women happy. I understand that implementing these twelve things will not be easy, because it takes giving more of oneself, which sometimes make men appear vulnerable or 'unmanly'. However, we are talking about pleasing and bringing love and joy to the special women in their lives, besides, if they refuse, another man would relish the opportunity. Men know that their women love them (at least I hope they do), and making them feel secure, and needed in relationships and marriages is what make women stand by their man during trying times. If men apply these twelve essential things, I guarantee that their women would be more giving, understanding, sexual and pleasing to be around.",1477605444,9781477605448),Paperback,,90 pages,"

Anche perché, con lui, Ivy può finalmente condividere ogni aspetto della sua vita: Ren infatti è membro dello stesso, antichissimo Ordine di cui fa parte lei, perciò capisce benissimo che cosa voglia dire passare le giornate all'università e le notti a combattere contro il Male che si cela tra le strade di New Orleans. Però tutto cambia nel momento in cui Ivy scopre un segreto che la sua famiglia si tramanda da generazioni, un segreto che non può rivelare ad anima viva, neppure a Ren. Perché, se lui ne venisse a conoscenza, dovrebbe ucciderla. Ben presto, quindi, Ivy sarà costretta a fare una dolorosa scelta: mentire all'uomo che ama e mettere in pericolo tutto ciò per cui hanno lottato insieme, o sacrificare se stessa per la salvezza del mondo intero...",8842929247,9788842929246),Hardcover,Narrativa Nord,368 pages,"

","The study of sexual physiology - what happens, and why, and how to make it happen better - has been a paying career or a diverting sideline for scientists as far-ranging as Leonardo da Vinci and James Watson. The research has taken place behind the closed doors of laboratories, brothels, MRI centers, pig farms, sex-toy R&D labs, and Alfred Kinsey's attic.Mary Roach, ""the funniest science writer in the country"" (Burkhard Bilger of 'The New Yorker'), devoted the past two years to stepping behind those doors. Can a person think herself to orgasm? Can a dead man get an erection? Is vaginal orgasm a myth? Why doesn't Viagra help women or, for that matter, pandas? In 'Bonk', Roach shows us how and why sexual arousal and orgasm, two of the most complex, delightful, and amazing scientific phenomena on earth, can be so hard to achieve and what science is doing to slowly make the bedroom a more satisfying place. 16 illustrations.",0393064646,9780393064643),Hardcover,,319 pages,"

","As Ondas é considerado o melhor e o mais radical romance de Virginia Woolf – um desses raros escritores que nasceu no «instante em que uma estrela se pôs a pensar».Marguerite Yourcenar, sua tradutora francesa, descreveu assim este romance: «As Ondas é um livro com seis personagens, ou melhor seis instrumentos musicais, pois consiste unicamente em monólogos interiores, cujas curvas se sucedem e entrecruzam com uma segurança que lembra A Arte da Fuga de Bach. Nesta narrativa musical, os breves pensamentos de infância, as rápidas reflexões sobre os momentos de juventude e de confiante camaradagem desempenham o mesmo papel dos allegros nas sinfonias de Mozart, abrindo espaço para os lentos andantes dos imensos solilóquios sobre a experiência, a solidão e a maturidade. Tanto como uma meditação sobre a vida, As Ondas são um ensaio sobre a solidão. Trata-se de seis crianças, três raparigas, Rhoda, Jinny e Susan; e de três rapazes, Louis, Neville e Bernard, que vemos crescer, diferenciarem-se e envelhecer. Uma sétima criança, que nunca toma a palavra e que só conhecemos através dos outros, é o centro do livro ou melhor o seu coração.»Mais que uma música admirável que a imaginação oferece à inteligência, As Ondas é um livro sobre a impossibilidade do ser.",9727084362,9727084362,Paperback,,240 pages,"

","From the Booker Prize-winning author of The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans, comes an unforgettable edge-of-your-seat mystery that is at once heartbreakingly tender and morally courageous about what it means to be human.Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.",1400043395,9781400043392),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER • Colum McCann’s beloved novel inspired by Philippe Petit’s daring high-wire stunt, which is also depicted in the film The Walk starring Joseph Gordon-LevittIn the dawning light of a late-summer morning, the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed, staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers. It is August 1974, and a mysterious tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann’s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people.

Let the Great World Spin is the critically acclaimed author’s most ambitious novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise of New York City in the 1970s. Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx. A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways. Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter, determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth. Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic crime of the century.”A sweeping and radical social novel, Let the Great World Spin captures the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.Praise for Let the Great World Spin“This is a gorgeous book, multilayered and deeply felt, and it’s a damned lot of fun to read, too. Leave it to an Irishman to write one of the greatest-ever novels about New York. There’s so much passion and humor and pure lifeforce on every page of Let the Great World Spin that you’ll find yourself giddy, dizzy, overwhelmed.”—Dave Eggers“Stunning . . . [an] elegiac glimpse of hope . . . It’s a novel rooted firmly in time and place. It vividly captures New York at its worst and best. But it transcends all that. In the end, it’s a novel about families—the ones we’re born into and the ones we make for ourselves.”—USA Today “The first great 9/11 novel . . . We are all dancing on the wire of history, and even on solid ground we breathe the thinnest of air.”—Esquire “Mesmerizing . . . a Joycean look at the lives of New Yorkers changed by a single act on a single day . . . Colum McCann’s marvelously rich novel . . . weaves a portrait of a city and a moment, dizzyingly satisfying to read and difficult to put down.”—The Seattle Times “Vibrantly whole . . . With a series of spare, gorgeously wrought vignettes, Colum McCann brings 1970s New York to life. . . . And as always, McCann’s heart-stoppingly simple descriptions wow.”—Entertainment Weekly “An act of pure bravado, dizzying proof that to keep your balance you need to know how to fall.”—O: The Oprah MagazineFrom the Hardcover edition.",0812973992,9780812973990),Paperback,,349 pages,"

A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. Dear Ijeawele is Adichie's letter of response.Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can ""allow"" women to have full careers, Dear Ijeawele goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.",152473313X,9781524733131),Hardcover,,63 pages,"

","The #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove returns with a dazzling, profound novel about a small town with a big dream—and the price required to make it come true.People say Beartown is finished. A tiny community nestled deep in the forest, it is slowly losing ground to the ever encroaching trees. But down by the lake stands an old ice rink, built generations ago by the working men who founded this town. And in that ice rink is the reason people in Beartown believe tomorrow will be better than today. Their junior ice hockey team is about to compete in the national semi-finals, and they actually have a shot at winning. All the hopes and dreams of this place now rest on the shoulders of a handful of teenage boys.Being responsible for the hopes of an entire town is a heavy burden, and the semi-final match is the catalyst for a violent act that will leave a young girl traumatized and a town in turmoil. Accusations are made and, like ripples on a pond, they travel through all of Beartown, leaving no resident unaffected.Beartown explores the hopes that bring a small community together, the secrets that tear it apart, and the courage it takes for an individual to go against the grain. In this story of a small forest town, Fredrik Backman has found the entire world.",,,Kindle Edition,,432 pages,"

","Blurb  Have you ever wondered if we choose our loved ones during our lifetime? Before or after that time? Do you ponder the meaning of your existence? Your destiny? What life would be like if your enemies or rivals didn’t exist at all? Brian Sunderland, whom some might call a “profound researcher,” has been looking for answers to these questions. In fact, his entire life so far has been ruled by this quest, as he journeys through various dilemmas, such as surrendering to true love, his coming of age, fighting, standing up for his rights, helping others, and finally, leaving his mark on this world. In stark contrast, Peter Drake is portrayed quite realistically, as he and a cast of “everyday heroes and heroines,"" including General Grant and Lianne Starling, deal with some extraordinary circumstances, tough times, action-packed scenes, and high drama. Sympathetic characters as well as despicable ones float in and out, yet ultimately, the main intrigue of the story concerns the complex relationships and dynamic interactions that occur between the good guys and the bad. Does each person deserve what he or she gets? Does each person move on with life – or simply fail? Read on to find out.  About the Author  For the time being, Benedict J. Stuart resides in Europe with his girlfriend, taking care of two pets. They are still considered to be relatively young and intelligent. His dreams are mainly about better education, including lifelong learning, raising cultural awareness and improvement of overall human communication worldwide with the help of modern technology. Finally, he is a firm believer in broad general knowledge per se.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Stephen Moles returns with his most complex and rewarding novel yet. All the World's a Simulation is a metafictional tour de force featuring Shakespeare, Snow White and an infinite number of evil Stephen Hawkings. While its main characters attempt to escape from it, the book constantly rewrites itself before the reader's gaze to reveal a profound secret about the power behind this and all other literary works. Thoroughly playful yet deeply serious, this extraordinary novel offers a personality-altering reading experience and an initiation into the realm of dark meaning.

","You may have watched hundreds of episodes of The Simpsons (and its sister show Futurama) without ever realizing that cleverly embedded in many plots are subtle references to mathematics, ranging from well-known equations to cutting-edge theorems and conjectures. That they exist, Simon Singh reveals, underscores the brilliance of the shows' writers, many of whom have advanced degrees in mathematics in addition to their unparalleled sense of humor. While recounting memorable episodes such as “Bart the Genius” and “Homer3,” Singh weaves in mathematical stories that explore everything from p to Mersenne primes, Euler's equation to the unsolved riddle of P v. NP; from perfect numbers to narcissistic numbers, infinity to even bigger infinities, and much more. Along the way, Singh meets members of The Simpsons' brilliant writing team-among them David X. Cohen, Al Jean, Jeff Westbrook, and Mike Reiss-whose love of arcane mathematics becomes clear as they reveal the stories behind the episodes. With wit and clarity, displaying a true fan's zeal, and replete with images from the shows, photographs of the writers, and diagrams and proofs, The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets offers an entirely new insight into the most successful show in television history.",1620402777,9781620402771),Hardcover,,253 pages,"

","A murder . . . a tragic accident . . . or just parents behaving badly? What’s indisputable is that someone is dead. But who did what?Big Little Lies follows three women, each at a crossroads: Madeline is a force to be reckoned with. She’s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline’s youngest (how is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline’s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline’s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?). Celeste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn’t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay. New to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.Big Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.",,,Kindle Edition,,465 pages,"

Now, for the first time, all six exciting parts come together in one volume to let you enjoy Stephen King’s masterpiece uninterrupted, from gripping opening to shattering climax.At Cold Mountain Penitentiary, along the lonely stretch of cells known as the Green Mile, killers as depraved as the psychotic “Billy the Kid” Wharton and the possessed Eduard Delacroix await death strapped in “Old Sparky”. Here guards as decent as Paul Edgecombe and as sadistic as Percy Wetmore watch over them. But good or evil, innocent or guilty, none have ever seen the brutal likes of the new prisoner, John Coffey, sentenced to death for raping and murdering two young girls. Is Coffey the devil in human form? Or is he a far, far different kind of being?There are more wonders in heaven and hell than anyone at Cold Mountain can imagine – as the truth emerges in shock waves that only Stephen King could create and a blast of revelation that will truly blow your mind.",0452278902,9780452278905),Paperback,,465 pages,"

","Alternate Cover Edition can be found here. Bob Johansson has just sold his software company and is looking forward to a life of leisure. There are places to go, books to read, and movies to watch. So it's a little unfair when he gets himself killed crossing the street.  Bob wakes up a century later to find that corpsicles have been declared to be without rights, and he is now the property of the state. He has been uploaded into computer hardware and is slated to be the controlling AI in an interstellar probe looking for habitable planets. The stakes are high: no less than the first claim to entire worlds. If he declines the honor, he'll be switched off, and they'll try again with someone else. If he accepts, he becomes a prime target. There are at least three other countries trying to get their own probes launched first, and they play dirty.  The safest place for Bob is in space, heading away from Earth at top speed. Or so he thinks. Because the universe is full of nasties, and trespassers make them mad - very mad.",,,Kindle Edition,,383 pages,"

","Upoznajte Uvea. On je džangrizalo – jedan od onih koji upiru prstom u ljude koji mu se ne dopadaju kao da su provalnici zatečeni pod njegovim prozorom. Svakog jutra Uve ide u inspekciju po naselju u kom živi. Premešta bicikle i proverava da li je đubre pravilno razvrstano – iako je već nekoliko godina prošlo otkako je razrešen dužnosti predsednika kućnog saveta. Ili otkako je „izvršen prevrat“, kako Uve govori o tome. Ljudi ga zovu „ogorčenim komšijom iz pakla“. Ali zar Uve mora da bude ogorčen samo zbog toga što ne šeta okolo sa osmehom zalepljenim na lice?Međutim, iza njegove mrzovolje i pedanterije skriva se jedna priča i mnogo tuge... I tako, kada komšije koje se useljavaju u susednu kuću jednog novembarskog dana slučajno unište Uveovo poštansko sanduče, iznenada počinje topla priča o odrpanim mačkama, neočekivanom prijateljstvu i drevnoj veštini vožnje auta sa prikolicom. Priča koja će suštinski promeniti jednog čoveka i jedno udruženje stanara.Svakom je potreban komšija kao što je Uve.",,,Paperback,,357 pages,"
