","Quantum theory is so shocking that Einstein could not bring himself to accept it. It is so important that it provides the fundamental underpinning of all modern sciences. Without it, we'd have no computers, no science of molecular biology, no understanding of DNA, no genetic engineering.In Search of Schrodinger's Cat tells the complete story of quantum mechanics, a truth stranger than any fiction. John Gribbin takes us step by step into an even more bizarre and fascinating place, requiring only that we approach it with an open mind. He introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory. He investigates the atom, radiation, time travel, the birth of the universe, super conductors and life itself. And in a world full of its own delights, mysteries and surprises, he searches for Schrodinger's Cat - a search for quantum reality - as he brings every reader to a clear understanding of the most important area of scientific study today - quantum physics.In Search of Schrodinger's Cat is a fascinating and delightful introduction to the strange world of the quantum - an essential element in understanding today's world."

","In this eagerly anticipated sequel to the classic bestseller In Search of Schrodinger's Cat, John Gribbin digs even deeper into the mysterious and confounding world of quantum mechanics. Gribbin takes infinitely complex, mind-bending experiments, brings them to life, and makes them accessible to the lay reader. Under his deft guidance, we can begin to grasp the fundamental riddle of today's quantum mechanics: how a single photon can be seen going in two directions at once. Along the way, Gribbin reveals some fascinating discoveries: how quantum particles could one day be used in a Star Trek-type teleportation system, and how quantum cryptographers have developed ways of making unbreakable codes using quantum effects.Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality illuminates the world's most intriguing and enigmatic scientific phenomenon - and shows how the ""impossible dreams"" of such legendary scientists as Bohr, Feynman, and Einstein may soon become reality."

","Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of justice is radical. Justice, inSchopenhauer's system of thought, is not an epistemologicalconstruct. It is neither rights based nor process based. It rejects theconcept of individual moral duty as vehemently as it embraces theconcept of collective moral guilt. For Schopenhauer, justice is not away of assessing reality. It is a facet of reality itself. Schopenhauer'stheory of justice is ontology - a study of being itself. In this bookRaymond B. Marcin offers several reasons why a review and areevaluation of Schopenhauer's theory of justice are worthwhile now, almost two hundred years after it was first formulated"

Following the loss of his best friend and sidekick, Mouse, he wants to set an example for his children by earning an honest living. But trouble has a way of finding Easy on the mean streets of Watts. Easy wanders from schoolhouse to whorehouse as he is drawn into investigating the torching of Sojourner Truth, the Junior High School where he works, then the turning over of a local garage and the death of a prostitute. But no man is an island... His job, his lover, his comfortable house and the children he cherishes all count for nothing when the phone rings and a woman asks if he knows where Mouse is. Easy soon discovers that Mouse is as much of a moral challenge dead as alive.

Six Easy Pieces is confirmation that Mosley?s vision continues to stretch and redefine the American canon."

","This Very Short Introduction introduces readers to the key concepts of political philosophy: authority, democracy, freedom and its limits, justice, feminism, multiculturalism, and nationality. Accessibly written and assuming no previous knowledge of the subject, it encourages the reader to think clearly and critically about the leading political questions of our time.Miller first investigates how political philosophy tackles basic ethical questions such as 'how should we live together in society?' He furthermore looks at political authority, discusses the reasons society needs politics in the first place, explores the limitations of politics, and asks if there are areas of life that shouldn't be governed by politics. Moreover, he explores the connections between political authority and justice, a constant theme in political philosophy, and the ways in which social justice can be used to regulate rather than destroy a market economy.In his travels through this realm, Miller covers why nations are the natural units of government and wonders if the rise of multiculturalism and transnational co-operation will change all this, and asks in the end if we will ever see the formation of a world government.About the Series: Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, Very Short Introductions offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.
