","For the millions of readers fascinated by Dan Brown's revelations about Mary Magdalen in The Da Vinci Code, here, at last, is their chance to meet the Gospel's most provocative woman face to face-on her own terms.Make way for a new Magdalen. Born on a Celtic isle to eight warrior-witch mothers, Maeve is raised to be as brave as any hero. In her stubborn, enchanting voice, she recounts her perilous quest for the young man, Esus, whose life she once saved from druid sacrifice. Captured and sold to a Roman Madam, Maeve is sustained by a fierce sense of identity, compassion for her sister whores, and her unquenchable love. When she wins her freedom and finds her lost lover, a stormy life begins for both as we follow the Passion story through the eyes of Jesus's partner. By turns feisty and funny, outrageous and tender, this Celtic Mary Magdalen challenges all stereotypes, both old and New Age, and brings us to transforming encounter with the divine feminine made flesh.",0976684330,9780976684336),Paperback,,640 pages,"

","They know who did it. Perhaps not consciously. Perhaps not yet. But they know. When eight-year-old Daisy Mason vanishes from her family’s Oxford home during a costume party, Detective Inspector Adam Fawley knows that nine times out of ten, the offender is someone close to home. And Daisy’s family is certainly strange—her mother is obsessed with keeping up appearances, while her father is cold and defensive under questioning. And then there’s Daisy’s little brother, so withdrawn and uncommunicative . . .  DI Fawley works against the clock to find any trace of the little girl, but it’s as if she disappeared into thin air—no one saw anything; no one knows anything.

Mentre nel campo internazionale si accresce la sua esperienza con il soggiorno a Mosca e a Vienna, nella costruzione del partito, condotta nel vivo della lotta antifascista, si afferma la sua linea con le Tesi di Lione, che concludono questo volume.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,305 pages,"

","Chi è Eloise Weiss? Perché il più antico vampiro della stirpe di Blackmore abbandona per lei l’eternità suscitando le ire di Axel Vandemberg, glaciale Princeps dello Studium e tormentato amore della giovane? La Vecchia Capitale si prepara alla Vigilia di Ognissanti e il coprifuoco è vicino perché il Presidio sta per aprire le sue porte. Il lento salmodiare delle orde di penitenti che si riversano per le vie, in cerca di anime da punire, è il segnale per gli abitanti di affrettarsi nelle proprie case, ma per Eloise Weiss è già troppo tardi. Scambiata per una vampira, cade vittima dell’irrazionalità di una fede che brucia ogni cosa al suo passaggio. In fin di vita esala una richiesta d’aiuto che giunge alle soglie della tomba dove Ashton Blackmore, un redivivo secolare, riposa protetto dalle ombre della Cattedrale di Black Friars. Il richiamo della ragazza è un sussurro che si trasforma in ordine, irrompe nella sua mente e lo riporta alla vita. Nobili vampiri di vecchie casate, spiriti reclusi e guerrieri, eroici umani e passioni che il tempo non è riuscito a cancellare: Black Friars – L’ordine della Spada è un mondo nuovo che profuma di antico, un romanzo che si ammanta di gotico per condurre il lettore tra i vicoli della Vecchia Capitale o negli antri del Presidio, in un viaggio che continua oltre la carta e non finisce con l’ultima pagina.",8876250794,9788876250798),Hardcover,Lain #73,682 pages,"

As her sympathy for the town’s mill workers grows, her sense of social injustice piques and she passionately fights their corner. However, just as she disputes the mill owner, John Thornton’s treatment of his workers, she cannot deny her growing attraction to him. Highlighting the changing landscape of nineteenth-century Britain and championing the role of women in Victorian society, Gaskell brilliantly captures the lives of ordinary people through one of her strongest female characters in literature.",0007902255,9780007902255),Paperback,Collins Classics,565 pages,"

","The great Indian epic rendered in modern proseIndia's most beloved and enduring legend, the Ramayana is widely acknowledged to be one of the world's great literary masterpieces. Still an integral part of India's cultural and religious expression, the Ramayana was originally composed by the Sanskrit poet Valmiki around 300 b.c. The epic of Prince Rama's betrayal, exile, and struggle to rescue his faithful wife, Sita, from the clutches of a demon and to reclaim his throne has profoundly affected the literature, art, and culture of South and Southeast Asia-an influence most likely unparalleled in the history of world literature, except, possibly, for the Bible. Throughout the centuries, countless versions of the epic have been produced in numerous formats and languages. But previous English versions have been either too short to capture the magnitude of the original; too secular in presenting what is, in effect, scripture; or dry, line-by-line translations. Now novelist Ramesh Menon has rendered the tale in lyrical prose that conveys all the beauty and excitement of the original, while making this spiritual and literary classic accessible to a new generation of readers.",8172764065,9788172764067),,,,,"['Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Religion', 'Cultural', 'India', 'Poetry', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Spirituality', 'Literature', 'Philosophy']"

","This is the definitive visual biography of Barack Obama's presidency, captured in intimate, unprecedented detail by his official White House photographer.Pete Souza began photographing President Obama on his first day as a U.S. senator, in January 2005, and served as the chief official White House photographer for the President's full two terms. Souza was with President Obama more often, and at more crucial moments, than any friend or staff member, or even the First Lady--and he photographed it all. Souza captured nearly 2 million photographs of Obama, in moments ranging from classified to disarmingly candid.This large-format (12""x10""), exquisitely produced book presents more than 300 of Souza's favorite and most iconic images from these historic years; many have never been seen before. This seminal work on the Obama presidency documents moments of national importance--including the historic image of the President and his advisors watching tensely in the Situation Room as the Bin Laden mission unfolded--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his many encounters with children, and his time spent interacting with world leaders, members of Congress, White House staff, artists, musicians and more.The photographs are paired with captions and stories providing behind-the-scenes context for each, and offer insight into the special relationship Souza and the President forged during their time together. The result is a stunning record of a landmark era in American history.Souza's work enabled us to feel that we knew the President. This book puts us in the White House with him.",English,English,Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","A ruthless young assassin continues her journey for revenge in this new epic fantasy from New York Times bestselling author Jay Kristoff.Assassin Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church ministry think she’s far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she’s no closer to ending Consul Scaeva and Cardinal Duomo, or avenging her familia. And after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia begins to suspect the motives of the Red Church itself.When it’s announced that Scaeva and Duomo will be making a rare public appearance at the conclusion of the grand games in Godsgrave, Mia defies the Church and sells herself to a gladiatorial collegium for a chance to finally end them. Upon the sands of the arena, Mia finds new allies, bitter rivals, and more questions about her strange affinity for the shadows. But as conspiracies unfold within the collegium walls, and the body count rises, Mia will be forced to choose between loyalty and revenge, and uncover a secret that could change the very face of her world.Set in the world of Nevernight, which Publishers Weekly called “absorbing in its complexity and bold in its bloodiness,” Godsgrave will continue to thrill and satisfy fantasy fans everywhere.",B06X3VBJ21,B06X3VBJ21,Kindle Edition,,448 pages,"

","Tóth Árpád: Karinthy Frigyes: GrimaszA magyar újság-croquis egyike a nálunk termett és fejlődött legsajátosabb irodalmi műfajoknak. Első mesterei és későbbi továbbfejlesztői különös munkát végeztek, körülbelül olyat, mint a Vigadó-palota zseniális építője, aki úgy akart magyar stílust teremteni, hogy kelet és nyugat egy-egy jellegzetes építő stílusát, a mórt és a románt keverte. Nem ily öntudatosan, de körülbelül ezzel a módszerrel dolgoztak a magyar szellemesség irodalmi kifejezői is: keletről hozott, kényelmes, vitézkötéses, anekdotás humorunkat franciáktól tanult fogásokkal tették modernebbé, csattanóbbá, finomabbá. Két nevet említek, a Mikszáthét és Heltaiét, a két legkitűnőbb mesterét: az egyik még talán túlságos táblabírós zamatú, a másik már talán túlságosan is francia. De mindkettőben főtulajdonság: a bölcs derű és a finomság, a szatíra náluk inkább csak pikáns árnyalat!A legújabb magyar újság-croquis-k erős fordulatot mutatnak: a bölcs mosolyból kegyetlen grimasz lett. Már Molnár Ferenc croquis-cikkei is ezt a fordulatot éreztetik, de legteljesebben Karinthy Frigyes szokatlan merészségű és erejű ilynemű művei rajzolják elénk az új magyar croquis képét. Molnárnál még némi bujkáló líra enyhíti olykor a maró viccet, Karinthynál teljes fölényével és kegyetlenségével lép elő a szatíra. Croquis-cikkei olvasásakor fantasztikus, már-már félelmes méretekig lendülő cirkuszi bohóc víziója elevenedik elém, egy krétás arcú vigyorgóé, aki pofonokat oszt, fejeket tép le, amiket fordítva, eltorzítva ragaszt vissza, s olykor a csillagokig nyúl, hogy azokkal mutasson be groteszk és döbbenetes tréfákat.Karinthy szokatlan sikerének kétségkívül az a titka, hogy bár kegyetlen s bár igen gyakran a croquis szerény korlátain szinte brutális erővel veti túl magát heves lendülete, mindvégig kacagtató tud maradni. A mulattató helyzetek variálásában, a nevettető torzítás biztosságában elsőrangú, s a croquis-nyelv kezelésében szinte páratlan. A furcsa, alakuló budapesti nyelv bravúros kezelője, s akárhányszor avatott továbbfejlesztője is. Némely fordulata, egy-egy alakjának neve szájról szájra száll, s olyanok szókincsébe is beiktatódik, akik talán nem is olvasták croquis-jait.Karinthy szatirikus cikkei - melyek közül legújabb kötetében, a Grimasz címűben, talán a legjellegzetesebbeket gyűjtötte össze - a maguk módján pompás kifejezői napjaink szellemének, az író kitűnő hivatottságát mi sem mutatja jobban, minthogy ez a kifejezőerő egy jelentéktelenebb műfaj keretében is oly dúsan adatott meg neki.",Hungarian,Hungarian,ebook,,,"

The peace campaigners who undertook this direct action took the unprecedented step of suing the British government under international law for crimes against humanity. What emerges is an extraordinary story with the most wide-ranging implications of any act of disarmament since the formation of the anti-nuclear movement. This book is written by the man closest to the Trident Three—their lawyer. Using the highest laws in the world—the Nuremberg Principles and the reasoning handed down by the World Court—John Mayer’s argument persuaded independent judiciary that nuclear weapons lie outside the bounds of international law.,1904132049,9781904132042),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Born into “the blessings of liberty in a free State,” Solomon Northup was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Bayou Boeuf region of Louisiana’s Red River Valley. Twelve Years a Slave is the chronicle of his captivity at the mercy of sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps, who tested Northup’s tenacity and self-control under the most brutal conditions. Until fate brought a Canadian abolitionist to Epps’s farm, Northup thought he would never draw another free breath.To this day Northup’s harrowing memoir is recognized as the most reliable, accurate eyewitness account of the daily lives of slaves. As a significant historical reference, it is unsurpassed. As an authentic narrative of a man starved of his freedom, it is unforgettable.AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors.

In the months that followed, ten thousand men--trained and hardened in three decades of war in Greece--would engage in pitched battles, witness untold horrors, and begin a desperate march across he desert, over raging rivers, and into the jaws of hell itself. By the time it was over, some would be alive, others dead, and one among them would emerge and the greatest hero of all...In a novel of high adventure and riveting historical drama, Michael Curtis Ford brings to life an amazing true story from Greek antiquity--Xenophon's march of the ten Thousand. A tale of war and peace, of loyalties and betrayals, and of a soldier's love for a mysterious and dangerous woman, The Ten Thousand captures the eternal spirit of courage--in the face of impossible odds.",0312980329,9780312980320),Mass Market Paperback,,466 pages,"

Lucy can’t understand Joshua’s joyless, uptight, meticulous approach to his job. Joshua is clearly baffled by Lucy’s overly bright clothes, quirkiness, and Pollyanna attitude.Now up for the same promotion, their battle of wills has come to a head and Lucy refuses to back down when their latest game could cost her her dream job…But the tension between Lucy and Joshua has also reached its boiling point, and Lucy is discovering that maybe she doesn’t hate Joshua.

","Among all the texts and notes of Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), there was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained the transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book of Zohar and of many other works on Kabbalah. Not feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash summoned his prime disciple and personal assistant, Michael Laitman, to his bedside and handed him that notebook. Its cover contained only one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said to Laitman, ""Take it and learn from it."" The following morning, he perished in his student?s arms, leaving him and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. Committed to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, Laitman published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's transforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique and compelling composition whose power persists long after the reading is through.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,410 pages,"

","Sétimo livro da série Outlander, Ecos do Futuro vai além da jornada de Claire e Jamie, apresentando outras três tramas paralelas. Enquanto o casal de protagonistas se vê às voltas com a Revolução Americana e a perspectiva de voltar para o Velho Mundo, Brianna e Roger, acompanhados dos filhos, tentam se readaptar à vida no século XX, para a qual acabam de retornar. Simultaneamente, Diana Gabaldon acompanha a trajetória de William Ransom, o filho adotado de Lord John Grey, ao ingressar no exército britânico para lutar contra os americanos. Para completar, o sobrinho de Jamie, Ian Murray, ganha uma história própria, tão intrincada quanto as demais.Não bastasse o inverno tenebroso pelo qual estão passando e todos os sombrios acontecimentos recentes, logo no início da trama a autora expõe Jamie e Ian a uma situação nada confortável, relacionada ao ouro roubado no último livro. A dupla acaba se envolvendo em um crime e Ian é jurado de morte. Em meio a tudo isso, ele terá de acompanhar a saída do tio e de Claire da Carolina do Norte em direção aos Highlands, onde Jamie pretende retomar a gráfica que deixou para trás, mas até isso se tornar realidade ainda há muito a ser enfrentado.Paralelamente, William Ransom passa por situações tragicômicas no exército britânico, assim como é desafiado constantemente. Durante sua trajetória enfrentando os americanos, William acaba cruzando com Ian Murray. Nesta altura da história um dos maiores receios de Jamie é deparar-se com William, seu filho criado pelo amigo John Grey, protagonista de outra série assinada por Diana Gabaldon. Diferente de outros livros, em Ecos do Futuro os integrantes da nova geração ganham um espaço considerável na história.Enquanto tudo isso transcorre no século XVIII, Roger e Brianna descobrem uma caixa de cartas de Claire e Jamie, as quais vão lendo aos poucos, como se a história relatada pelos pais estivesse apenas terminado de acontecer. Esta parece ser uma forma encontrada pela autora para manter a conexão entre as duas famílias, mesmo que agora elas estejam separadas por mais de 200 anos no tempo. Também é um ótimo recurso para relatar eventos vividos por Claire e Jamie sem se alongar muito.Assim como em capítulos anteriores da série, Diana Gabaldon inclui personalidades reais na trama, como Benjamin Franklin ou Benedict Arnold, além de fatos históricos nos quais seus personagens se envolvem. Além dos famosos, a autora oferece aos leitores uma série de personagens com papéis menores, mas que ajudam a dar a sustentação à trama, dividida em duas partes. Mantendo o estilo que conquistou milhões de leitores em todo o mundo, Diana Gabaldon mistura romance, suspense e disputas de poder numa narrativa que mantém a tensão e a emoção do início ao fim.",Portuguese,Portuguese,Paperback,,448 pages,"

","From Taylor Jenkins Reid, “a genius when it comes to stories about life and love” (Redbook), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress’s relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Written with Reid’s signature talent for “creating complex, likable characters” (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",9781501174827,9781501174827,Paperback,Canadian,391 pages,"

","A PRESCIENT POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER RIPPED FROM TOMORROW'S HEADLINES, BY ONE OF GERMANY'S MOST CELEBRATED CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTSA few short years from now, the world is an even more uncertain place than it is today, and politics everywhere is marching rightward: Trump is gone, but Brexit is complete, as is Frexit. There's a global financial crisis, armed conflict, and mass migration, and an ultrapopulist movement governs in Germany. With their democracy facing the wrecking ball, most well-off Germans, turn inward, focusing on their own lives. Britta, a wife, mother, and successful businesswoman, ignores the daily news and concentrates on her family and her work running a clinic specializing in suicide prevention.But her legitimate business is connected to a secret and far more lucrative operation known as The Bridge, an outfit that supplies terrorist organizations looking to employ suicide bombers. Using a complex candidate-identifying algorithm designed by Babak, a brilliant programmer and Britta's only employee, The Bridge has effectively cornered the market, and terrorism almost never takes place without Britta's services - which is why news of a thwarted suicide attack in Leipzig comes as a shock. Then The Bridge's database is stolen, driving Britta, Babak, and their latest recruit into hiding. On their heels is a new terrorist organization called Empty Hearts, a group unlike any Britta and Babak have encountered before.Part suspenseful thriller, part wickedly effective social satire, 'Empty Hearts' is a novel for our times, examining urgent questions of morality, politics, and culture and presenting a startling vision of a future where empathy is a thing of the past.©2019 Juli Zeh and John Cullen (P)2019 Random House Audio",3630875238,9783630875231),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","In the 1880s, as the European powers were carving up Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo--too long forgotten--onto the conscience of the West",B004KZOWEG,B004KZOWEG,Kindle Edition,,402 pages,"

","American Power and the New Mandarins is Noam Chomsky’s first political book, widely considered to be among the most cogent and powerful statements against the American war in Vietnam. Long out of print, this collection of early, seminal essays helped to establish Chomsky as a leading critic of United States foreign policy. These pages mount a scathing critique of the contradictions of the war, and an indictment of the mainstream, liberal intellectuals—the “new mandarins”—who furnished what Chomsky argued was the necessary ideological cover for the horrors visited on the Vietnamese people.As America’s foreign entanglements deepen by the month, Chomsky’s lucid analysis is a sobering reminder of the perils of imperial diplomacy. With a new foreword by Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States, American Power and the New Mandarins is a renewed call for independent analysis of America’s role in the world.",156584775X,9781565847750),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Titelheldin der abenteuerlichen Erzählung Das Schneekind ist Montaine Vanier, die 18 Monate alte Tochter des Autors. Im zarten Kleinkindalter begleitete sie ihr Eltern ins ewige Eis des Nordens. Ihr Vater, Nicolas Vanier, war schon immer fasziniert von weiten Schneelandschaften: Er bereiste Lappland, Sibirien, Alaska und Kanada und wurde mit seiner ersten Schlittenhundfahrt quer über den amerikanischen Kontinent -- der weißen Odyssee -- weltbekannt. So erfüllte sich für ihn ein Traum, als der lang gehegte Plan, sich für ein ganzes Jahr in die endlos weite Einsamkeit zurückzuziehen, tatsächlich Gestalt annimmt. Dass das Familienabenteuer dann keineswegs so glatt abläuft, wie sich die beiden das vorgestellt hatten, tröstet all jene, die an derart abenteuerliche Unternehmungen gar nicht zu denken wagen. Klirrende Dauerkälte und die Mückenschwärme des kurzen Polarsommers, den die Vaniers nutzen, um ein Blockhaus zu bauen, die mühsame Jagd nach Schneeziegen, die Gefahren der Schneeschmelze, hungrige Grislibären und Temperaturen um -40 Grad Celsius, pfeifende Winterstürme und tückisches Packeis machen das Leben im hohen Norden hart: Bis an die Grenzen der eigenen Kraft muss das Paar gehen, um der Natur Nahrung, Wärme und ein Auskommen abzutrotzen. Dennoch überwiegen die Momente des Glücks bei der Suche nach dem Einswerden mit der Natur, kommt eine Klarheit und Poesie zum Vorschein, die in der Zivilisation kaum so intensiv zu empfinden ist. So wundert es nicht, dass auch für die kleine Montaine der Ausflug in die Kälte eine prägende Erfahrung wird, an der der Leser dank der ebenso liebevollen wie aufmerksamen Beobachtung der Eltern Anteil nimmt. Eine Reihe stimmungsvoller Fotos vermittelt Impressionen vom Familienleben in der Wildnis. Übrigens: Nicolas Vanier, der wie sein Vorbild Jack London eine Mischung aus Abenteurer und Schriftsteller sein möchte, lebt heute als Züchter von Schlittenhunden und Publizist in Frankreich und Kanada und bietet abenteuerliche Touren in den Norden des Québec an. --Dorothea Fröhlich",3492237207,9783492237208),Paperback,,351 pages,"

","The very title of the present volume calls for some initial explanation, if what it means is to be clearly understood and all misrepresentation prevented. Many no longer doubt the possibility of a world crisis, taking the latter word in its most usual acceptation, and this in itself marks a very noticeable change of outlook: by sheer force of circumstance certain illusions are beginning to vanish, and we cannot but rejoice that this is so, for it is at any rate a favorable symptom and a sign that a readjustment of the contemporary mentality is still possible— a glimmer of light as it were— in the midst of the present chaos. For example, the belief in a never-ending ‘progress’, which until recently was held as a sort of inviolable and indisputable dogma, is no longer so widespread; there are those who perceive, though in a vague and confused manner, that the civilization of the West may not always go on developing in the same direction, but may some day reach a point where it will stop, or even be plunged in its entirety into some cataclysm. Such persons may not see clearly where the danger lies— the fantastic or puerile fears they sometimes express being proof enough that their minds still harbor many errors— but it is already something that they realize there is a danger, even if it is felt rather than understood; and it is also something that they can conceive that this civilization, with which the moderns are so infatuated, holds no privileged position in the history of the world, and may easily encounter the same fate as has befallen many others that have already disappeared at more or less remote periods, some of them having left traces so slight as to be hardly noticeable, let alone recognizable.",0900588241,9780900588242),Paperback,,120 pages,"

This'll be the third boyfriend Ayoola's dispatched in, quote, self-defence and the third mess that her lethal little sibling has left Korede to clear away.

St. Peter's Square, Rome. White smoke signals that a new Pope has been chosen. Is it possible that the new Pope...is a woman?
The world is watching as historic crowds gather in Rome, waiting for news of a new Pope, one who promises to be unlike any other in the Church's history. Some followers are ecstatic, but the leading candidate has made a legion of powerful enemies. From a difficult childhood with drug addled parents, to a career as a doctor on the front lines in Sudan, to a series of trials that test her faith at every turn, Brigid Fitzgerald's convictions and callings have made her the target of all those who fear that the Church has lost its way--dangerous adversaries who abhor challenges to tradition. Locked in a deadly, high-stakes battle with forces determined to undermine everything she believes in, Brigid must convert her enemies to her cause before she loses her faith...and her life.",031627402X,9780316274029),Hardcover,,362 pages,"

","Dr. Amin Jaafari, an Arab-Israeli citizen, is a surgeon at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion, The Attack portrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.",2266162691,9782266162692),Mass Market Paperback,,246 pages,"

","Charles Dicken's Great Expectations is at once a superbly constructed novel of spellbinding mystery and a profound examination of moral values. An orphan living with his older sister and her kindly husband, Pip is hired by wealthy and embittered Miss Havisham as a companion for her and her beautiful adopted daughter, Estella. His years in service to the Havishams fill his heart with the desire to rise above his station in life. Pip's wish is fulfilled when a mysterious benefactor provides him with ""great expectations"" -the means to be tutored as a gentleman.Thrust into London's high-society circles, Pip grows accustomed to a life of leisure, only to find himself lacking as a suitor competing for Estella's favor. After callously discarding everything he once valued for his own selfish pursuits, Pip learns the identity of his patron -a revelation that shatters his very soul.From the agony of Dicken's disenchantment with the Victorian middle class comes a work that gives an added dimension to his matchless genius.",English,English,Paperback,,508 pages,"

","She has no allies. No throne. All she has is what she’s always had: herself.After failing to secure the Wallachian throne, Lada Dracul is out to punish anyone who dares to cross her blood-strewn path. Filled with a white-hot rage, she storms the countryside with her men, accompanied by her childhood friend Bogdan, terrorizing the land. But brute force isn’t getting Lada what she wants. And thinking of Mehmed brings little comfort to her thorny heart. There’s no time to wonder whether he still thinks about her, even loves her. She left him before he could leave her. What Lada needs is her younger brother Radu’s subtlety and skill. But Mehmed has sent him to Constantinople—and it’s no diplomatic mission. Mehmed wants control of the city, and Radu has earned an unwanted place as a double-crossing spy behind enemy lines. Radu longs for his sister’s fierce confidence—but for the first time in his life, he rejects her unexpected plea for help. Torn between loyalties to faith, to the Ottomans, and to Mehmed, he knows he owes Lada nothing. If she dies, he could never forgive himself—but if he fails in Constantinople, will Mehmed ever forgive him? As nations fall around them, the Dracul siblings must decide: what will they sacrifice to fulfill their destinies? Empires will topple, thrones will be won…and souls will be lost.",0553522353,9780553522358),Hardcover,,471 pages,"

While BEYOND is a stand-alone novel, we want to warn potential readers that the copy below contains serious spoilers for THE ICE LIMIT, for those who wish to read that book first.That thing is growing again. We must destroy it. The time to act is now...With these words begins Gideon Crew's latest, most dangerous, most high-stakes assignment yet. Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on earth.Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite--the largest ever discovered--from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the Rolvaag, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking-along with its unique cargo-to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed.But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead, it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space.Now, that organism has implanted itself in the sea bed two miles below the surface-and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task which requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the ""meteorite"" has a mind of its own-and it has no intention of going quietly...

Or at least she thought it was…until two police officers showed up at her door with devastating news. Her husband of eight years, the one who should have been on a business trip to Kansas, had suffered a fatal car accident in Hawaii. And he wasn’t alone.For Jacks, laying her husband to rest was hard. But it was even harder to think that his final moments belonged to another woman—one who had left behind her own grieving and bewildered fiancé. Nick, just as blindsided by the affair, wants answers. So he suggests that he and Jacks search for the truth together, retracing the doomed lovers’ last days in paradise.Now, following the twisting path of that fateful road, Jacks is learning that nothing is ever as it seems.

","Described by the Dalai Lama as ""one of the greatest thinkers of the age"", Jiddu Krishnamurti has influenced millions throughout the twentieth century -- including such notables as Joseph Campbell, Dr. Jonas Salk, Aldous Huxley, Van Morrison, Bertrand Russell, Henry Miller, and Bruce Lee -- and his work continues to inspire even a decade after his death. Born of middle-class Brahmin parents in 1895, Krishnamurti was recognized at age fourteen by Theosophists Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater as the anticipated world teacher and proclaimed to be the vehicle for the reincarnation of Christ in the West and of Buddha in the East. In 1929 he repudiated these claims and traveled the world, sharing his philosophical insights and establishing schools and foundations.Because Krishnamurti had no interest in presenting theories, his thought is far removed from academic philosophy in the analytic tradition, yet his insights remain extremely relevant to contemporary philosophical theories and to people who are passionately interested in understanding themselves and the world. Rather than a theorist, Krishnamurti was a seer and a teacher. He saw inherently distorting psychological structures that bring about a division in every person's consciousness between ""the observer"" and ""the observed"". This division, he believed, is a potent source of conflict -- both internally for the individual and through the individual externalized for society as a whole. Krishnamurti envisioned a radical transformation in human consciousness and offered a way to transcend these harmful structures.Krishnamurti: Reflections on the Self is a collection of Krishnamurti's writings and lectures about the individual inrelation to society. In Reflections, he examines the importance of inquiry, the role of emotions, the relation between experience and the self, the observer/observed distinction, the nature of freedom, and other philosophical ideas.""In my own life Krishnamurti influenced me profoundly and helped me personally break through the confines of my own restrictions to my freedom"". -- Deepak Chopra, M.D.",0812693558,9780812693553),Paperback,,234 pages,"

","Interroger le fanatisme de la vérité qui gouverne la philosophie, reconnaître la vie seule pour source de toute valeur, l'indépendance pour la vertu suprême du philosophe, et rechercher une réconciliation inédite de l'art et de la science: tel est pour Nietzsche le sens du gai savoir, de l'idée provençale de 'gaya scienza', cette unité du troubadour, du chevalier et de l'esprit libre par laquelle cette magnifique culture ancienne des Provençaux se distingue de toutes les cultures équivoques.  Unité de l'amor fati et de la philosophie de Dionysos, le gai savoir est la philosophie du oui à la vie, engendrée par la reconnaissance et l'acquiescement, qui culmine dans la pensée de l'éternel retour, présentée ici pour la première fois.  Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche Prononciation du titre dans sa version originale Écouter (prononcé [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːt͡sʃə], souvent francisé en [nit͡ʃ ]) est un philologue, philosophe et poète allemand né le 15 octobre 1844 à Röcken, en Prusse, et mort le 25 août 1900 à Weimar, en Allemagne.

","Individuals sometimes derive sexual pleasure from submission to cruel discipline. While that predilection was noted as early as the sixteenth century, masochism was not codified as a concept until 1890. According to John K. Noyes, its invention reflected a crisis in the liberal understanding of subjectivity and sexuality which continues to inform discussions of masochism today. In essence, it remains a political concept.Viennese physician Richard yon Krafft-Ebing coined the term masochism, based on the work of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Noyes analyzes the social and political problems that inspired the concept, suggesting, for example, that the triumphant expansion of European colonialism was in part animated by an ambivalence in masculine sexuality.Noyes documents the evolution of the concept of masochism with scenes in literature from John Cleland's Fanny Hill through Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs and Pauline Reage's Story of O. Analysis of Freud's vastly influential rereading of masochism precedes an exploration of the work of his successors, including Wilhem Reich, Theodor Reik, Helene Deutsch, and Karen Horney. Noyes suggests that the thematics of feminine masochism emerged only gradually from an exclusively male concept.",0801433452,9780801433450),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels.

","The Father of Jesus is the only One True God. And he has only one person—not three.  As the son of the king shares in the ‘royalty’ of his father but not in his father’s person, so do Jesus and the Holy Spirit share in the ‘divinity’ of God, but not in God’s person.  God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three distinct and separate persons sharing in one divinity, with the Father of Jesus as being the “Almighty God,” Jesus as being the “Divine Son of God,” and the Holy Spirit as being the “Divine Spirit of God.”  Another thing, Jesus is inherently divine—not human. He is divine made man, not man made divine.   And even during the time that he was living in the world as man, his divinity was yet all perfectly intact with him as God’s Son.Amen.",English,English,ebook,,76 pages,"

Now he has a new goal:  lift the shroud on his past. Why had he been turned and abandoned by his sire? Why didn’t he feel the initial bond between sire and child that vampires experience?

","Nel 1914 Vera Brittain si affaccia alla giovinezza. È brillante e anticonformista, decisa a cambiare un destino di moglie gentile e madre paziente diventando una delle prime donne ammesse in un selettivo college di Oxford. Con l'egocentrismo dei suoi vent'anni, inizialmente Vera considera la grande guerra soprattutto una scomoda interruzione delle proprie attività. Ma la portata degli eventi che stanno travolgendo l'Europa diventa presto chiara: la devastazione non è solo materiale, ma anche psicologica e spirituale. Lasciata Oxford, Vera diventa infermiera volontaria e serve la patria a Londra, a Malta, in Francia, mentre il fratello, il fidanzato, gli amici più cari perdono la vita nelle trincee. Sopravvivere a tutto e tornare a un nuovo genere di ""normalità"" non sarà facile. Dopo una risurrezione difficile ma necessaria, divenuta scrittrice e giornalista, Vera raccoglie le sue memorie in quest'opera incisiva e struggente, testamento ideale e tributo alla sua generazione. Il libro è un classico della letteratura inglese, perché attraverso la propria storia, vivida e sincera, Vera non racconta soltanto la disillusione e il dolore, ma anche il cammino di maturazione delle idee per le quali ha combattuto tutta la vita, armata solo della sua penna: pacifismo e lotta per i diritti delle donne.",8809804538,9788809804531),Hardcover,Narrativa non fiction,640 pages,"

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price.

A tutte le domande che queste figure leggendarie suscitano, Arthur Golden ha risposto con un romanzo, profondamente documentato, che conserva tutta l’immediatezza e l’emozione di una storia vera. Che cosa significa essere una geisha lo apprendiamo così dalla voce di Sayuri che ci racconta la sua storia: l’infanzia, il rapimento, l’addestramento, la disciplina – tutte le vicende che, sullo sfondo del Giappone del ‘900, l’hanno condotta a diventare la geisha più famosa e ricercata.

The other has lost the game before it's barely begun. When ""Verity"" is arrested by the Gestapo, she's sure she doesn't stand a chance. As a secret agent captured in enemy territory, she's living a spy's worst nightmare. Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane. On each new scrap of paper, Verity battles for her life, confronting her views on courage and failure and her desperate hope to make it home. But will trading her secrets be enough to save her from the enemy? Harrowing and beautifully written, Elizabeth Wein creates a visceral read of danger, resolve, and survival that shows just how far true friends will go to save each other.

","Northern Lights introduces Lyra, an orphan, who lives in a parallel universe in which science, theology and magic are entwined. Lyra's search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children and turns into a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. In The Subtle Knife she is joined on her journey by Will, a boy who possesses a knife that can cut windows between worlds. As Lyra learns the truth about her parents and her prophesied destiny, the two young people are caught up in a war against celestial powers that ranges across many worlds and leads to a thrilling conclusion in The Amber Spyglass.The epic story Pullman tells is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armoured polar bears, magical devices, witches and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound re-imagining of Milton's Paradise Lost. An utterly entrancing blend of metaphysical speculation and bravura storytelling, HIS DARK MATERIALS is a monumental and enduring achievement.",1841593427,9781841593425),Hardcover,Everyman's Library #342,1102 pages,"

","A prominent Viennese psychiatrist before the war, Viktor Frankl was uniquely able to observe the way that both he and others in Auschwitz coped (or didn't) with the experience. He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the concentration camp prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Frankl came to believe man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.",B00EKOC0HI,B00EKOC0HI,Kindle Edition,,160 pages,"

",Galardonada con el prestigioso premio Goncourt des Lyceens 2007 e instalada en las listas de libros mas vendidos desde su publicacion esta ultima novela de Philippe Claudel continua la senda iniciada en Almas grises: la investigacion de los claroscuros del alma humana. Apenas ha transcurrido un ano desde el final de la guerra cuando una muerte rompe la tranquilidad de un pequeno pueblo perdido en las montanas. El unico extranjero del lugar a quien llaman Der Anderer el Otro en aleman ha sido asesinado y todos los hombres de la localidad se confiesan autores del crimen. Todos menos Brodeck quien recibe el encargo de redactar un informe sobre lo sucedido para que quienes lo lean puedan comprender y perdonar . Asi pues Brodeck entrevista a los hombres mas importantes del pueblo: el cura el dueno de la fonda el alcalde... Y cuando este ultimo le advierte de que no busque lo que no existe. O lo que existio pero ya no existe Brodeck comprende que no le conviene saber demasiado. Sin embargo la redaccion del informe lo obliga a interrogar y a interrogarse lo que a la postre puede suponer una amenaza para el y su familia. Considerado actualmente uno de los mejores novelistas franceses de su generacion Philippe Claudel renueva su exploracion de los recodos mas sombrios del ser humano y sus complejos mecanismos. Los escasos detalles sobre el lugar y el tiempo de la accion el pausado relato del narrador y su peculiar voz al limite de la ingenuidad otorgan a la novela la dimension de una parabola de enorme eficacia e intensidad a la vez sombria y llena de esperanza.,849838186X,9788498381863),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","If you want to learn about one of history’s most fascinating minds and uncover some of his secrets of imagination—secrets that enabled him to invent machines light years ahead of his time and literally bring light to the world—then you want to read this book.Imagination amplifies and colors every other element of genius, and unlocks our potential for understanding and ability. It’s no coincidence that geniuses not only dare to dream of the impossible for their work, but do the same for their lives. They’re audacious enough to think that they’re not just ordinary players. Few stories better illustrate this better than the life of the father of the modern world, a man of legendary imaginative power and wonder: Nikola Tesla.In this book, you’ll be taken on a whirlwind journey through Tesla’s life and work, and not only learn about the successes and mistakes of one of history’s greatest inventors, but also how to look at the world in a different, more imaginative way.Read this book now and learn lessons from Nikola Tesla on why imagination is so vital to awakening your inner genius, and insights into the real “secret” to creativity, as explained by people like Jobs, Picasso, Dali, and Twain.",B00CATSONE,B00CATSONE,Kindle Edition,,46 pages,"

","What made him lie to you?What caused him to notice her?What made him emotionally attached to her?The men in this novel are fictitious, but their behaviors and mannerisms are as tangible as the skin on your lips. Infallible is Infidelity from the perspective of men who perfected the art of grooming an additional lover, and their self-justification for her existence. Their names are embellished, but you know them, you've dated one of them: you didn't realize it until it was too late. These five adulterers will expound on the age-old question better than any magazine article or chat with a girlfriend over a pint of gelato. What makes a man cheat? Welcome to Infallible: VOL 2; where our cast of characters are faced with a life-changing decision to end their secondary relationships or continue as Man Whores. VOL 1 ended with a financial incentive from Uncle Glenn; VOL 2 picks up with the stipulation that they must dissolve the relationship with their mistresses within 72 hours. Can they do it? Will they do it? If you desire the truth about adultery in a glittered box tied with a pink ribbon, then INFALLIBLE is not for you. This novel is unapologetically raw and abrasive, because the discovery of an affair is equally raw and abrasive. Author TJ Spencer Jacques has gift-wrapped the ugly truth from a perspective that was never intended for female consumption. INFALLIBLE: VOL 2 is the whole truth conveniently packaged to provide insight and educate would-be victims. Welcome to Infallible - enter at the risk of your innocence.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,235 pages,"

Just a carefully cleared path up into the woods where generations of local children have processed with the solemn innocence of the young, taking with them their dear departed pets for burial.A sad place maybe, but safe.

","The daring, dazzling and highly anticipated follow-up to the New York Times bestseller The Song of AchillesOne of the Most Anticipated Books of 2018""An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner."" - Ann PatchettIn the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.",1549117645,9781549117640),Audiobook,Unabridged,12 pages,"

","Kevin Kwan, bestselling author ofCrazy Rich Asians, is back with a wickedly funny new novel of social climbing, secret e-mails, art-world scandal, lovesick billionaires, and the outrageous story of what happens when Rachel Chu, engaged to marry Asia's most eligible bachelor, discovers her birthfather. On the eve of her wedding to Nicholas Young, heir to one of the greatest fortunes in Asia, Rachel should be over the moon. She has a flawless Asscher-cut diamond from JAR, a wedding dress she loves more than anything found in the salons of Paris, and a fiance willing to sacrifice his entire inheritance in order to marry her.

","WHEN A MAN WAS REDUCED to asking advice of a tomcat, it didn’t bode well for the state of his affairs. And yet, here Brian Riordan was doing exactly that.   So begins this prequel to the Exit Unicorns series, as we join the Riordan boys in the rough and tumble world of Belfast, Northern Ireland, during a summer of change and promise. Casey Riordan is on the cusp on manhood, and is learning just how high the price of that transition can be. Tagging along on this adventure is his brother, Pat, who is both shadow and conscience to Casey. Their father, Brian, is simply trying to keep his sons safe—a tall order in the gritty streets of this particular city.   Bare Knuckle spans the events of one summer, giving a glimpse into the lives of the Riordans—the boys as they embark on the path to the men they are destined to be, and their father as he guides them along the way. The road is not smooth and contains hard lessons, both those of betrayal and treachery, all stemming from the events of one warm July night, when the match of hatred is set to the fuel of violence. After that night, life as they know it spirals out of control for the Riordans, until one man is forced to rejoin a world he thought he’d left behind forever, to ensure the safety of those he loves.

","A young mortician goes behind the scenes, unafraid of the gruesome (and fascinating) details of her curious profession.Most people want to avoid thinking about death, but Caitlin Doughty—a twenty-something with a degree in medieval history and a flair for the macabre—took a job at a crematory, turning morbid curiosity into her life’s work. Thrown into a profession of gallows humor and vivid characters (both living and very dead), Doughty learned to navigate the secretive culture of those who care for the deceased.Smoke Gets in Your Eyes tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters and unforgettable scenes. Caring for dead bodies of every color, shape, and affliction, Doughty soon becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the dead. She describes how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes) and reveals the strange history of cremation and undertaking, marveling at bizarre and wonderful funeral practices from different cultures.Her eye-opening, candid, and often hilarious story is like going on a journey with your bravest friend to the cemetery at midnight. She demystifies death, leading us behind the black curtain of her unique profession. And she answers questions you didn’t know you had: Can you catch a disease from a corpse? How many dead bodies can you fit in a Dodge van? What exactly does a flaming skull look like?Honest and heartfelt, self-deprecating and ironic, Doughty's engaging style makes this otherwise taboo topic both approachable and engrossing. Now a licensed mortician with an alternative funeral practice, Doughty argues that our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead).",9781490657585,9781490657585,Audiobook,,,"

Narcissus and Goldmund is his very best.

At its heart is one day in a Japanese slave labour camp in August 1943. As the day builds to its horrific climax, Dorrigo Evans battles and fails in his quest to save the lives of his fellow POWs, a man is killed for no reason, and a love story unfolds.",0385352859,9780385352857),Hardcover,,334 pages,"

","Комментарий экспертаНастоящий текст, известный также под названием «А Хули», является неумелой литературной подделкой, изготовленной неизвестным автором в первой четверти XXI века. Большинство экспертов согласны, что интересна не сама эта рукопись, а тот метод, которым она была заброшена в мир. Текстовый файл, озаглавленный «А Хули», якобы находился на хард-диске портативного компьютера, обнаруженного при «драматических обстоятельствах» в одном из московских парков. О срежиссированности этой акции свидетельствует милицейский протокол, в котором описана находка. Он, как нам представляется, дает неплохое представление о виртуозных технологиях современного пиара.Протокол подлинный, все печати и подписи на нем присутствуют, хотя неизвестно точное время его составления — верхняя часть заглавного листа с датой срезана при брошюровке и подшивке протокола в папку перед отправкой на хранение в конце календарного года, как требует служебная должностная инструкция. Из протокола следует, что интерес сотрудников милиции был вызван странными явлениями природы в Битцевском парке Южного административного округа города Москвы. Граждане наблюдали над деревьями голубоватое свечение, шаровые молнии и множество пятицветных радуг. Некоторые из радуг были шарообразными (по показаниям свидетелей происшествия, цвета в них как бы просвечивали друг сквозь друга).Эпицентром аномалии был обширный пустырь на границе парка, где расположен трамплин для прыжков на велосипеде. Рядом с трамплином обнаружены полурасплавленная рама от велосипеда «Canondale Jekyll 1000» и остатки колес. Трава в радиусе десяти метров вокруг трамплина выжжена, причем выгоревшее пятно имеет форму правильной пятиконечной звезды, за границами которой трава не пострадала. Рядом с велосипедной рамой найдены предметы женской одежды: джинсы, пара кроссовок, трусики типа «неделька» со словом «Воскресенье» и майка с вышитой на груди надписью «скиf».Если судить по фотографиям из протокола, третья буква этого слова больше похожа на кириллическое «И», чем на латинское «U». Можно предположить, что перед нами не анаграмма «fuck», как утверждает в своей монографии М. Лейбман, а слово «скиф». Это подтверждает строка «да, азиаты мы» на спине футболки — несомненная аллюзия на стихотворение А. Блока «Скифы», которого М. Лейбман, судя по всему, не читал.Среди предметов одежды находился рюкзак с портативным компьютером, о котором уже говорилось в протоколе. Все эти вещи не пострадали, и на них не обнаружено следов огня, что свидетельствует — они были подброшены на место происшествия уже после того, как на траве было выжжено звездообразное пятно. По факту данного события уголовного дела возбуждено не было.Судьба находившегося (якобы) на хард-диске текста хорошо известна — сначала он имел хождение в кругах оккультных маргиналов, а затем был издан в качестве книги. Оригинальное название текста показалось непристойным даже нынешним барышникам от книготорговли, поэтому при издании он был переименован в «Священную Книгу Оборотня».Этот текст не заслуживает, конечно, серьезного литературоведческого или критического анализа. Тем не менее, отметим, что в нем просматривается настолько густая сеть заимствований, подражаний, перепевов и аллюзий (не говоря уже о дурном языке и редкостном инфантилизме автора), что вопроса о его аутентичности или подлинности перед серьезным специалистом по литературе не стоит, и интересен он исключительно как симптом глубокого духовного упадка, переживаемого нашим обществом. А псевдовосточная поп-метафизика, шапочным знакомством с которой автору не терпится похвалиться перед такими же унылыми неудачниками, способна вызвать у серьезных и состоявшихся в жизни людей разве что сострадательную улыбку. Хочется уверить москвичей и гостей столицы, что чистота и порядок в Битцевском парке поддерживаются на должном уровне и московская милиция днем и ночью охраняет покой и безопасность прогуливающихся. А самое главное, друзья — чтобы в вашей жизни всегда нашлось место радостной песне!Тенгиз Кокоев, майор, начальник О/M «Битца-центр»Майя Марачарская, Игорь Кошкодавленко, кандидат филологических наукПелдис Шарм, ведущий телепрограммы «Караоке о Главном»",837414212,837414212,Paperback,,352 pages,"

Até agora ninguém o superou em audácia e imaginação.""Henry MillerEmbora tenha parado de escrever aos 21 anos, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891) foi uma das vozes poéticas mais talentosas já vistas, e sua pequena obra influenciou os maiores escritores dos séculos XIX e XX. Uma temporada no inferno, de 1873 – aqui em edição bilíngüe –, é o visceral relato em prosa poética do homem perscrutando as suas profundezas e origens. De uma riqueza imagética sem precedentes na literatura, os textos deste livro visitam sonhos e terras distantes, desejo de solidão e sede de conhecimento, o passado ancestral e a busca pelo desconhecido. Deles emerge o homem rebelde e aventureiro, vivendo – como dizia Verlaine a respeito de Rimbaud – a própria “vida inimitável”.",8525406716,9788525406712),Paperback,edição bilíngue,104 pages,"

Leda’s quest to gain the magic she needs to save her brother leads her to the castle of the Dragons, home of four soldiers in the Legion of Angels with extraordinary powers over the elements. If she makes it through their training, she might just survive her next sip of the gods’ Nectar and level up her magic.  But the gods’ gifts of magic come at a price. Leda can already feel the Nectar changing her, making her less human—and so is her budding romance with the angel Nero. Sip by sip, kiss by kiss, the change is taking hold of her.  As if that’s not enough, Leda finds herself once again caught between the armies of heaven and hell—and tempted by a darkness that threatens to consume the Earth.

","In a remote Polish village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology, translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over humans. Then a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon other bodies are discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit. If only anyone would pay her mind...A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale,  Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead  is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity and madness, justice and tradition, autonomy and fate. Whom do we deem sane? it asks. Who is worthy of a voice?",0525541330,9780525541332),Hardcover,,274 pages,"

","In this warm, stimulating brew of personal stories, acclaimed author Kathleen Dean Moore uses the metaphor of an island to challenge the cynicism inherent in the Western worldview. A gifted storyteller with a sly sense of humor, Moore explores three separations brought to us by Enlightenment philosophers: the separation of human from nature, of things near and far away, and of the sacred from the mundane. Challenging each, such as Descartes' idea that humans have a discrete consciousness and can alter creation while remaining unaltered themselves, she reveals why such divisions don't tally with the values expressed daily in the way people live. Moore disguises her philosophical explorations in stories: about vacationing on a tiny island in Alaska, visiting her father in the hospital, watching grouse perform their mating dance in the desert. Throughout, she shows that, when properly observed, the world is full of opportunities to find hidden connections.",1571312765,9781571312761),Hardcover,,247 pages,"

","Quando naquela manhã chuvosa de Dezembro de 1905, Luís Bernardo é chamado por El-Rei D. Carlos a Vila Viçosa, não imaginava o que o futuro lhe reservava. Não sabia que teria de trocar a sua vida despreocupada na sociedade cosmopolita de Lisboa por uma missão tão patriótica quanto arriscada na distante ilha de S. Tomé. Não esperava que o cargo de governador e a defesa da dignidade dos trabalhadores das roças o lançassem numa rede de conflitos e interesses com a metrópole. E não contava que a descoberta do amor lhe viesse mudar a vida.Equador é um retrato brilhante da sociedade portuguesa nos últimos dias da Monarquia, que traça um paralelo entre os serões mundanos da capital e o ambiente duro e retrógrado das colónias.É com esta história admirável, comovente e perturbadora, que Miguel Sousa Tavares inaugura a sua incursão no romance.",9789895550135,9789895550135,Paperback,Large Print,528 pages,"

My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:

1. I’m in a coma.

2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.

3. Sometimes I lie.
Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?",0008225354,9780008225353),Paperback,,387 pages,"

","La quête d'absolu s'accorde mal aux convenances hypocrites en vigueur dans la haute société pétersbourgeoise de cette fin du XIXe siècle. Anna Karénine en fera la douloureuse expérience. Elle qui ne sait ni mentir ni tricher - l'antithèse d'une Bovary - ne peut ressentir qu'un profond mépris pour ceux qui condamnent au nom de la morale sa passion adultère. Et en premier lieu son mari, l'incarnation parfaite du monde auquel il appartient, lui plus soucieux des apparences que véritablement peiné par la trahison d'Anna. Le drame de cette femme intelligente, sensible et séduisante n'est pas d'avoir succombé à la passion dévorante que lui inspire le comte Vronski, mais de lui avoir tout sacrifié, elle, sa vie de femme, sa vie de mère. Vronski, finalement lassé, retrouvera les plaisirs de la vie mondaine. Dans son insondable solitude, Anna, qui ne peut paraître à ses côtés, aura pour seule arme l'humiliante jalousie pour faire vivre les derniers souffles d'un amour en perdition. Mais sa quête est vaine, c'est une ""femme perdue"". --Lenaïc Gravis et Jocelyn Blériot",207039252X,9782070392520),Mass Market Paperback,,858 pages,"

There, overcome with memories of the man she adored and consumed by a history she never knew, she is pulled into another time.The Ireland of 1921, teetering on the edge of war, is a dangerous place in which to awaken. But there Anne finds herself, hurt, disoriented, and under the care of Dr. Thomas Smith, guardian to a young boy who is oddly familiar.

","Fantagraphics is proud to re-present Krazy Kat to a new generation of readers. Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect ""her"" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E. Cummings to recognize Herriman's genius almost immediately. Each of Fantagraphics' Krazy Ignatz volumes is designed by Chris Ware, creator of the wildly successful ACME Novelty Library series. This beautiful volume includes material never collected before.",1560973862,9781560973867),Paperback,,120 pages,"

","Η δίκη του μεγάλου φιλοσόφου και η απολογία του στο δικαστήριο, με την οποία φτάνει στην απόλυτη συνέπεια λόγων και πράξεων. Η κατηγορία εις βάρος του και η αντιμετώπισή της.Ο Πλάτων γεννήθηκε το 427 π.Χ., γόνος επιφανούς Αθηναϊκής οικογένειας. Έλαβε σπουδαία παιδεία και γνώρισε τα Ελληνικά φιλοσοφικά ρεύματα. Αυτό όμως που διαμόρφωσε καθοριστικά την ηθική και πνευματική του υπόσταση ήταν ο Σωκράτης, με τη ζωή, τη φιλοσοφία και τον θάνατό του. Ο μεγάλος φιλόσοφος ήταν αιτία να στραφεί ο νεαρός Πλάτων στη φιλοσοφία, και η Σωκρατική εννοιολογία αποτέλεσε βάση για τη δημιουργία της κατοπινής Πλατωνικής θεωρίας των Ιδεών. Ο Πλάτων ερμήνευσε βαθύτατα τον Σωκράτη ως άνθρωπο και διδάσκαλο, και αποτύπωσε την προσωπικότητά του σε πολλά έργα του. Ταξίδεψε στην Αίγυπτο, την Κυρήνη και τη Μεγάλη Ελλάδα, όπου προσπάθησε, χωρίς επιτυχία να εφαρμόσει τις πολιτικές αρχές του στην οργάνωση των Ελληνικών πόλεων της Σικελίας. Το 387 π.Χ. ίδρυσε στην Αθήνα την Ακαδημία, περίφημο κέντρο της φιλοσοφίας και των Μουσών, που διατηρήθηκε σχεδόν δέκα αιώνες, μέχρι τους χρόνους του Ιουστινιανού. Ο Πλάτων αφοσιώθηκε ως το θάνατό του (348 π.Χ) στη διδασκαλία και τη συγγραφή. Τα έργα του, που σώζονται όλα, ταξινόμησε ο Θράσυλλος σε εννέα τετραλογίες. Όλα σχεδόν ανήκουν στο είδος του διαλόγου, με το οποίο ο Πλάτων αναδείχτηκε, εκτός από κορυφαίος φιλόσοφος, αληθινός ποιητής. Η διδασκαλία του πηγάζει από τα δόγματα της Ελληνικής σκέψης, τον Ορφισμό, την Πυθαγόρεια και την Ιωνική φιλοσοφία και βέβαια τον Σωκρατικό λόγο, και διαμορφώνεται τελικά, ως προσωπική δημιουργία του Πλάτωνος, σε ένα κολοσσιαίο φιλοσοφικό σύστημα. Η φιλοσοφία του - ηθική, οντολογική, πολιτική - είναι το θεμέλιο του παγκόσμιου Ιδεαλισμού και επηρέασε περισσότερο ίσως απ' οποιονδήποτε άλλο τη σκέψη όλων των εποχών.",9603520276,9789603520276),Paperback,,123 pages,"

In the past ten years, this thirty-something has buried four of them, collateral damage in his quest for love. Now he’s heading west to Los Angeles, the city of second chances, determined to put his past behind him.In Hollywood, Joe blends in effortlessly with the other young upstarts. He eats guac, works in a bookstore, and flirts with a journalist neighbor. But while others seem fixated on their own reflections, Joe can’t stop looking over his shoulder. The problem with hidden bodies is that they don’t always stay that way. They re-emerge, like dark thoughts, multiplying and threatening to destroy what Joe wants most: true love. And when he finds it in a darkened room in Soho House, he’s more desperate than ever to keep his secrets buried. He doesn’t want to hurt his new girlfriend—he wants to be with her forever.

","What price perfection?David is an American investment banker living in London; Elizabeth, his wife, is a woman of peerless beauty and refinement. They have two children; their marriage seems perfect. Why does she want him to retire and move home to America? One summer evening, David, alone in their empty mansion, receives a phone call from a long-lost friend. So begins a tale about friendship, marriage, and betrayal that is filled with unexpected reversals.Canarino is a portrait of intimate relationships set in a world of privilege and achievement. Its characters possess personal gifts in dazzling abundance, yet their appetites to succeed, to be exceptional, tempt them to risk everything. What is the cost for the heart of seeking perfection?In Katherine Bucknell’s first novel, beauty and passion are stalked by desolation. Like the drink of the title—boiling water over a twist of lemon peel—the prose has a sharp, delicate clarity. Beneath its polished surface lie psychological depths both uncanny and haunting. Canarino is a novel that lingers in the mind, a remarkable debut.",B00GCBJWDW,B00GCBJWDW,Kindle Edition,,352 pages,"

She also happens to be the U.S. Marshals’ best bet to keep a family alive. . . .The marshals are looking for the perfect girl to join a mother, father, and son on the run from the nation’s most notorious criminals. After all, the bad guys are searching for a family with one kid, not two, and adding a streetwise girl who knows a little something about hiding things may be just what the marshals need.Nicki swears she can keep the Trevor family safe, but to do so she’ll have to dodge hitmen, cyberbullies, and the specter of standardized testing, all while maintaining her marshal-mandated B-minus average.

","Lost in love and don't know much? Paul Feig knew even less...Like any other red-blooded, straight young man, Paul Feig spent much of his teenage years trying to solve the mystery of women. Unlike most red-blooded, straight teenage boys, however, Paul Feig was sadly at a considerable disadvantage. He was tall and gangly. He had a love for musical theater. And, perhaps the death knell for his burgeoning sex life, Paul was a tap dance student. (And we have the pictures to prove it—see the front cover.)Infused with the same witty and infectiously readable style of his first book, Kick Me, Superstud chronicles the trials and tribulations of Feig’s young dating life with all the same excruciating detail as an on-air gastric bypass—and you just won’t be able to tear yourself away. Feig’s series of shudder-to-think but oddly familiar (come on—we’ve all been dumped by someone we didn’t even like that much) anecdotes include: his first date, at an REO Speedwagon concert with the most endowed girl in school, who leaves him sitting next to a puddle of puke; his first breakup, accomplished by moving across the country; his mortifying date with his secretly bigoted girlfriend; his discovery of a new self-love technique that almost lands him in the hospital; and his less-than-idealistic “first time,” which he nevertheless elevates to biblical proportions. In Superstud, Paul Feig tells all in a hilarious but true testament to geekdom, love, and growing up.",1400051754,9781400051755),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","First published in 1945, ""In Youth Is Pleasure"" is a beautiful and unassuming coming-of-age novel by the English writer and painter Denton Welch (1915-1948). Painfully sensitive and sad Orville Pym is 15 years old, and this novel recounts the summer holiday after his first miserable year at public school--but as in all of Welch's work, what is most important are the details of his characters' surroundings. Welch is a Proustian writer of uncanny powers of observation who, as William S. Burroughs wrote, ""makes the reader aware of the magic that is right under his eyes."" Film director John Waters includes this novel as one of his ""Five Books You Should Read to Live a Happy Life If Something Is Basically the Matter with You,"" and writes: ""Maybe there is no better novel in the world than Denton Welch's ""In Youth Is Pleasure."" Just holding it in my hands, so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger."" Also included in this edition is the first U.S. publication of ""I Left My Grandfather's House."" This first-person account of an idyllic walking tour in the British countryside undertaken when Welch was 18 makes a fascinating companion piece to the fictionalized, though no less autobiographical, ""In Youth Is Pleasure.""",1878972138,9781878972132),Paperback,,272 pages,"

Self-sacrifice, Oriental mysticism, racial ""truth,"" the public good, doing one's duty--these are among the seductive catch-phrases that Leonard Peikoff dissects, examining the kind of philosophy they symbolize, the type of thinking that lured Germany to its doom and that he says is now prevalent in the United States.

","Al igual que otras ficciones de Tolstói, esta historia surge de unos hechos reales que le fueron relatados oralmente. Si bien el propio autor no conoció en persona a Hadji Murat, personaje célebre en la guerra del Cáucaso, si que conoció a quienes le conocieron y, tal y como trasluce en sus páginas, Tolstói guarda hacia él una viva simpatía. A lo largo de varios años se documentó exhaustivamente acerca de las gentes y las costumbres de la región, habló con otras personas que participaron en el conflicto y confrontó esas fuentes con su propia experiencia, vivida en esa región entre los años 1851 y 1853, así como su propio conocimiento del alma humana. El relato confronta la visión de la vida sencilla y tradicional de los campesinos cosacos con la de la tumultuosa y variante de los soldados rusos, desplazados a la zona para asimilar una región que sobrevive a pesar del invasor.Esta obra tardía fue publicada tras la muerte del autor. Puede leerse como un auténtico estudio etnológico y sociológico por su carácter costumbrista en la exposición de la vida de los campesinos. Pero hay en ella un inequivoco sesgo político y social y una denuncia del despotismo.",8437614988,9788437614984),Paperback,,206 pages,"

","Washed-up Hollywood producer Charlie Berns has mailed in his updated obit and is about to suck his Mercedes tailpipe and fade to black when a miracle materializes: his nephew, a wannabe screenwriter from New Jersey, has scripted the life story of Queen Victoria's prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, which Charlie manages to turn into a hot property that reinstates him as a player. But as the deal heats up, a few conceptual changes morph the project into Lev Disraeli: Freedom Fighter, an action thriller with a black Jewish superstar, a Yugoslavian location, a mad Polish director, and even a real-life kidnapping. Is Charlie Berns being eaten alive by the system? Or is he giving the Hollywood hotshots a run for their money? Peter Lefcourt's hilarious satire proves the old adage that in Hollywood you're never quite as dead as people give you credit for.",0743456440,9780743456449),Paperback,,307 pages,"

","In a difficult, uncertain time, it takes a person of great courage, such as the Dalai Lama, to give us hope. Regardless of the violence and cynicism we see on television and read about in the news, there is an argument to be made for basic human goodness. The number of people who spend their lives engaged in violence and dishonesty is tiny compared to the vast majority who would wish others only well. According to the Dalai Lama, our survival has depended and will continue to depend on our basic goodness. Ethics for the New Millennium presents a moral system based on universal rather than religious principles. Its ultimate goal is happiness for every individual, irrespective of religious beliefs. Though he himself a practicing Buddhist, the Dalai Lama's teachings and the moral compass that guides him can lead each and every one of us—Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, or atheist—to a happier, more fulfilling life.His Holiness the Dalai Lama's newest book, The Wisdom of Compassion, is now available from Riverhead Books.",1573228834,9781573228831),Paperback,,237 pages,"

Combining two of the beloved folk historian's nostalgic how-to guides, this collection offers vintage, homespun advice that recalls ""the joy of doing things not just the old-fashioned way, but plainly the right way.""A shining historical gem, this little book of American lore recalls a more kindly, less hurried time. Lovingly gathered by ""Mr. Americana"" himself from colonial-era almanacs and diaries, hundreds of brief reflections spread time-honored wisdom on everything from curing hiccups, lighting a proper fire, and mending clothing and furniture, to predicting the weather, making soap, and getting rid of ants, bees, swallows — and boring houseguests. Sloane's evocative drawings add the perfect finishing touch.",0486455947,9780486455945),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

","I stood at the window watching the cocoon, which hung in the winter air like an upside–down question mark. That was the moment... I understood. Really understood. Crisis, change, all the myriad upheavals that blister the spirit and leave us groping– they aren't voices simply of pain but also of creativity. And if we would only listen, we might hear such times beckoning us to a season of waiting, to the place of fertile emptiness.Blending her own experiences with an intimate grasp of contemplative spirituality, Sue Monk Kidd relates the passionate and moving tale of her spiritual crisis at midlife, when life seemed to have lost meaning and how her longing for hasty escape from the pain yielded to a discipline of ""active waiting."" Comparing her experience to the formative processes inside a chrysalis on a wintry tree branch, Kidd reflects on the fact that the soul is often symbolized as a butterfly. The simple cocoon, a living parable of waiting, becomes an icon of hope for the transformation that the author sought. Kidd charts her re–ascent from the depths and offers a new understanding of the passage away from the self, which is based upon others' expectations, to the true self of God's unfolding intention. Her wise, inspiring book helps those in doubt and crisis recognize the opportunity to ""dismantle old masks and patterns and unfold a deeper, more authentic self.""",0061144894,9780061144899),Paperback,,240 pages,"

Widely praised and much-discussed, this classic book explores how cooperation can emerge in a world of self-seeking egoists—whether superpowers, businesses, or individuals—when there is no central authority to police their actions. The problem of cooperation is central to many different fields. Robert Axelrod recounts the famous computer tournaments in which the “cooperative” program Tit for Tat recorded its stunning victories, explains its application to a broad spectrum of subjects, and suggests how readers can both apply cooperative principles to their own lives and teach cooperative principles to others.",0465005640,9780465005642),Paperback,Revised Edition,264 pages,"

Lame Deer
  Storyteller, rebel, medicine man, Lame Deer was born almost a century ago on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. A full-blooded Sioux, he was many things in the white man's world -- rodeo clown, painter, prisioner. But, above all, he was a holy man of the Lakota tribe.  Seeker of Vision  The story he tells is one of harsh youth and reckless manhood, shotgun marriage and divorce, history and folklore as rich today as ever -- and of his fierce struggle to keep pride alive, though living as a stranger in his own ancestral land.",0671888021,9780671888022),Paperback,Enriched Classic,352 pages,"

In the new world order, Farnham and his family, being members of the race that had nearly destroyed the world, were fit only to be slaves.

","In this stunning follow-up to his epic fantasy debut, Alan Campbell propels readers into a captivating city battling for its own survival—and that of humankind—in a world of deities and demons, fallen angels and killers.


After a destructive battle, the ancient swaying city of Deepgate has been overtaken. Most of the chains that suspend it have given way, toxic fumes are emanating from blazing structures, and the temple once inhabited by the ruling Presbyter now dangles upside down above the once-uncharted abyss. The victorious Spine have initiated martial law and are ruthlessly pursuing all who attempt to leave. Amid the turmoil, two captives are returned. Arriving by ship are the young angel Dill, now toughened by war, and traitor assassin Rachel Hael. Incarcerated in the slowly crumbling temple, the two await their fate, while from the abyss beneath them ghosts rise—for the death of the god Ulcis has left open the gates to Hell.But on orders from his divine brethren, Cospinol, the god of brine and fog, is traveling the world to Deepgate to seal this breach. His great skyship is being dragged through the air by the giant John Anchor, a monster of a man enslaved to pull the god’s vessel, moving slowly, inevitably, toward the city.As the city waits, teetering on the brink, myriad plans for vengeance are set in motion, from the continent of Pandemeria to Heaven itself. Among them is a ghostly archon sent to deliver a message to the gods on earth—using Dill as his vessel. Thrust from his body, Dill’s own soul returns to Hell. When Dill and Rachel are attacked by Spine assassins, Rachel has no choice but to try to escape with the creature that calls itself Dill…and to somehow find a way to restore her friend’s soul before it’s too late. For powerful forces are stirring, and in the coming battle between gods, it is the world of men that is at stake.From the Hardcover edition.",0553384171,9780553384178),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

Drechsler pulls no punches in her depiction of incest, and many scenes are hard to read, but this book shows that comics can be a vehicle for serious subjects; the drawings pull the reader into her world more completely than the written word ever could. Drechsler's depiction of childhood is perfect, and there are happy moments within the horror of Lily's life. In one chapter, Lily and a friend contemplate suicide, then walk into the woods, away from their problems.

","When it comes to reporting on politics, nobody does it smarter or funnier than bestselling author Molly Ivins. In Shrub, Ivins focuses her Texas-size smarts on the biggest politician in her home state: George Walker Bush, or ""Shrub,"" as Ivins has nicknamed Bush the Younger.         A candidate of vague speeches and an ambiguous platform, Bush leads the pack of GOP 2000 presidential hopefuls; ""Dubya"" could very well be our next president. What voters need now is an original, smart, and accessible analysis of Bush--one that leaves the ""youthful indiscretions"" to the tabloids and gets to the heart of his policies and motivations. Ivins is the perfect woman for the job.         With her trademark wit and down-home wisdom, Molly Ivins shares three pieces of advice on judging a politician: ""The first is to look at the record. The second is to look at the record. And third, look at the record."" In this book, Ivins takes a good, hard look at the record of the man who could be the leader of the free world. Beginning with his post-college military career, Ivins tracks Dubya's winding, sometimes unlikely path from a failed congressional bid to a two-term governorship. Bush has made plenty of friends and supporters along the way, including Texas oil barons, evangelist Billy Graham, and co-investors in the Texas Rangers baseball team. ""You would have to work at it to dislike the man,"" she writes. But for all of Bush's likeability, Ivins points to a disconcerting lack of political passion from this ascending presidential candidate. In her words, ""If you think his daddy had trouble with 'the vision thing,' wait till you meet this one.""         Witty, trenchant, and on target, Ivins gives a singularly perceptive and entertaining analysis of George W. Bush. To head to the voting booth without it would be downright un-American.From Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush""        The past is prologue in politics. If a politician is left, right, weak, strong, given to the waffle or the flip-flop, or, as sometimes happens, an able soul who performs well under pressure, all that will be in the record."" ¸         Bush's welfare record: ""Texas pols like to 'git tuff' on crime, welfare, commies, and other bad stuff. Bush proposed to git tuff on welfare recipients by ending the allowance for each additional child--which in Texas is $38 a month."" ¸         Bush and the Christian right: ""Bush has learned to dance with the Christian right. It has been interesting and amusing to watch the process. Interesting because it's sometimes hard to tell who's leading and who's following; amusing because when a scion of Old Yankee money gets together with a televangelist with too much Elvis, the result is swell entertainment."" ¸         Bush's environmental record: Since Governor Bush's election, Texas air quality has been rated the worst in the nation, leading all fifty states in overall toxic releases, recognized carcinogens in the air, cancer risk, and ten other categories of pollutants. ¸         Bush's military career: ""Bush was promoted as the Texas Air National Guard's anti-drug poster boy, one of life's little ironies given the difficulty he has had answering cocaine questions all these years later. 'George Walker Bush is one member of the younger generation who doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or speed,' reads a Guard press release of 1970. 'Oh, he gets high, all right, but not from narcotics.'""From the Hardcover edition.",0375757147,9780375757143),Paperback,,193 pages,"

","In this debut work by New York Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (The New York Trilogy), The Invention of Solitude, a memoir, established Auster’s reputation as a major new voice in American writing. His moving and personal meditation on fatherhood is split into two stylistically separate sections. In the first, Auster reflects on the memories of his father who was a distant, undemonstrative, and cold man who died an untimely death. As he sifts through his Father’s things, Auster uncovers a sixty-year-old murder mystery that sheds light on his father’s elusive character. In the second section, the perspective shifts and Auster begins to reflect on his own identity as a father by adopting the voice of a narrator, “A.” Through a mosaic of images, coincidences, and associations “A,” contemplates his separation from his son, his dying grandfather, turning the story into a self-conscious reflection on the process of writing.",0143112228,9780143112228),Paperback,,192 pages,"

Her life in rural Tennessee was filled with family, friends, school, cheerleading, and the daily tasks of living on a farm. And then came a little show called ""Hannah Montana."" Almost overnight, Miley would rocket to superstardom, becoming a television and singing phenomenon. Quiet days were replaced with sold-out concerts, television appearances, and magazine shoots. But through it all, Miley has remained close to her family and friends and has stayed connected to the Southern roots that made her so strong. In Miles to Go, Miley offers an honest, humorous, and often touching story of one girl's coming-of-age--from private moments with her pappy to off-roading with her dad, Billy Ray, to her run-ins with mean girls. Miley talks about suffering through drama and heartbreak and coming out the other end unscathed (relatively). And now for the first time, she will discuss it all-the milestones still left to reach (driver's license! voting!), dreams to live out (travel to Asia! find true love!), and the lessons to be learned (remembernig to enjoy every moment!).

","El Horla y otros cuentos fantásticos agrupa dieciocho relatos de Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893) cuyos ingredientes son el misterio, la locura, los crímenes de oscuro origen, el suicidio, el miedo y la soledad. En ellos, el elemento fantástico no constituye una brutal intrusión en la normalidad, sino que se acompasa, de forma mucho más insidiosa, con la vida cotidiana; es lo incognoscible que ronda en torno al hombre, pero también el reflejo de los fantasmas que habitan su cerebro. En el prólogo que precede a la recopilación, Esther Benítez, traductora del volumen, explica sus criterios de selección y sitúa los relatos en el contexto de la obra y la personalidad de Maupassant.",2011665833,9782011665836),Paperback,,120 pages,"

Here is the master of American vernacular--the rhythms of jazz and gospel and ordinary speech--at the height of his powers, telling a powerful, evocative tale of a prodigal of the twentieth century.""Tell me what happened while there's still time,"" demands the dying Senator Adam Sunraider to the itinerate Negro preacher whom he calls Daddy Hickman. As a young man, Sunraider was Bliss, an orphan taken in by Hickman and raised to be a preacher like himself. Bliss's history encompasses the joys of young southern boyhood; bucolic days as a filmmaker, lovemaking in a field in the Oklahoma sun. And behind it all lies a mystery: how did this chosen child become the man who would deny everything to achieve his goals?

I have, in my secret heart, long dreamt of an intimate connection with a man; every Jane, I believe, deserves her Rochester.""Though poor, plain, and unconnected, Charlotte Bronte possesses a deeply passionate side which she reveals only in her writings—creating Jane Eyre and other novels that stand among literature's most beloved works. Living a secluded life in the wilds of Yorkshire with her sisters Emily and Anne, their drug-addicted brother, and an eccentric father who is going blind, Charlotte Bronte dreams of a real love story as fiery as the ones she creates.But it is in the pages of her diary where Charlotte exposes her deepest feelings and desires—and the truth about her life, its triumphs and shattering disappointments, her family, the inspiration behind her work, her scandalous secret passion for the man she can never have . . . and her intense, dramatic relationship with the man she comes to love, the enigmatic Arthur Bell Nicholls.""Who is this man who has dared to ask for my hand? Why is my father so dead set against him? Why are half the residents of Haworth determined to lynch him—or shoot him?""From Syrie James, the acclaimed, bestselling author of The Lost Memoirs of Jane Austen, comes a powerfully compelling, intensely researched literary feat that blends historical fact and fiction to explore the passionate heart and unquiet soul of Charlotte Bronte.

","On 7 August 1889, an American woman, Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, was sentenced to death in a court in Liverpool, England, for a crime she did not commit. She was condemned for the murder of her husband. Her husband was Jack the Ripper.This book reveals how the largest and most detailed investigation ever undertaken on the subject of the Ripper Murders led the author to the story of Florence and how she was framed for the murder of her husband, James Maybrick, as part of an official cover which continues to this day.The key to this extraordinary story is the Diary Of Jack the Ripper. When this remarkable documents first came to light, Paul H. Feldman set out to prove that it was a hoax. He couldn't. In fact, the more he researched the Diary, the more he became convinced that it was genuine, that it was written by James Maybrick and that Maybrick was the Ripper. Now he has proved it.Feldman explains exactly why the Ripper murders always been shrouded in secrecy, why there was an official cover-up, why there have always been rumors of links to the British Royal Family, why there has always been speculation about Masonic involvement and why an innocent American was sentenced to death for a crime that she did not commit.As well as providing the long-awaited solution to one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of crime, this is a story about real people.

","THE LADY: Beth Ridgeway was a violet-eyed platinum beauty -- the kind of woman who made men burn with desire. Yet her husband Nathan didn't want her... THE ROGUE: Rafael Santana, the darkly handsome and arrogant son of a wealthy Texas family, had been kidnapped by the Comanches and raised as a warrior. Even now, all his gentleman's breeding couldn't conceal the savage strength beneath his aristocraic bearing. THE FURY: Beth thought he was cruel and insensitive, a man who used women only for his selfish pleasure and then tossed them away. Rafael thought she was a common wench -- flirtatious and unfaithful -- who took pride in breaking men's hearts. THE FIRE: Yet something had happened when their eyes first met at a dazzling New Orleans ball. Something their hearts could not deny, something neither the years nor the violent misunderstandings could diminish. Because for the first time, both Beth and Rafael were awakening to the magnificent passions of love.",0380822970,9780380822973),Paperback,,486 pages,"

","""No work in modern literature, with the possible exception of Uncle Tom's Cabin, can compete with What Is to Be Done? in its effect on human lives and its power to make history. For Chernyshevsky's novel, far more than Marx's Capital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution.""--Joseph Frank, The Southern ReviewAlmost from the moment of its publication in 1863, Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done?, had a profound impact on the course of Russian literature and politics. The idealized image it offered of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals transforming society by means of scientific knowledge served as a model of inspiration for Russia's revolutionary intelligentsia. On the one hand, the novel's condemnation of moderate reform helped to bring about the irrevocable break between radical intellectuals and liberal reformers; on the other, Chernyshevsky's socialist vision polarized conservatives' opposition to institutional reform. Lenin himself called Chernyshevsky ""the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx""; and the controversy surrounding What Is to Be Done? exacerbated the conflicts that eventually led to the Russian Revolution.Michael R. Katz's readable and compelling translation is now the definitive unabridged English-language version, brilliantly capturing the extraordinary qualities of the original. William G. Wagner has provided full annotations to Chernyshevsky's allusions and references and to the, sources of his ideas, and has appended a critical bibliography. An introduction by Katz and Wagner places the novel in the context of nineteenth-century Russian social, political, and intellectual history and literature, and explores its importance for several generations of Russian radicals.",0801495474,9780801495472),Paperback,,445 pages,"

","At fifteen, Natalie Ward believes her life is perfect. Growing up on a dairy farm in the mountains of British Columbia less than two miles from the American border, she knows little of the outside world. But she knows family. A family so close and loving that they are the envy of the nearby town of Atwood. Friends and neighbors, young and old alike, show up regularly on their farmhouse porch–all willing to share in the never-ending daily chores in exchange for a place at the Ward family table. Natalie cherishes her position as the only daughter of the beautiful Nettie Ward–the pride of the Catholic Ladies Auxiliary–and the town's milkman, Gus Ward–the darling of Atwood housewives. She adores her three brothers, especially the eldest, Boyer, whom she idolizes with a childlike worship. Like her mother, Natalie believes their lives are blessed, as rich and as sweet as the fresh milk that is their livelihood. Everything changes one hot July afternoon in 1966 when a long-haired stranger walks up the winding dirt road to their door. The arrival of this soft-spoken American, a Vietnam War resister, will test the morals and beliefs of the Ward family and their close-knit community. The catastrophic events that are set in motion will leave relationships shattered and Natalie separated from the family she loves in ways that she could never have imagined. Thirty-five years later, Natalie receives a late-night phone call from her now-estranged brother Boyer. Their mother is dying. Torn between the love of her mother and the fear of the past, Natalie returns to the town she has spent her entire adult life avoiding. As she travels back to her childhood home she steels herself against the bittersweet memories of that summer day in 1966 and the tragedy that followed. But before Natalie can find redemption, she must confront the secrets and horrors of a past she has desperately tried to forget.",1554681669,9780061462993),,,311 pages,"

","""These notes are about the process of design: the process of inventing things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to function."" This book, opening with these words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of design.In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities.In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct.The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village.",0674627512,9780674627512),Paperback,,224 pages,"

(D&C 88:63.) In To Draw Closer to God, Elder Henry B. Eyring explains some of the ways we can claim these promises. In his thoughtful, spiritual style, he discusses such topics as learning to hear the Lord's voice, choosing to be good, overcoming trials of faith, strengthening the family, surrendering to Christ, and helping others draw closer to the Lord. Elder Eyring writes, ""Yield your heart unto God. Ask him what it is he would have you do. Know that he will have prepared a way for you to do it, even under great difficulties. Ask him how he would have you share what you have with others, and you will feel his love. He lives and he loves you. He wants you to come home again.""

","What happens to a child when her own parents reject her and sit idly by as others abuse her? In this poignant, heart wrenching debut work, Regina Louise recounts her childhood search for someone to feel connected to. A mother she has never known--but long fantasized about-- deposited her and her half sister at the same group home that she herself fled years before. When another resident beats Regina so badly that she can barely move, she knows that she must leave this terrible place-the only home she knows. Thus begins Regina's fight to survive, utterly alone at the age of 10. A stint living with her mother and her abusive boyfriend is followed by a stay with her father's lily white wife and daughters, who ignore her before turning to abuse and ultimately kicking her out of the house. Regina then tries everything in her search for someone to care for her and to care about, from taking herself to jail to escaping countless foster homes to be near her beloved counselor. Written in her distinctive and unique voice, Regina's story offers an in-depth look at the life of a child who no one wanted. From her initial flight to her eventual discovery of love, your heart will go out to Regina's younger self, and you'll cheer her on as she struggles to be Somebody's Someone.",0446529109,9780446529105),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

The secrets of the dead are in her hands.
  The bones of three young women are unearthed in the basement of a Montreal pizza parlor, and forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan has unsolved murder on her mind as she examines the shallowly buried remains. Coming up against a homicide cop who is convinced the dead have been entombed on the site for centuries, Tempe perseveres, even with her own relationship with Detective Andrew Ryan at a delicate turning point. In the lab, the clean, well-perserved bones offer few clues. But when Carbon 14 confirms her hunch that these were recent deaths despite the antique buttons found near the bodies, Tempe's probing must produce answers quickly to stop a killer whose grisly handiwork has seen the light of day.",0743453018,9780743453011),Paperback,,383 pages,"

Whether you are opening Free to Be . . . You and Me for the first time or the one hundredth time you will be engaged and transformed by this newly beautifully illustrated compilation of inspirational stories, songs, and poems. The sentiments of thirty-five years ago are as relevant today as when this book was published. Celebrating individuality and challenging stereotypes empowers both children and adults with the freedom to be who they want to be and to have compassion and empathy for others who may be different. Working closely with Marlo and co-creator Carole Hart, Peter H. Reynolds, the New York Times Best Selling Children's Book Author/Illustrator, conjured his whimsical drawings throughout the book bringing a new sense of unity and warmth to the pages. You will find yourself marveling at the illustrations, nodding in agreement with the stories and poems, and singing the words to all the classic songs! It is wonderful that the thoughts, ideas, and emotions the creators envisioned so many years ago can still have a magical effect on children today.",0762413069,9780762413065),Paperback,,144 pages,"

","When lives are dominated by hunger, what becomes of love? When assaulted by daily acts of violence and untimely death, what happens to trust? Set in the lands of Northeast Brazil, this is an account of the everyday experience of scarcity, sickness and death that centres on the lives of the women and children of a hillside ""favela"". Bringing her readers to the impoverished slopes above the modern plantation town of Bom Jesus de Mata, where she has worked on and off for 25 years, Nancy Scheper-Hughes follows three generations of shantytown women as they struggle to survive through hard work, cunning and triage. It is a story of class relations told at the most basic level of bodies, emotions, desires and needs. Most disturbing – and controversial – is her finding that mother love, as conventionally understood, is something of a bourgeois myth, a luxury for those who can reasonably expect, as these women cannot, that their infants will live.",0520075374,9780520075375),Paperback,,632 pages,"

The fifth part of Cao Xueqin's magnificent saga, ""The Dreamer Awakes"", was carefully edited and completed by Gao E some decades later. It continues the story of the changing fortunes of the Jia dynasty, focussing on Bao-yu, now married to Bao-chai, after the tragic death of his beloved Dai-yu. Against such worldly elements as death, financial ruin, marriage, decadence and corruption, his karmic journey unfolds. Like a sleepwalker through life, Bao-yu is finally awakened by a vision, which reveals to him that life itself is merely a dream, 'as moonlight mirrored in the water'.",0140443266,9780140443264),Paperback,,603 pages,"

","A revealing look at Iran by an American journalist with an insider’s access behind Persian wallsThe grandson of an eminent ayatollah and the son of an Iranian diplomat, now an American citizen, Hooman Majd is, in a way, both 100 percent Iranian and 100 percent American, combining an insider’s knowledge of how Iran works with a remarkable ability to explain its history and its quirks to Western readers. In The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, he paints a portrait of a country that is fiercely proud of its Persian heritage, mystified by its outsider status, and scornful of the idea that the United States can dictate how it should interact with the community of nations.With wit, style, and an unusual ability to get past the typical sound bite on Iran, Majd reveals the paradoxes inherent in the Iranian character which have baffled Americans for more than thirty years. Meeting with sartorially challenged government officials in the presidential palace; smoking opium with an addicted cleric, his family, and friends; drinking fine whiskey at parties in fashionable North Tehran; and gingerly self-flagellating in a celebration of Ashura, Majd takes readers on a rare tour of Iran and shares insights shaped by his complex heritage. He considers Iran as a Muslim country, as a Shiite country, and, perhaps above all, as a Persian one. Majd shows that as Shiites marked by an inferiority complex, and Persians marked by a superiority complex, Iranians are fiercely devoted to protecting their rights, a factor that has contributed to their intransigence over their nuclear programs. He points to the importance of the Persian view of privacy, arguing that the stability of the current regime owes much to the freedom Iranians have to behave as they wish behind “Persian walls.” And with wry affection, Majd describes the Persian concept of ta’arouf, an exaggerated form of polite self-deprecation that may explain some of Iranian President Ahmadinejad’s more bizarre public moments. With unforgettable portraits of Iranians, from government figures to women cab drivers to reform-minded Ayatollahs, Majd brings to life a country that is deeply religious yet highly cosmopolitan, authoritarian yet with democratic and reformist traditions—an Iran that is a more nuanced nemesis to the United States than it is typically portrayed to be.",0385523343,9780385523349),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","A beloved American writer whose books are championed by critics and readers alike, Sherman Alexie has been hailed by Time as ""one of the better new novelists, Indian or otherwise."" In these stories, we meet the kind of American Indians we rarely see in literature -- the kind who pay their bills, hold down jobs, fall in and out of love. A Spokane Indian journalist transplanted from the reservation to the city picks up a hitchhiker, a Lummi boxer looking to take on the toughest Indian in the world. A Spokane son waits for his diabetic father to come home from the hospital, tossing out the Hershey Kisses the father has hidden all over the house. An estranged interracial couple, separated in the midst of a traffic accident, rediscover their love for each other. A white drifter holds up an International House of Pancakes, demanding a dollar per customer and someone to love, and emerges with $42 and an overweight Indian he dubs Salmon Boy. Sherman Alexie's voice is one of remarkable passion, and these stories are love stories -- between parents and children, white people and Indians, movie stars and ordinary people. Witty, tender, and fierce, The Toughest Indian in the World is a virtuoso performance by one of the country's finest writers.",0802138004,9780802138002),Paperback,,256 pages,"

Mayan legend tells of the Hero Twins, destined to confront the Lords of the Underworld and rescue their long-lost father from the realm of darkness. A two-thousand-year-old myth-or a prophecy of an apocalyptic battle for the soul of mankind? On December 21, 2012, a date long foretold by the Mayan calendar, Michael Gabriel disappeared from the face of the Earth after saving the entire planet from thermonuclear destruction. Less than a year later, his bereaved wife gave birth to twin sons, both possessed of extraordinary mental and physical gifts. Are these at last the Hero Twins? As crucial as the twins are, they are not unique. A third child has been born, blessed-or cursed-with the same superhuman talent and potential. Born into poverty, raised in obscurity, the seductive Lilith may be the key to humanity's ultimate future.

","Edgar Allan Poe: Selected Poems and Tales/Deluxe -- FROM THE PUBLISHER:For more than a century-and-a-half, Edgar Allan Poe's poems and tales have thrilled readers with chilling accounts of matters mysterious and macabre. Their somber poetry and rich moods of menace and melancholy have conjured some of the most haunting images in American literature: the accusing echo of the tell-tale heart, the beloved but doomed Annabel Lee, the gloom-shrouded House of Usher, the maddening tortures of the pit and pendulum, the eerie and enigmatic Raven.Dramatic and irreversible, Poe's work invites us to match our darkest imaginings to his vision of the world colored by grief and madness and haunted by specters of guilt and death. This illustrated edition captures Poe's best-known works in all their shadowy splendor through the incomparable art of Mark Summers. His striking full-page color illustrations and ghostly black-and-white pencil sketches reveal the skull beneath the skin of Poe's obsessed and mournful characters and subtly express their heart of emotional darkness that gives them life and purpose.The book also features and introduction by best-selling fantasist and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman, who discusses his personal relationship with Poe's writing and its enduring impact. ""Poe"", he writes, ""for all his short life and unfulfilled potential, remains as much read today, his finest stories as successful, as readable, as contemporary as anyone can desire."" This new edition of Poe's unforgettable writing is a colorful and imaginative tribute to this most contemporary of classic writers.",0760756740,9780760756744),Hardcover,deluxe,256 pages,"

Lovecraft A pioneer in the realm of imaginative literature, Lord Dunsany has gained a cult following for his influence on modern fantasy literature, including such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. This unique collection of short stories ranges over five decades of work. Liberal selections of earlier tales—including the entire Gods of Pegana as well as such notable works as ""Idle Days of the Yann"" and ""The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth""—are followed by memorable later tales, including several about the garrulous traveler Joseph Jorkens and the outrageous murder tale ""The Two Bottles of Relish."" Throughout, the stories are united by Dunsany's cosmic vision, his impeccable and mellifluous prose, and his distinctively Irish sense of whimsy.Here published for the first time by Penguin Classics, this edition is the only annotated version of Dunsany's short stories. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",014243776X,9780142437766),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","In the first pages of Rogue River Feud, Grey paints a tantalizing picture of the Rogue from its headwaters to where it spills into the Pacific Ocean.Zane Grey’s vigorous storytelling and portrayal of ... the wild make this novel one of his best. There is a deep emotional feeling for nature in the raw, for the great salmon runs, and for the clashes of men fighting for gold.Along the notorious Rogue River, gold seekers, crazed by the discovery of nuggets that made them rich overnight, are at war with one another. The river itself swarms with salmon, bringing along with them another kind of wealth and violent fighting between fishermen and the fish-packing monopoly. Into this scene comes Keven Bell, returning to face life after being handicapped by a disfiguring wound he received in World War I. Keven teams up with a broken-down fisherman and boatbuilder. When they try to buck the salmon-packing monopoly, they encounter violence and trickery; their boat is sunk and they are left to swim for their lives.Keven is tended to by Beryl, the daughter of a gold miner. His convalescence is slow, but the autumn days, fishing and camping, make a woodland dream of romance. But no sooner has an operation straightened out Keven’s injuries than he is framed on a charge of murder in the salmon-packing war. Keven must carry on as best he can, along with what help Beryl and her old father can give, to clear his name and ensure his and Beryl’s safety on the turbulent Rogue.This text refers to an alternate edition.",0061002143,9780061002144),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","From acclaimed historical novelist Kathleen Givens comes a magnificently conceived, intricately detailed novel that brings to vivid life the tumult, adventure, and passion of thirteenth-century Scotland, when Norse invaders laid claim to the land and its people—and an explosive clash of cultures, politics, and personal pride changed the world forever.On Scotland's western shore, the village of Somerstrath prepares for the joyous wedding celebration of Margaret MacDonald, the laird's daughter. But a dark storm of bloodshed and betrayal is closing in, as a merciless band of Vikings threatens the Highlands. Margaret is determined to hold the MacDonald clan together and to locate her abducted younger brother. But can she trust the noblemen from King Alexander's court, who insist that only by adhering to a betrothal conceived for political gain will she find safety? Or should she put her trust in an imposing half-Irish, half-Norse warrior? Gannon MacMagnus alone offers her hope of reuniting her family and vanquishing the barbarous Norsemen who would continue to rob her people of their God-given right to determine their own destinies. In whom should Margaret entrust the fate of the rugged, magnificent land she calls home?",1416509909,9781416509905),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Many Christians mistakenly believe that their only choice is either to reconcile themselves to a fundamentalist reading of scripture (a ""literal-factual"" approach) or to simply reject the Bible as something that could bring meaning and value into their lives. In Reading the Bible Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg shows how instead we can freshly appreciate all the essential elements of the Old and New Testaments—from Genesis to Revelation—in a way that can open up a new world of intelligent faith.In Reading the Bible Again for the First Time, Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile a scientific and critical way of thinking with our deepest spiritual needs, leading to an insightful experience of ancient text. This unique book invites every reader—whatever his or her religious background—to engage the Bible, to wrestle with its meaning, to explore its mysteries, and to understand its relevance. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh, new way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up the rich possibility of living a life of authentic faith.",0060609192,9780060609191),Paperback,,321 pages,"

In that book, he offered a rational explanation of why we should believe in God. Now, in The Prodigal God, he uses one of the best-known Christian parables to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation.Taking his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity, Keller uncovers the essential message of Jesus, locked inside his most familiar parable. Within that parable Jesus reveals God's prodigal grace toward both the irreligious and the moralistic. This book will challenge both the devout and skeptics to see Christianity in a whole new way.Look out for Timothy Keller's latest book, The Songs of Jesus, coming from Viking on November 10, 2015.",0525950796,9780525950790),Hardcover,,139 pages,"

Written in Henry’s own words, this exuberant, funny novel follows his eccentric course from bush league to the World Series. Although Mark Harris loves and writes tellingly about the pleasures of baseball, his primary subject has always been the human condition and the shifts of mortal men and women as they try to understand and survive what life has dealt them. This new Bison Books edition celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of The Southpaw. In his introduction to this edition, Mark Harris discusses the genesis of the novel in his own life experience. Also available in Bison Books editions are The Southpaw, It Looked Like For Ever, and A Ticket for a Seamstitch, the other three volumes in the Henry Wiggen series.",0803273371,9780803273375),Paperback,Second Edition,350 pages,"

","A haunting and triumphant story of a difficult and keenly felt life, ""Change Me into Zeus's Daughter"" is a remarkable literary memoir of resilience, redemption, and growing up in the South. Barbara Robinette Moss was the fourth in a family of eight children raised in the red-clay hills of Alabama. Their wild-eyed, alcoholic father was a charismatic and irrationally proud man who, when sober, captured his children's timid awe, but when (more often) drunk, roused them from bed for severe punishment or bizarre all-night poker games. Their mother was their angel: erudite and stalwart -- her only sin her inability to leave her husband for the sake of the children. Unlike the rest of her family, Barbara bore the scars of this abuse and neglect on the outside as well as the inside. As a result of childhood malnutrition and a complete lack of medical and dental care, the bones in her face grew abnormally (""like a thin pine tree""), and she ended up with what she calls ""a twisted, mummy face."" Barbara's memoir brings us deep into not only the world of Southern poverty and alcoholic child abuse but also the consciousness of one who is physically frail and awkward, relating how one girl's debilitating sense of her own physical appearance is ultimately saved by her faith in the transformative powers of artistic beauty: painting and writing.From early on and with little encouragement from the world, Barbara embodied the fiery determination to change her fate and achieve a life defined by beauty. At age seven, she announced to the world that she would become an artist -- and so she did. Nightly, she prayed to become attractive, to be changed into ""Zeus's daughter,"" the goddess of beauty, and when her prayers weren't answered, she did it herself, raising the money for years of braces followed by facial surgery. Growing up ""so ugly,"" she felt the family's disgrace all the more acutely, but the result has been a keenly developed appreciation for beauty -- physical and artistic -- the evidence of which can be seen in her writing.Despite the deprivation, the lingering image from this memoir is not of self-pity but of the incredible bond between these eight siblings: the raucous, childish fun they had together, the making-do, and the total devotion to their desperate mother, who absorbed most of the father's blows for them and who plied them with art and poetry in place of balanced meals. Gracefully and intelligently woven in layers of flashback, the persistent strength of Barbara Moss's memoir is itself a testament to the nearly lifesaving appreciation for literature that was her mother's greatest gift to her children.",074320218X,9780743202183),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","La pensée et le mouvant est le dernier livre publié par Bergson, en 1934, à près de 75 ans ; et pourtant, il y exprime avec une surprise renouvelée, comme si elle venait de survenir, son intuition la plus originale (et cela, dès le titre même). Cest un livre qui est donc animé par une idée unique, une unité plus forte peut-être que jamais ; et pourtant, cest dabord un recueil dessais (le deuxième après Lénergie spirituelle de 1919), dont chacun (plus encore que dans le précédent) vaut comme une uvre décisive à part entière, dont certains (comme lIntroduction à la métaphysique) ont déjà marqué leur époque, et qui, enfin, ne sont pas reliés entre eux seulement par cette unité de principe, mais aussi par des tensions, non moins profondes. Ainsi Bergson resserre-t-il encore, plus que jamais, sa pensée ou son intuition, la prenant directement, pour la première fois, comme objet. Il restreint même, en apparence, la portée de ce recueil, en la limitant, dans lAvant-propos, à une réflexion, rétrospective, sur sa « méthode ». Mais cette ultime concentration est aussi, on le voit, un ultime élargissement.",213045514X,9782130455141),,,,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Metaphysics', 'Cultural', 'France', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'Philosophy', 'Theory']"

","In 1978, when Michael Hart's controversial book The 100 was first published, critics objected that Hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history, but also to rank them according to their importance. Needless to say, the critics were wrong, and to date more than 60,000 copies of the book have been sold. Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publications of this revised and updated edition of The 100.As before, Hart's yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history. With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world's greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators--from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches. Hart's selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer's arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining. The 100, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor--a perfect addition to any history or philosophy reference section.",0806513500,9780806513508),Paperback,,556 pages,"

She's in a stuffy old attic with the Three Stooges-a.k.a. her so-called spirit guides. There's a demon who wants her dead, the same one that killed her mother two decades ago. No worries, say the Stooges. All she has to do is summon an angel. What could go wrong?Well, plenty when you summon the wrong angel. The next thing Tory knows, she's got one very bad-ass, pissed-off and sexy Archangel on her hands.Michael, mighty warrior, leader of an elite team of demon killers, is shaking in his heavenly combat boots. Not because he finds all humans distasteful. But because he'd rather face Lucifer himself than the woman his soul has just recognized as his mate. Binding himself to a mortal, one who will eventually die, is the one path he's sworn never to follow.It's too late now; his fate is sealed. With one touch, she becomes as necessary to him as the air he breathes.

","Baring It All Generations of werewolves have been secretly residing in a secluded valley a stone’s throw from Grundy, Alaska. So when a snooping Outsider comes to Grundy to investigate rumors of lycanthropic shenanigans in the area, the valley’s pack alpha, Maggie Graham, resolves to chase him away, even if doing so takes a quick bite on the butt. What a pity that researcher Nick Thatcher turns out to be so drool-worthy, and that his kisses make Maggie want to sit up and beg. Maggie just can’t seem to convince Nick to leave . . . and even worse, she can’t convince herself to stay away from him. Cross-species dating is problem enough for a harried alpha female, but on top of that, a rival group of werewolves is trying to move into the valley. With interpack war threatening, Maggie can’t afford to be distracted. Combining romance and a career can be tough for anyone; for a werewolf in love with a human, it may be disastrous. . . .",1439195870,9781439195871),Mass Market Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Happiness. It's what we all long for, what all human beings seek in our jobs, our relationships, our activities. We try so hard to be happy, and all too often we end up empty and unsatisfied. Why? Because, says Billy Graham in this classic work, we are looking for happiness in all the wrong places. We haven't learned the secret Jesus taught in the Beatitudes – that true, lasting happiness simply isn't to be found by seeking it directly. Happiness is a by-product, a bonus that comes when we seek what is really important. And the things that will bring us the satisfaction we long for are not necessarily what the world considers meaningful.Jesus did not have to have an outward stimulus to make Him happy, Billy Graham points out. ""He had learned a secret that allowed Him to live above the circumstances of life and fear of the future. He moved with calmness, certainty, and serenity through the most trying circumstances – even death! What was His secret? He gave it to us in the Beautitudes.""Presented with Billy Graham's characteristic vigor and simplicity in this landmark book, it is a secret that can transform your life.",0849943817,9781593280673),Paperback,,176 pages,"

","My name is Amelia Gray. I'm a cemetery restorer who sees ghosts. In order to protect myself from the parasitic nature of the dead, I've always held fast to the rules passed down from my father. But now a haunted police detective has entered my world and everything is changing, including the rules that have always kept me safe.It started with the discovery of a young woman's brutalized body in an old Charleston graveyard I've been hired to restore. The clues to the killer, and to his other victims, lie in the headstone symbolism that only I can interpret. Devlin needs my help, but his ghosts shadow his every move, feeding off his warmth, sustaining their presence with his energy. To warn him would be to invite them into my life. I've vowed to keep my distance, but the pull of his magnetism grows ever stronger even as the symbols lead me closer to the killer and to the gossamer veil that separates this world from the next.",077832981X,9780778329817),Paperback,,376 pages,"

","In a world where the strident demands of Islamic extremists capture the media’s attention, the courageous protests of Muslim reformers barely receive any notice. These include a surprising number of women who are prepared to challenge institutionalized persecution, risking derision, arrest, physical harm, and even death.In this inspiring compilation of Muslim women’s stories from around the world, the voices of these long-oppressed women ring loud and clear as they question ideology and culture, patriarchal and religious beliefs, and demand the social and political rights women lack in many Muslim countries. The reformers speak out with passion, humanity, and sometimes humor in these compact and often poignant biographies, bringing alive the harsh realities for women in many parts of the world. By surveying a wide range of Muslim reformers, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and North America, author Ida Lichter uncovers some significant emerging trends. For example, she notes that the majority of Muslim feminists would like to see reform contained within Islam. Many criticize their patriarchal culture for suppressing egalitarian views that they believe the Koran expresses and so they advocate a reinterpretation of the holy text. Some demand changes to discriminatory Sharia-based laws. Others campaign openly for political and educational reforms.Complete with a glossary and a list of helpful Web sites, this vibrant anthology makes use of reliable translations from original languages to demonstrate the groundswell of grassroots change that promises eventually to bring even the most conservative sectors of Islam into the twenty-first century.",1591027160,9781591027164),Hardcover,,513 pages,"

","Sixteen-year-old Tess's life has been shaped by her violin. From the moment she picked up the instrument, it's been clear she isn't like other kids. She is a prodigy, and her life is that of a virtuoso-to-be: constant training, special schools, and a big debut before an audience of thousands. But when she blows her moment in the spotlight, she throws it all away, moves away from New York City to join her father in Montana, and tries to lead a normal life--whatever that is. Tess has hardly arrived when she is drawn into a mystery: a hunt for the wilderness homestead of a lost pioneer who played violin himself. Maybe, through his story, Tess will find the strength to pick up her violin again.",0152026703,9780152026707),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

Venturing alone into the dark heart of war, armed with just a video camera, a digital camera, a laptop, and a satellite modem, the award-winning journalist covered virtually every major global hot spot as the first Internet correspondent for Yahoo!

Beginning his journey with the anarchic chaos of Somalia in September 2005 and ending with the Israeli-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006, Sites talks with rebels and government troops, child soldiers and child brides, and features the people on every side, including those caught in the cross fire. His honest reporting helps destroy the myths of war by putting a human face on war's inhumanity. Personally, Sites will come to discover that the greatest danger he faces may not be from bombs and bullets, but from the unsettling power of the truth.",0061228753,9780061228759),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Born on the day Iceland joined NATO, this novel's unstable narrator worries this and other incidental phenomena into a highly complex, hilarious, and tragic cosmology. More interested in David Bowie and the Beatles than the Nordic sagas that shape the lives of the working-class peoples of Reykjavik, Paul retreats into his own fantastic, schizophrenic, painful world. His madness springs from bits of reality and brighter strikes of insanity. Out-of-work and aimless, tormented by bouts of drinking and ferocious tantrums, Paul walks Reykjavik's streets scaring his family lusting after women, recounting petty humiliations, and imagining the forces that both guide and haunt him. Paul's behaviors lead him to Klepp, a psychiatric hospital outside Reykjavik where he plays out his days in therapy and frantic conversation with its resident patients. Sparsely inhabited, Klepp tends to a variety of disturbed people creating comedic havoc.",0312150539,9780312150532),Hardcover,,176 pages,"

","Some have claimed that'War is too important to be left to the generals, 'but P. W. Singer asks'What about the business executives?'Breaking out of the guns-for-hire mold of traditional mercenaries, corporations now sell skills and services that until recently only state militaries possessed. Their products range from trained commando teams to strategic advice from generals.This new'Privatized Military Industry'encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue. Whether as proxies or suppliers, such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. More recently, they have become a key element in U.S. military operations. Private corporations working for profit now sway the course of national and international conflict, but the consequences have been little explored.In this book, Singer provides the first account of the military services industry and its broader implications. Corporate Warriors includes a description of how the business works, as well as portraits of each of the basic types of companies: military providers that offer troops for tactical operations; military consultants that supply expert advice and training; and military support companies that sell logistics, intelligence, and engineering.The privatization of warfare allows startling new capabilities and efficiencies in the ways that war is carried out. At the same time, however, Singer finds that the entrance of the profit motive onto the battlefield raises a series of troubling questions'for democracy, for ethics, for management, for human rights, and for national security.",0801441145,9780801441141),Hardcover,,330 pages,"

","There Are Only 13 Bullets Between the World You Know and the World They RuleAll the official reports say they are dead - extinct since the late '80s, when a fed named Arkeley nailed the last vampire in a fight that nearly killed him. But the evidence proves otherwise.When a state trooper named Caxton calls the FBI looking for help in the middle of the night, it is Arkeley who gets the assignment - who else? He's been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don't: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that only the undead can.Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little afraid, but the fed made it plain that there is only one way out. But the worst thing is the feeling that the vampires want more than just her blood. They want her for a reason, one she can't guess; a reason her sphinxlike partner knows but won't say; a reason she has to find out - or die trying.Now there are only 13 bullets between Caxton and Arkeley and the vampires. There are only 13 bullets between us, the living, and them, the damned.",0307381439,9780307381439),Paperback,,323 pages,"

","In the Hugo-Award winning Hominids, Robert J. Sawyer introduced a character readers will never forget: Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist from a parallel Earth who was whisked from his reality into ours by a quantum-computing experiment gone awry - making him the ultimate stranger in a strange land.In that book and in its sequel, Humans, Sawyer showed us the Neanderthal version of Earth in loving detail - a tour de force of world-building; a masterpiece of alternate history.Now, in Hybrids, Ponter Boddit and his Homo sapiens lover, geneticist Mary Vaughan, are torn between two worlds, struggling to find a way to make their star-crossed relationship work. Aided by banned Neanderthal technology, they plan to conceive the first hybrid child, a symbol of hope for the joining of their two versions of reality. But after an experiment shows that Mary's religious faith - something completely absent in Neanderthals - is a quirk of the neurological wiring of Homo sapiens brains, Ponter and Mary must decide whether their child should be predisposed to atheism or belief. Meanwhile, as Mary's Earth is dealing with a collapse of its planetary magnetic field, her boss, the enigmatic Jock Krieger, has turned envious eyes on the unspoiled Eden that is the Neanderthal world . . . Hybrids is filled to bursting with Sawyer's signature speculations about alternative ways of being human, exploding our preconceptions of morality and gender, of faith and love. His Neanderthal Parallax trilogy is a classic in the making, and here he brings it to a stunning, thought-provoking conclusion that's sure to make Hybrids one of the most controversial books of the year.",076534906X,9780765349064),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Another rediscovered masterpiece from the Hungarian novelist whose Embers became an international bestseller--a sensuous, suspenseful, aphoristic novel about the world's most notorious seducer and the encounter that changes him forever. In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife--and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that Sándor Márai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.",0375712968,9780375712968),Paperback,,294 pages,"

","Between 1892 and the early 1950s, nearly 15 million people streamed through Ellis Island in search of a new life. Here are the stories of those extraordinary immigrants, largely in their own poignant words. Coming primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe, and from widely diverse backgrounds, the émigrés represented in this remarkable volume recount their adventures with dignity, wit, and unflagging honesty. Among the dozens of unforgettable narrators you'll meet are a Greek boy who, forced into the Turkish Army, escaped to the U.S. with the help of the Russian Orthodox Church; a young Polish girl who made the harrowing journey only to have to flee a ""white slaver""; and a Czech woman who fooled doctors into letting her travel despite being eight months pregnant.

","A best-selling volume of Pablo Neruda's poetry in an English-Spanish edition.Pablo Neruda is one of the world's most popular and famous poets, and in The Book of Questions, Neruda refuses to be corralled by the rational mind. Composed of 316 unanswerable questions, these poems integrate the wonder of a child with the experiences of an adult. By turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant, Neruda's questions lead the reader beyond reason into the realms of intuition and pure imagination.This complete translation of Pablo Neruda's El libro de las preguntas (The Book of Questions) features Neruda's original Spanish-language poems alongside William O'Daly's English translations. In his introduction O'Daly, who has translated eight volumes of Pablo Neruda's poetry, writes, ""These poems, more so than any of Neruda's other work, remind us that living in a state of visionary surrender to the elemental questions, free of the quiet desperation of clinging too tightly to answers, may be our greatest act of faith.""When Neruda died in 1973, The Book of Questions was one of eight unpublished poetry manuscripts that lay on his desk. In it, Neruda achieves a deeper vulnerability and vision than in his earlier work-and this unique book is a testament to everything that made Neruda an artist.""Neruda's questions evoke pictures that make sense on a visual level before the reader can grasp them on a literal one. The effect is mildly dazzling [and] O'Daly's translations achieve a tone that is both meditative and spontaneous."" --Publishers WeeklyPablo Neruda, born in southern Chile, led a life charged with poetic and political activity. He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the International Peace Prize, and served as Chile's ambassador to several countries, including Burma, France, and Argentina. He died in 1973.II.Tell me, is the rose naked or is that her only dress?Why do trees conceal the splendor of their roots?Who hears the regrets of the thieving automobile?Is there anything in the world sadder than a train standing in the rain?XIV.And what did the rubies say standing before the juice of pomegranates?Why doesn't Thursday talk itself into coming after Friday?Who shouted with gleewhen the color blue was born?Why does the earth grievewhen the violets appear?",1556591608,9781556591600),Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Zvi is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss. A careful study of his life is a revelation of the lengths to which a loving Lord will go to bring one soul safely home.",0915540231,9780915540235),Paperback,,202 pages,"

A classic novel from the bestselling author of Moloka'i and HonoluluBefore Alan Brennert became a bestselling author of historical novels, he wrote this lyrical fantasy in the vein of The Time Traveler’s Wife. Part love story, part deeply affecting character study, it is a literary tour de force chronicling the parallel lives of two men who were once the same man--until, as the poet Robert Frost wrote, “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood/And sorry I could not travel both/And be one traveler...”Thirteen years ago, Richard Cochrane left his small New England town to pursue his dreams of an acting career. But on some other level of reality there is also a Rick Cochrane, who chose instead to set aside his dreams, marry the woman he loved, and raise a family. Today, neither man is happy with the choice he made--but as their lives, once separated by time and chance, now draw closer together, Richard and Rick are offered another a last chance to discover “the road not taken.”Time and Chance displays the same vivid sense of time and place--and the vibrant, memorable characters drawn with compassion, warmth, and humor--that have made the author’s historical novels national bestsellers and reading group favorites.

","From the MacArthur and Whiting Award–winning author of John Henry Days and The Intuitionist comes a new, brisk, comic tour de force about identity,history, and the adhesive bandage industryWhen the citizens of Winthrop needed a new name for their town, they did what anyone would do—they hired a consultant. The protagonist of Apex Hides the Hurt is a nomenclature consultant. If you want just the right name for your new product, whether it be automobile or antidepressant, sneaker or spoon, he’s the man to get the job done. Wardrobe lack pizzazz? Come to the Outfit Outlet. Always the wallflower at social gatherings? Try Loquacia. And of course, whenever you take a fall, reach for Apex, because Apex Hides the Hurt. Apex is his crowning achievement, the multicultural bandage that has revolutionized the adhesive bandage industry. “Flesh-colored” be damned—no matter what your skin tone is—Apex will match it, or your money back.After leaving his job (following a mysterious misfortune), his expertise is called upon by the town of Winthrop. Once there, he meets the town council, who will try to sway his opinion over the coming days. Lucky Aberdeen, the millionaire software pioneer and hometown-boy-made-good, wants the name changed to something that will reflect the town’s capitalist aspirations, attracting new businesses and revitalizing the community. Who could argue with that? Albie Winthrop, beloved son of the town’s aristocracy, thinks Winthrop is a perfectly good name, and can’t imagine what the fuss is about. Regina Goode, the mayor, is a descendent of the black settlers who founded the town, and has her own secret agenda for what the name should be. Our expert must decide the outcome, with all its implications for the town’s future. Which name will he choose? Or perhaps he will devise his own? And what’s with his limp, anyway?Apex Hides the Hurt brilliantly and wryly satirizes our contemporary culture, where memory and history are subsumed by the tides of marketing.",038550795X,9780385507950),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","While cruising a dark country road late one Saturday night, five high school friends accidentally kill an old drunk. Hiding the body is easy. Lying about what happened is even easier. But lies have a way of breeding Monsters in Springdale, Kansas, and the Monsters have come to play.""Here’s the truth about growing up in a small town: you tell lies to survive.I worked at a grocery store during high school, part time on the evenings and weekends. I saw plenty of strange things there: avocados stuffed in a barrel of fresh popcorn left to rot, a coworker who punched holes in the caps of beer bottles with an awl, pies marked “Verda’s own home-baked” which came frozen on pallets with the Sunday dairy truck. I found a body in the trash bin once, but nobody can prove who put it there. No one can prove it was there.There were too many bodies for a town the size of Springdale. The name of the town is a lie, but the bodies aren’t. All of them. When you find a body lying with the outdated yogurt, wilted lettuce, and cardboard boxes, you make up stories to cope. You can’t process a body in the grocery store trash bin. A trick of the light, you say. The way the shadows fell across certain bits of debris like the coat hanger beast in a little boy’s bedroom. That head of lettuce, there, in the corner, looks like a human hand.Bodies are bodies.Dead is dead.And lies are lies.""About the author: Aaron’s stories have been reprinted in The Best of Every Day Fiction 2009 and 2010, listed as a recommended read by Tangent Online, received honorable mention in the storySouth Million Writers Award and Ellen Datlow’s Best Horror of the Year.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Nook,,0 pages,"

After a thousand years in a gray world, he has accomplished everything he set out to do. His brothers are safeguarded, and each has a woman who completes him. But with his centuries as a killing machine now left to the past, and without a hunt to define him, Zacarias wonders, for the first time in his life, who he really is.   The answer awaits him in the vengeance of an old enemy, in the consequences of a bloody family legacy and in Marguarita, a woman he once saved—his lifemate, his deliverance, and the greatest risk yet to both their lives.

","Stanley Kunitz's collected poems are an unassailable argument for age, experience, and impassioned observation. At 95, America's 10th poet laureate has many decades' worth of work under his belt, and his lyrics form a fine self-portrait even as they track his evolution toward the spare and simple. Kunitz's later poetry seems to effortlessly fuse feeling and form. With considerable wit, he sees into the life of things: a brook or a bird, a squirrel or a salmon is very much a part of nature, but it is also infinitely more, as anyone lucky enough to have read ""King of the River,"" ""The Snakes of September,"" and ""The Wellfleet Whale"" knows.  Kunitz's ""Reflections,"" which preface his Collected Poems, offer several modest credos. In one, he writes, ""I like to think that it is the poet's love of particulars, the things of this world, that leads him to universals."" And his work is ample proof that what Kunitz likes to think is right! In ""Robin Redbreast,"" for instance, the poet--living in an empty house that will soon be his no longer and facing nothing but blank pages--rescues a bird from some belligerent jays:  It was the dingiest bird you ever saw, all the color washed from him, as if he had been standing in the rain, friendless and stiff and cold, since Eden went wrong.  Alas, a moment's complacency at his own good deed comes to a quick end. There is no need for the poet to drive home his point--he merely provides the tragic image of an old bullet hole in the robin's head, through which he catches a glimpse of ""the cold flash of the blue / unappeasable sky."" Yet Kunitz did not arrive at this level without effort, and much of the pleasure of this volume lies in witnessing the growth of the poet's mind. In his first collection, Intellectual Things (1930), the young artist seems to have spent a good deal of time luxuriating in the early Yeats, displaying a sweet tooth for allegory and archaic inversion. Perhaps thinking himself ""a fierce young crier / Of poems,"" the youthful Kunitz pursued the sublime a little too relentlessly. His second book, Passport to the War (1944), is radically different, full of darkness and repudiation, its realities and anger very close to the surface. But it really isn't until The Testing-Tree, where family comes to the fore and influence is no longer cause for anxiety, that the poet finds his voice--one that has yet to desert him.  Several of Kunitz's finest, and most desolate, poems explore his father's suicide, which took place before he was born. Others, on Mark Rothko and Alexander Calder, celebrate creation in the face of immense difficulty. And there are poems, too, of resistance: this generous collection includes translations of Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Blok, as well as his own ""Around Pastor Bonhoeffer,"" which commemorates the pacifist cleric who was part of the plot to kill Hitler. Throughout there are also love songs--to nature and women. ""Route Six"" makes one wonder why there isn't an official term for a poem celebrating an enduring marriage--an epithalamium with, as they say, legs. After a quarrel, Kunitz suggests to his wife that they head for the Cape, taking with them those passions ""that flare past understanding"":  we can stow them in the rear along with ziggurats of luggage and Celia, our transcendental cat, past-mistress of all languages, including Hottentot and silence.  In ""The Layers,"" the poet asks point-blank: ""How shall the heart be reconciled / to its feast of losses?"" Reconciliation, Kunitz knows, isn't possible, but his work proves that the raptures of love and art are a strong consolation. --Kerry Fried",0393050300,9780393050301),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","The crimes of Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Dennis Rader, and other high-profile killers are so breathtakingly awful that most people would not hesitate to label them ""evil."" In this groundbreaking book, renowned psychiatrist Michael H. Stone—host of Discovery Channel’s former series Most Evil—uses this common emotional reaction to horrifying acts as his starting point to explore the concept and reality of evil from a new perspective. In an in-depth discussion of the personality traits and behavior that constitute evil across a wide spectrum, Dr. Stone takes a clarifying scientific approach to a topic that for centuries has been inadequately explained by religious doctrines.Basing his analysis on the detailed biographies of more than 600 violent criminals, Stone has created a 22-level hierarchy of evil behavior, which loosely reflects the structure of Dante’s Inferno. He traces two salient personality traits that run the gamut from those who commit crimes of passion to perpetrators of the worst crimes—sadistic torture and murder. One trait is narcissism, as exhibited in people who are so self-centered that they have little or no ability to care about their victims. The other is aggression, the use of power over another person to inflict humiliation, suffering, and death.Stone then turns to the various factors that, singly or intertwined, contribute to pushing certain people over the edge into committing heinous crimes. They include heredity, adverse environments, violence-prone cultures, mental illness or brain injury, and abuse of mind-altering drugs. All are considered in the search for the root causes of evil behavior.What do psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience tell us about the minds of those whose actions could be described as evil? And what will that mean for the rest of us? Stone discusses how an increased understanding of the causes of evil will affect the justice system. He predicts a day when certain persons can safely be declared salvageable and restored to society and when early signs of violence in children may be corrected before potentially dangerous patterns become entrenched.",1591027268,9781591027263),Hardcover,,430 pages,"

Little does anyone one suspect, he learned his talents at the actual Bauhaus school of design in Germany, before it was closed in 1943 by the Nazi's. He's a vampire. Rowan Broom is plying her trade as fortune-teller in her corner of the Goth club when she discovers that the darkly handsome guy watching her from the bar possesses a literal heart of darkness. If that wasn't trouble enough, Rowan learns through her tarot that the entire club is in grave danger.

The sorcerer intends to drain the vampire -- and use that power to kill everyone in the bar. Suddenly Rowan is embroiled in the bizarre task of rescuing a vampire.

","The Kingdom of Frewyn is being invaded by the Galleisian infantry and at the forefront of the battle is Boudicca MacDaede, a First Captain in the Frewyn armed forces. Her regiment is charged with defending the borders between the two nations, but when Frewyn’s last line of defense falls, Captain MacDaede enlists the assistance of a Haanta, one of giants from the islands to the far north. Promising to free him from his imprisonment in exchange for his help, she gains his trust long enough for them to win the battle and save the Frewyn border from being breached. The giant’s freedom is granted, but Rautu cannot return home unless he redeems himself in the eyes of his people for his past transgressions. He is offered a place by the captain’s side, and together, they defeat the Galleisian forces and become the saviors of Frewyn.One year later, King Alasdair Brennin takes the Frewyn throne, Boudicca is made commander, Gallei and Frewyn reach an accord, and Rautu is granted an invitation home. He is eager to return and see his brothers but finds it difficult to leave Frewyn without Boudicca at his side. He has become accustomed to her company and the idea of being made to live without her begins to distress him. Rautu invites the commander to the islands in hopes of finding a way for them to remain together, but when they arrive at the white shores of Sanhedhran, not everything goes as planned: one of the dangerous Haanta magi is freed, Rautu’s three brothers are strangely missing, and the neighboring nation of Thellis leads an attack on the islands.Together, the commander and the Den Asaan Rautu must find a way to unite their two nations and defend against the Thellisian fleets, but can they do so successfully when outside forces are attempting to keep them apart?",English,English,Paperback,,185 pages,"

",""". . . full of intellectual treats and tricks, of whimsy and deep scientific philosophy. It is highbrow entertainment at its best, a teasing challenge to all who aspire to think about the universe."" — New York Herald TribuneOne of the world's foremost nuclear physicists (celebrated for his theory of radioactive decay, among other accomplishments), George Gamow possessed the unique ability of making the world of science accessible to the general reader.He brings that ability to bear in this delightful expedition through the problems, pleasures, and puzzles of modern science. Among the topics scrutinized with the author's celebrated good humor and pedagogical prowess are the macrocosm and the microcosm, theory of numbers, relativity of space and time, entropy, genes, atomic structure, nuclear fission, and the origin of the solar system.In the pages of this book readers grapple with such crucial matters as whether it is possible to bend space, why a rocket shrinks, the ""end of the world problem,"" excursions into the fourth dimension, and a host of other tantalizing topics for the scientifically curious. Brimming with amusing anecdotes and provocative problems, One Two Three . . . Infinity also includes over 120 delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by the author, adding another dimension of good-natured charm to these wide-ranging explorations.Whatever your level of scientific expertise, chances are you'll derive a great deal of pleasure, stimulation, and information from this unusual and imaginative book. It belongs in the library of anyone curious about the wonders of the scientific universe. ""In One Two Three . . . Infinity, as in his other books, George Gamow succeeds where others fail because of his remarkable ability to combine technical accuracy, choice of material, dignity of expression, and readability."" — Saturday Review of Literature",0486256642,9780486256641),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","Two full novels collected in one edition formatted for the Kindle. WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM [1874-1965] was a British writer of novels, plays, and short stories. He was a medical student at King's College London. While a student learning midwifery in the London slum of Lambeth, He wrote Liza of Lambeth (1897). The novel was a hit, selling out its first edition in a few weeks. This success convinced Maugham to write full time. By 1914, he produced ten novels and ten plays. In World War I, he was one of the ""Literary Ambulance Drivers"" including Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos and E. E. Cummings. While serving near Dunkirk, he proof-read Of Human Bondage (1915). Theodore Dreiser considered Of Human Bondage ""a work of genius."" In 1916, in the Pacific, he researched Paul Gauguin's life for his novel The Moon And Sixpence (1919). In 1928, he moved to the French Riviera, where he resided for the rest of his life. In 1947, he established the Somerset Maugham Award for British writers. V. S.

","Orson Scott Card's The Lost Gate is the first book in the Mithermages series from the New York Times bestselling author of Ender's Game.Danny North knew from early childhood that his family was different, and that he was different from them. While his cousins were learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family, Danny worried that he would never show a talent, never form an outself.He grew up in the rambling old house, filled with dozens of cousins, and aunts and uncles, all ruled by his father. Their home was isolated in the mountains of western Virginia, far from town, far from schools, far from other people.There are many secrets in the House, and many rules that Danny must follow. There is a secret library with only a few dozen books, and none of them in English -- but Danny and his cousins are expected to become fluent in the language of the books. While Danny's cousins are free to create magic whenever they like, they must never do it where outsiders might see.Unfortunately, there are some secrets kept from Danny as well. And that will lead to disaster for the North family.The Mithermages seriesThe Lost GateThe Gate ThiefGatefather",0765365383,9780765365385),Mass Market Paperback,,453 pages,"

","In August 1914 the two greatest navies in the world confronted each other across the North Sea. At first there were skirmishes, then battles off the coasts of England and Germany and in the far corners of the world, including the Falklands. The British attempted to force the Dardanelles with battleships - which led to the Gallipoli catastrophe. As the stalemate on the ground on the Western Front continued, the German Navy released a last strike against the British 'ring of steel'. The result was Jutland, a titanic and brutal battle between dreadnoughts. The knowledge, understanding and literary power Robert K. Massie brings to this story is unparalleled. There will never again be a war like this in which seagoing monsters hurl shells at each other until one side is destroyed. The story is driven by some of the most dramatically intriguing personalities in history: Churchill and Jacky Fisher, Jellicoe and Beatty. And then there were the powerful Germans - von Pohl, Scheer, Hipper, and the grand old fork-bearded genius Tirpitz. Castles of Steel is a book about leadership and command, bravery and timidity, genius and folly, qualities which are of course displayed magnificently by Robert K. Massie's literary mastery.",1844134113,9781844134113),Paperback,,880 pages,"

","Loop me in, odd one.The words, spoken in the deep of night by a sleeping child, chill the young man watching over her. For this was a favorite phrase of Stormy Llewellyn, his lost love, and Stormy is dead, gone forever from this world. In the haunted halls of the isolated monastery where he had sought peace, Odd Thomas is stalking spirits of an infinitely darker nature.Through two New York Times bestselling novels Odd Thomas has established himself as one of the most beloved and unique fictional heroes of our time. Now, wielding all the power and magic of a master storyteller at the pinnacle of his craft, Dean Koontz follows Odd into a singular new world where he hopes to make a fresh beginning—but where he will meet an adversary as old and inexorable as time itself.St. Bartholomew’s Abbey sits in majestic solitude amid the wild peaks of California’s high Sierra, a haven for children otherwise abandoned, and a sanctuary for those seeking insight. Odd Thomas has come here to learn to live fully again, and among the eccentric monks, their other guests, and the nuns and young students of the attached convent school, he has begun to find his way. The silent spirits of the dead who visited him in his earlier life are mercifully absent, save for the bell-ringing Brother Constantine and Odd’s steady companion, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.But trouble has a way of finding Odd Thomas, and it slinks back onto his path in the form of the sinister bodachs he has met previously, the black shades who herald death and disaster, and who come late one December night to hover above the abbey’s most precious charges. For Odd is about to face an enemy who eclipses any he has yet encountered, as he embarks on a journey of mystery, wonder, and sheer suspense that surpasses all that has come before.",0553804804,9780553804805),Hardcover,,364 pages,"

The book details the history of the penguins and is written as a critique of human nature, and is also a satire on France's political history, including the Dreyfus affair. Morals, customs and laws are satirised within the context of the fictional land of Penguinia, where the animals were baptised erroneously by the myopic Abbot Mal. The book is ultimately concerned with the perfectibility of mankind. As soon as the Penguins are transformed into humans, they begin robbing and murdering each other.

","From the bestselling author of The Hidden Diary of Marie Antoinette comes a dramatic novel and powerful love story about the last Russian imperial family.It is 1989 and Daria Gradov is an elderly grandmother living in the rural West. What neighbors and even her children don’t know, however, is that she is not who she claims to be—the widow of a Russian immigrant of modest means. In actuality she began her life as the Grand Duchess Tatiana, known as Tania to her parents, Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra.And so begins the latest entrancing historical entertainment by Carolly Erickson. At its center is young Tania, who lives a life of incomparable luxury in pre-Revolutionary Russia, from the magnificence of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to the family’s private enclave outside the capital. Tania is one of four daughters, and the birth of her younger brother Alexei is both a blessing and a curse. When he is diagnosed with hemophilia and the key to his survival lies in the mysterious power of the illiterate monk Rasputin, it is merely an omen of much worse things to come. Soon war breaks out and revolution sweeps the family from power and into claustrophobic imprisonment in Siberia. Into Tania’s world comes a young soldier whose life she helps to save and who becomes her partner in daring plans to rescue the imperial family from certain death.",0312367384,9780312367381),Hardcover,,325 pages,"

",""" ""تحت ظلال الزيزفون sous les tilleuls"" هي الرواية التي كتبها الأديب الفرنسي الفونس كار (1808-1890)، وقد أطلع المنفلوطي على تعريبها. فأعجب بها وأعاد صياغتها بأسلوبه الخاص، ونشرها تحت عنوان ""ماجدولين"" أو""تحت ظلال الزيزفون"". والرواية هي باكورة أعمال ألفونس كار الأدبية كتبها متأثر بالمدرسة الرومانسية التي سيطرت على الأدب في تلك الحقبة من تاريخ فرنسا، وقد اعتمد على أسلوب المراسلة في تدوين أحداثها تاركاً لعنصر الخيال دوراً أساسياً في تحريك أشخاص الرواية بين أحضان الطبيعة الخارجية التي أحبها الكاتب وجعلها الإطار الأساسي لروايته. لقد تأثر المنفلوطي برواية ألفونس كار، وبادر إلى نقلها إلى اللغة العربية، لما فيها من دعوة صريحة إلى التماسك بقيم الحق والخير والجمال التي تجسدها البيئة القروية الريفية الساذجة. فأحداث القصة تدور في جوّ ريفي، يتميز بالبساطة والعفوية والصدق والإخلاص والقناعة، شبيه بالجو الذي نشأ فيه المنفلوطي بمصر، على خلاف حياة المدينة القائمة على الخداع والكذب والغش، والنفاق، حيث يتهافت الناس على جمع المال دون مراعاة أبسط المبادئ والقيم الخلقية. والرواية تحاول التأكيد على أن الخلاف الحاد بين أحدهما يعتبر أن السعادة هي نتيجة نجاح المرء في التلاؤم والتكيف مع الظروف الواقعية التي تحيط به، والمفهوم الآخر يعتبر أن المال هو مفتاح السعادة أياً كانت الوسائل المستخدمة في الحصول عليه.""",2745123874,2745123874,Paperback,Second Edition,184 pages,"

","""Controversial in both life and art, Francis Bacon was one of the most important painters of the twentieth century. His monumental, unsettling images have an extraordinary power to disturb, shock, and haunt the spectator, ""to unlock the valves of feeling and therefore return the onlooker to life more violently"".Eminent writer and curator David Sylvester provides the definitive account of the career of an artist whose friend and collaborator he was for more than forty years. Drawing on his unparalleled personal knowledge of Bacon's inspirations and intentions, he first offers a critical overview of the development of Bacon's work from 1933 to the early 1990s, and then addresses its crucial aspects. Sylvester also reproduces previously unpublished extracts from his celebrated conversations with Bacon in which the artist speaks about himself, modern painters, and the art of the past. Finally, he gives a brief account of Bacon's life, correcting errors that elsewhere have been presented as facts.Accompanying the incisive and revealing text are reproductions of almost every Bacon work discussed, including twelve triptych fold-outs. The most complete work on Bacon yet, this book constitutes a portrait of one of the creative geniuses of our age by a writer of comparable distinction.",0500274754,9780500274750),Paperback,Third Enlarged Edition,208 pages,"

","Life changes in an instant. On a foggy beach. In the seconds when Abby Mason—photographer, fiancée soon-to-be-stepmother—looks into her camera and commits her greatest error. Heartbreaking, uplifting, and beautifully told, here is the riveting tale of a family torn apart, of the search for the truth behind a child’s disappearance, and of one woman’s unwavering faith in the redemptive power of love—all made startlingly fresh through Michelle Richmond’s incandescent sensitivity and extraordinary insight.Six-year-old Emma vanished into the thick San Francisco fog. Or into the heaving Pacific. Or somewhere just beyond: to a parking lot, a stranger’s van, or a road with traffic flashing by. Devastated by guilt, haunted by her fears about becoming a stepmother, Abby refuses to believe that Emma is dead. And so she searches for clues about what happened that morning—and cannot stop the flood of memories reaching from her own childhood to illuminate that irreversible moment on the beach.Now, as the days drag into weeks, as the police lose interest and fliers fade on telephone poles, Emma’s father finds solace in religion and scientific probability—but Abby can only wander the beaches and city streets, attempting to recover the past and the little girl she lost. With her life at a crossroads, she will leave San Francisco for a country thousands of miles away. And there, by the side of another sea, on a journey that has led her to another man and into a strange subculture of wanderers and surfers, Abby will make the most astounding discovery of all—as the truth of Emma’s disappearance unravels with stunning force.A profoundly original novel of family, loss, and hope—of the choices we make and the choices made for us—The Year of Fog beguiles with the mysteries of time and memory even as it lays bare the deep and wondrous workings of the human heart. The result is a mesmerizing tour de force that will touch anyone who knows what it means to love a child.",0385340117,9780385340113),Hardcover,,369 pages,"

It’s festering inside her, because in the gothic Annapolis Valley, hey, that’s what you do — you never show and you never, ever tell.As she dashes from her wedding altar on the run of her life, ardently wanting to understand what has brought her to this moment, Serrie sweeps us up in an exhilarating and poignant journey from rural Nova Scotia to London bars, to strip clubs by the docks, through mental hospital wards and rehab centres, back to quiet verandahs and porch swings in serene Lupin Cove. Along the way we meet a delightful array of off-beat characters including Serrie’s best friends, Dearie and Elizabeth: Dearie, the anglicized Acadian who wants to go to New Orleans to find her Cajun relatives, and Elizabeth, who would like nothing better than to spend the rest of her life picking strawberries.Heave explores the joys and agonies of family, of what one generation inherits from the next, and of how past and present are inexorably linked.

Meanwhile, their friend Bill Cantwell heads to Manhattan in search of his missing niece, a fledgling musician with lots of attitude. Back in Boston, Jack's sister, Courtney, is left to hold the fort. But Jasmine, the sultry Prowler who barely survived her run-in with them in Boston, has begun to build a new pack in New York. When Bill probes the Prowler underground, he finds old friends, secret alliances, and betrayal, and his predicament draws Courtney away from Boston on a quest to make sure the man she loves gets home safely.

","The last decades of the nineteenth century were a violent period in China’s history marked by humiliating foreign incursions and domestic rebellion, ultimately ending in the demise of the Ch’ing dynasty. The only constant during this tumultuous time was the power wielded by one person, the resilient, ever-resourceful Tzu Hsi, Lady Yehonala -- or Empress Orchid, as readers came to know her in Anchee Min’s critically acclaimed novel covering the first part of her life.The Last Empress is the story of Orchid’s dramatic transition from a strong-willed, instinctive young woman to a wise and politically savvy leader who ruled China for more than four decades. Moving from the intimacy of the concubine quarters into the spotlight of the world stage, Orchid must face not only the perilous condition of her empire but also a series of devastating personal losses, as first her son and then her adopted son succumb to early death. Yearning only to step aside, and yet growing constantly into her role, only she—allied with the progressives, but loyal to the conservative Manchu clan of her dynasty—can hold the nation’s rival factions together.Anchee Min offers a powerful revisionist portrait based on extensive research of one of the most important figures in Chinese history. Viciously maligned by the western press of the time as the “Dragon Lady,” a manipulative, blood-thirsty woman who held onto power at all costs, the woman Min gives us is a compelling, very human leader who assumed power reluctantly, and who sacrificed all she had to protect those she loved and an empire that was doomed to die.",0618531467,9780618531462),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","A leading German metaphysician of the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) exerted an influence far beyond the hermetic world of philosophy, with adherents ranging from Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Mann. Among Schopenhauer's chief contributions to the field of philosophy are his rejection of the idealism of his contemporaries and his embrace of a practical variety of materialism. He jettisons the traditional philosophic jargon for a brisk, compelling style that employs direct terms to express the metaphysics of the will.In The Wisdom of Life, an essay from Schopenhauer's final work, Parerga und Paralipomena (1851), the philosopher favors individual strength of will and independent, reasoned deliberation over the tendency to act on irrational impulses. He examines the ways in which life can be arranged to derive the highest degree of pleasure and success, presents guidelines to achieving this full and rich manner of living, and advises that even a life well lived must always aspire to grander heights. Abounding in subjects of enduring relevance, Schopenhauer's highly readable work appears here in an excellent translation.",0486435504,9780486435503),Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Morangos mofados é uma das mais importantes obras de Caio Fernando Abreu. Com este livro, o autor tornou-se um sucesso editorial na década de 1980 ao expor o que há de mais profundo no ser humano.A série de contos que se entrelaçam como se fossem um romance trata de dor, fracasso, encontros, amores e esperança. Os textos abordam os anseios da geração dos anos 70 e a falta de perspectiva de concretizá-los. Apesar da passagem temporal, tais questionamentos podem ser considerados parte da realidade dos dias de hoje e conseguem envolver os leitores.O autor, homossexual assumido, é apontado como um dos expoentes de sua geração. Ele faleceu em 1996 e deixou como marca registrada seu estilo econômico e bem pessoal em obras permeadas por temas totalmente humanos, como o sexo, o medo, a morte e a solidão.",8522006466,9788522006465),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Buddhism is all about training the mind, and boot camp is an ideal training method for this generation's short attention span. The chapters in this small book can be read in any order, and are short and easy to understand. Each story, inspirational quote and teaching offers mindfulness-enhancing techniques that anyone can relate to. It is very possible (and perfectly okay) for people who are Catholic, Muslim or Jewish, for example, to still find the Buddha's teachings motivational. As the Dalai Lama says, ""Don't try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are."" There is absolutely no reason to argue over which religion came ""first"" or whose philosophy is ""better"". The important thing is to be kind, understanding, peaceful, patient and compassionate, which is actually fundamental in all religions. Whether it's Mother Teresa's acts of charity, Gandhi's perseverance, or your aunt Betty's calm demeanor, it doesn't matter who inspires you, so long as you're motivated to be better today than you were yesterday. Regardless of religion or geographical region, race, ethnicity, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, flexibility or vulnerability, if you do good, you feel good, and if you do bad, you feel bad. Amen! Hallelujah! And all that Jazz! If you agree that Buddhism isn't just about meditating, but also about rolling up your sleeves to actually relieve some of the suffering in the world, then become a fan on Facebook (and a follower on Twitter) to meet other like-minded-folks for beach cleanup events, feeding the homeless, caring for the elderly, community yoga, cooking classes, tutoring, or anything we can each do to help others. You're now a soldier of peace in the army of love; welcome to Buddhist Boot Camp!",English,English,Paperback,,73 pages,"

","When Roman politician Caelius inherits a stable of gladiators, there is one who captures his attention above the others...one whose eyes gleam with hate, pride and desire.Forced into slavery by Roman greed, Gaidres can barely conceal his contempt toward his new Dominus. Gaidres has a plan: kill Caelius and end the lineage of the Roman family that enslaved him. For his plan to succeed, he must make a show of respect and obedience--even when called on to service his master's desires.Gaidres is shocked to learn that in the confines of his quarters, Caelius doesn't want to dominate his slave, but to be taken by him. The sex is explosive as they break society's taboos and, to Gaidres's dismay, they form a tenuous relationship. Even when Caelius learns of Gaidres's plans for revenge, he knows he can't live without his perfect lover. Is he willing to risk it all to tame his gladiator's heart?88,000 words",B005GFAIDI,B005GFAIDI,Kindle Edition,,244 pages,"

She is the only woman who can tame the beast within him—even as deadly enemies plot to destroy them both.  The Highlander’s Touch  A trick of fate has sent Lisa seven hundred years back in time and into Scottish warrior Circenn Brodie’s chamber to tempt him with an all-consuming desire. For this woman he burns to possess is also the woman he has foresworn to destroy.   Kiss of the Highlander  Enchanted by a powerful spell, Highland laird Drustan MacKeltar has slumbered for nearly five centuries, until an unlikely savior, Gwen Cassidy, awakens him. Bound to Drustan, Gwen is swept back to sixteenth-century Scotland where a warrior with the power to change history will defy time itself for the woman he loves.  The Dark Highlander  Dageus MacKeltar is a sixteenth-century Scot trapped between worlds, battling with the thirteen Druids who possess his soul. When Chloe Zanders is drawn into his world, she will face the challenge of a lifetime: fighting thirteen evil spirits for the heart of one irresistible man.  The Immortal Highlander  Adam Black is free to roam across time in pursuit of his insatiable desires, until a curse strips him of his immortality and makes him invisible. The only woman who can see him is Gabrielle O’Callaghan. It is the beginning of a long, dangerous seduction, the price of which could be their very lives.  Spell of the Highlander  Jessi St. James first sees the gorgeous man staring out at her from the glass of an ancient mirror. Heir to the arcane magic of his Druid ancestors, Cian MacKeltar was trapped centuries ago inside the Dark Glass, and now an enemy will stop at nothing to reclaim it. And Cian will stop at nothing to protect Jessi from a deadly fate.  “[Moning’s] storytelling skills are impressive, her voice and pacing dynamic, and her plot as tight as a cask of good Scotch whisky.”—Contra Costa Times, on Kiss of the Highlander Includes a tantalizing excerpt from Karen Marie Moning’s beloved novella Into the Dreaming.",English,English,ebook,,2816 pages,"

","Love that lasts forever is the kind worth waiting for. Taylor Moore is an artist. With the bold colors of her palette, she gives life to her passionate memories of Jake Farrell. It's been ten long years since the dark-haired, green-eyed football player left town. In that decade, Taylor has been married to and divorced from the bitter man who always stood between them. After all this time, she still aches with hunger for that ruggedly beautiful boy from her past, unable to love another. But when Jake suddenly comes home, all grown up and claiming to have returned for her, Taylor's not buying it. She's more than ready to trust the gorgeous man with her body, allowing his dominant sexuality full control; she just refuses to trust him with her heart. But Jake's been waiting a lifetime for this woman, and he's not about to accept half-measures. He wants her full surrender, and Taylor must finally find the courage to stop waiting for it and start living for love.",1419950045,9781419950049),Paperback,,215 pages,"

","What exactly ""warps"" when you are traveling at warp speed? What is the difference between the holodeck and a hologram? What happens when you get beamed up? Are time loops really possible, and can I kill my grandmother before I was born? Until now, fans of ""Star Trek"" were hard pressed to find answers to vital questions such as these. Now Lawrence M. Krauss, an internationally known theoretical physicist and educator, has written the quintessential physics book for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.Anyone who has ever wondered, ""Could this really happen?"" will gain useful insights into the ""Star Trek"" universe (and, incidentally, the real universe) in this charming and accessible volume. Krauss boldly goes where ""Star Trek"" has gone -- and beyond. He uses the ""Star Trek"" future as a launching pad to discuss the forefront of modern physics. From Newton to Hawking, from Einstein to Feynman, from Kirk to Janeway, Krauss leads the reader on a voyage to the world of physics as we now know it and as it might one day be.Featuring the Top 10 biggest physics bloopers in ""Star Trek,"" as selected by Nobel Prize-winning physicists and other dedicated Trekkers!""This book is fun, and Mr. Krauss has a nice touch with a tough subject...Readers drawn by frivolity will be treated to substance."" ""--New York Times Book Review""""Today's science fiction is often tomorrow's science fact. The physics that underlies ""Star Trek"" is surely worth investigating.

In this new work, pastor Thabiti Anyabwile attempts to answer the natural next question: ""What does a healthy church member look like in the light of Scripture?""God intends for us to play an active and vital part in the body of Christ, the local church. He wants us to experience the local church as a home more profoundly wonderful and meaningful than any other place on earth. He intends for his churches to be healthy places and for the members of those churches to be healthy as well. This book explains how membership in the local church can produce spiritual growth in its members and how each member can contribute to the growth and health of the whole.",1433502127,9781433502125),Hardcover,,127 pages,"

","A routine interview between a reporter and an elderly baker brings out memories of darker times: her life in Germany during that last bleak year of WWII. As their lives become more intertwined, all are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.In 1945, Elsie Schmidt is a naive teenager, as eager for her first sip of champagne as she is for her first kiss. She and her family have been protected from the worst of the terror and desperation overtaking her country by a high-ranking Nazi who wishes to marry her. So when an escaped Jewish boy arrives on Elsie's doorstep in the dead of night on Christmas Eve, Elsie understands that opening the door would put all she loves in danger. Sixty years later, in El Paso, Texas, Reba Adams is trying to file a feel-good Christmas piece for the local magazine. Reba is perpetually on the run from memories of a turbulent childhood, but she's been in El Paso long enough to get a full-time job and a fiancé, Riki Chavez. Riki, an agent with the U.S. Border Patrol, finds comfort in strict rules and regulations, whereas Reba feels that lines are often blurred. Reba's latest assignment has brought her to the shop of an elderly baker across town. The interview should take a few hours at most, but the owner of Elsie's German Bakery is no easy subject. Reba finds herself returning to the bakery again and again, anxious to find the heart of the story. For Elsie, Reba's questions are a stinging reminder of darker times: her life in Germany during that last bleak year of WWII. And as Elsie, Reba, and Riki's lives become more intertwined, all are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.",0307460207,9780307460202),Hardcover,First Edition,279 pages,"

","In an extraordinary debut novel, an escaped fugitive upends everything two siblings think they know about their family, their past, and themselves.When eleven-year-old Annie first started lying to her social worker, she had been taught by an expert: Gran. ""If you’re going to do something, make sure you do it with excellence,"" Gran would say. That was when Gran was feeling talkative, and not brooding for days in her room — like she did after telling Annie and her little brother, Rew, the one thing they know about their father: that he was killed in a fight with an angry man who was sent away. Annie tells stories, too, as she and Rew laze under the birches and oaks of Zebra Forest — stories about their father the pirate, or pilot, or secret agent. But then something shocking happens to unravel all their stories: a rattling at the back door, an escapee from the prison holding them hostage in their own home, four lives that will never be the same. Driven by suspense and psychological intrigue, Zebra Forest deftly portrays an unfolding standoff of truth against family secrets — and offers an affecting look at two resourceful, imaginative kids as they react and adapt to the hand they’ve been dealt.",English,English,Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","Is there a way to always have a fat bank account, or a better job, or a delightfully smooth relationship, or a better body? And if so, is it really possible to realize these dreams now, rather than at some unknown future time?Lynn Grabhorn answers these questions with a resounding ""Yes!"" In Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, she says that what actually molds every moment of every day of one's life are feelings. Using a candid, witty approach to a genre riddled with self-important puffery, she shows how feelings - not positive thinking, or sweat and strain, or good or bad luck, or even smarts - set the tone for people's lives. She frames her theory as a four-part plan that covers all the big topics - money, relationships, health, and spirituality - without being pompous or preachy.A ""must read"" for anyone stuck in negativity.Softcover, Published February, 2000.",1571743812,9781571743817),Paperback,,288 pages,"

Each chapter in the book ends with Experiences of Transformation, exercises drawn from wisdom traditions or scientific investigations meant to enhance your direct experience of the material.Opportunities to actively engage in your own transformation and that of our world are woven into the fabric of your everyday life. Learning more about the terrain of consciousness transformation can not only give you a map, but can help you become the cartographer of your own transformative journey. Research over the last decade at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) has systematically surveyed hundreds of people's stories of their own transformations, as well as conducting over 50 in-depth interviews with teachers and masters of the world's spiritual, religious, and transformative traditions.No matter who you are,where you come from, or what your current path is - whether you seek to transform your life completely or simply make adjustments that will add a layer of richness and depth to your life - exploring the many ways that transformation is stimulated and sustained can hold great power. Weaving together cutting-edge science with wisdom from teachers of the world's transformative traditions this book explores how people experience deep shifts in their consciousness, and how those shifts can lead to healing and wholeness.Research over the last decade at the Institute of Noetic Sciences has explored in depth the phenomenon by which people make significant shifts in the way they experience and view the world.

","Juana of Castile, the last queen of Spanish blood to inherit her country's throne, has been for centuries an enigmatic figure shrouded in lurid myth. Was she the bereft widow of legend who was driven mad by her loss, or has history misjudged a woman who was ahead of her time? In his stunning new novel, C. W. Gortner challenges the myths about Queen Juana, unraveling the mystery surrounding her to reveal a brave, determined woman we can only now begin to fully understand.The third child of Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand of Spain, Juana is born amid her parentsâ€™ ruthless struggle to unify their kingdom, bearing witness to the fall of Granada and Columbusâ€™s discoveries. At the age of sixteen, she is sent to wed Philip, the archduke of Flanders, as part of her parentsâ€™ strategy to strengthen Spain, just as her youngest sister, Catherine of Aragon, is sent to England to become the first wife of Henry VIII. Juana finds unexpected love and passion with her handsome young husband, the sole heir to the Habsburg Empire. At first she is content with her children and her life in Flanders. But when tragedy strikes and she inherits the Spanish throne, Juana finds herself plunged into a battle for power against her husband that grows to involve the major monarchs of Europe. Besieged by foes on all sides, her intelligence and pride used as weapons against her, Juana vows to secure her crown and save Spain from ruin, even if it could cost her everything.With brilliant, lyrical prose, novelist and historian C. W. Gortner conjures Juana through her own words, taking the reader from the somber majesty of Spain to the glittering and lethal courts of Flanders, France, and Tudor England. The Last Queen brings to life all the grandeur and drama of an incomparable era, and the singular humanity of this courageous, passionate princess whose fight to claim her birthright captivated the world.",0345501845,9780345501844),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

Mandeville wrote a book about his voyage around the world that became a beacon that lit the way for the great expeditions of the Renaissance, and his exploits and adventures provided inspiration for writers such as Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats. By the nineteenth century however, his claims were largely discredited by academics. Giles Milton set off in the footsteps of Mandeville, in order to test his amazing claims, and to restore Mandeville to his rightful place in the literature of exploration.",031242129X,9780312421298),Paperback,,230 pages,"

But in this groundbreaking work, Jeff Pollard challenges us to embrace God's standard and to understand the historical roots of the rise of nudity and immodesty in modern culture. His perspective is thoughtful and balanced. Most importantly, he accomplishes what few authors on this subject have achieved: a treatise that avoids both license and legalism.

While seeking justice for the young man accused of this brutal double murder, Jesse must walk with the ghosts of men who died on another hill... men who were his comrades and friends in a war that crossed racial divides.  Gods Go Begging is a new classic of Latino literature, a literary detective novel that moves seamlessly between the jungles of Vietnam and the streets of modern day San Francisco. Described as “John Steinbeck crossed with Gabriel García Márquez”, Véa weaves a powerful and cathartic story of war and peace, guilt and innocence, suffering and love - and of one man’s climb toward salvation.    ",0452281156,9780452281158),Paperback,,320 pages,"

Outside his window, he sees helicopters and squad cars arriving at the scene of the crime. It’s a massive operation, but the next day, there is nothing about it in the logbooks. To learn what really happened that night, Michael descends into the black heart of Los Angeles, where he will learn the truth about his father—if he’s lucky enough to stay alive.",0804101701,9780804101707),Mass Market Paperback,,473 pages,"

","A revelatory exploration of the Jewish roots of the Last Supper that seeks to understand exactly what happened at Jesus' final Passover. ""Clear, profound and practical--you do not want to miss this book.""--Dr. Scott Hahn, author of The Lamb's Supper and The Fourth CupJesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist shines fresh light on the Last Supper by looking at it through Jewish eyes. Using his in-depth knowledge of the Bible and ancient Judaism, Dr. Brant Pitre answers questions such as: What was the Passover like at the time of Jesus? What were the Jewish hopes for the Messiah? What was Jesus' purpose in instituting the Eucharist during the feast of Passover? And, most important of all, what did Jesus mean when he said, ""This is my body... This is my blood""?To answer these questions, Pitre explores ancient Jewish beliefs about the Passover of the Messiah, the miraculous Manna from heaven, and the mysterious Bread of the Presence. As he shows, these three keys--the Passover, the Manna, and the Bread of the Presence--have the power to unlock the original meaning of the Eucharistic words of Jesus. Along the way, Pitre also explains how Jesus united the Last Supper to his death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday.Inspiring and informative, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist is a groundbreaking work that is sure to illuminate one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith: the mystery of Jesus' presence in ""the breaking of the bread.""",0385531842,9780385531849),Hardcover,,228 pages,"

","Philip Carlo's The Ice Man spent over six weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Top Mob Hitman. Devoted Family Man. Doting Father. For thirty years, Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski led a shocking double life, becoming the most notorious professional assassin in American history while happily hosting neighborhood barbecues in suburban New Jersey.Richard Kuklinski was Sammy the Bull Gravano's partner in the killing of Paul Castellano, then head of the Gambino crime family, at Sparks Steakhouse. Mob boss John Gotti hired him to torture and kill the neighbor who accidentally ran over his child. For an additional price, Kuklinski would make his victims suffer; he conducted this sadistic business with coldhearted intensity and shocking efficiency, never disappointing his customers. By his own estimate, he killed over two hundred men, taking enormous pride in his variety and ferocity of technique.This trail of murder lasted over thirty years and took Kuklinski all over America and to the far corners of the earth, Brazil, Africa, and Europe. Along the way, he married, had three children, and put them through Catholic school. His daughter's medical condition meant regular stays in children's hospitals, where Kuklinski was remembered, not as a gangster, but as an affectionate father, extremely kind to children. Each Christmas found the Kuklinski home festooned in colorful lights; each summer was a succession of block parties.His family never suspected a thing.Richard Kuklinski is now the subject of the major motion picture titled ""The Iceman""(2013), starring James Franco, Winona Ryder, Ray Liotta, and Chris Evans.",0312938845,9780312938840),Paperback,,505 pages,"

","The Fourth Way is the most comprehensive statement thus far published of the ideas taught by the late P.D. Ouspensky. Consisting of verbatim records of his oral teaching from 1921 to 1946, it gives a lucid explanation of the practical side of G. I. Gurdjieff's teachings, which Gurdjieff presented in the form of raw materials, Ouspensky's specific task having been to put them together as a systematic whole. Just as Tertium Organum deals with a new mode of thinking, so The Fourth Way is concerned with a new way of living. It shows a way of inner development to be followed under the ordinary conditions of life -- as distinct from the three traditional ways that call for retirement from the world: those of the fakir, the monk, and the yogi.The Fourth Way is a guide for those who seek a true way of inner growth under conditions open to the men and women of today.",0394716728,9780394716725),Paperback,,480 pages,"

What she doesn’t have is a husband, because she kicked her lousy, cheating ex to the curb nine months ago. Since then, Alli has paid her dues with seemingly endless self-improvement and seemingly endless mourning. Now she’s ready to move on and try new things.  Alli’s idea of “trying new things” is nothing like that devil-of-a-best-friend of hers. Somehow, Sara, the devil of a best friend, talks Alli into trying out a sex toy, sleeping with a younger man and letting a stranger in a lab jacket put hot wax on a place that should never, ever, ever see wax. And that’s only the beginning.  Alli never saw her life going quite like this. She also never thought she’d meet someone else who had the very real potential to change her life forever.  But she did. Enter the new guy. He’s gorgeous, refined and mature. He’s also marriage material. But that poses a problem for Alli, who renounced the institution of marriage when she renounced her ex. What’s a girl to do? They say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But what the heck happens when you can’t leave Vegas? Well, you spin the wheel, of course. You play the game and let the chips fall where they may.  Alli just hopes she can find them all. *******Caution!

","National Bestseller He was the foremost American of his day, yet today he is little more than a mythic caricature in the public imagination. Benjamin Franklin, perhaps the pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this masterly biography.Wit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin was in every respect America’s first Renaissance man. From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America’s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world’s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant. Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius. A much needed reminder of Franklin’s greatness and humanity, The First American is a work of meticulous scholarship that provides a magnificent tour of a legendary historical figure, a vital era in American life, and the countless arenas in which the protean Franklin left his legacy.",0385495404,9780385495400),Paperback,,765 pages,"

","Investors are all too often lured by the prospect of instant millions and fall prey to the many fads of Wall Street. The myriad approaches they adopt offer little or no real prospect for long-term success and invariably run the risk of considerable economic loss - they resemble speculation or outright gambling, not a coherent investment program. But value investing - the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value - has a long history - has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with limited downside risk. Taking its title from Benjamin Graham's often-repeated admonition to invest always with a margin of safety, Klarman's 'Margin of Safety' explains the philosophy of value investing, and perhaps more importantly, the logic behind it, demonstrating why it succeeds while other approaches fail. The blueprint that Klarman offers, if carefully followed, offers the investor the strong possibility of investment success with limited risk. 'Margin of Safety' shows you not just how to invest but how to think deeply about investing - to understand the rationale behind the rules to appreciate why they work when they work, and why they don't when they don't.",0887305105,9780887305108),Hardcover,,248 pages,"

","With the publication of the ""Recognitions"" in 1955, William Gaddis was hailed as the American heir to James Joyce. His two subsequent novels, ""J R"" (winner of the National Book Award) and ""Carpenter's Gothic,"" have secured his position among America's foremost contemporary writers. Now ""A Frolic of His Own,"" his long-anticipated fourth novel, adds more luster to his reputation, as he takes on life in our litigious times. ""Justice? - You get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law."" So begins this mercilessly funny, devastatingly accurate tale of lives caught up in the toils of the law. Oscar Crease, middle-aged college instructor, savant, and playwright, is suing a Hollywood producer for pirating his play Once at Antietam, based on his grandfather's experiences in the Civil War, and turning it into a gory blockbuster called The Blood in the Red White and Blue. Oscar's suit, and a host of others - which involve a dog trapped in an outdoor sculpture, wrongful death during a river baptism, a church versus a soft drink company, and even Oscar himself after he is run over by his own car - engulf all who surround him, from his freewheeling girlfriend to his well-to-do stepsister and her ill-fated husband (a partner in the white-shoe firm of Swyne & Dour), to his draconian, nonagenarian father, Federal Judge Thomas Crease, who has just wielded the long arm of the law to expel God (and Satan) from his courtroom. And down the tortuous path of depositions and decrees, suits and countersuits, the most lofty ideas of our culture - questions about the value of art, literature, and originality - will be wrung dry in the meticulous, often surreal logic and language of the law,leaving no party unscathed. Gaddis has created a whirlwind of a novel, which brilliantly reproduces the Tower of Babel in which we conduct our lives. In ""A Frolic of His Own"" we hear voices as they speak at and around one another: lawyers, family members, judges, rogues, hucksters, and desperate",0684800527,9780684800523),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","The Power of the Powerless (Czech: Moc bezmocných) is an expansive political essay written in October 1978 by the Czech dramatist, political dissident and later politician, Václav Havel. The essay dissects the nature of the communist regime of the time, life within such a regime and how by their very nature such regimes can create dissidents of ordinary citizens. The essay goes on to discuss ideas and possible actions by loose communities of individuals linked by a common cause, such as Charter 77. Officially suppressed, the essay was circulated in samizdat form and translated into multiple languages. It became a manifesto for dissent in Czechoslovakia, Poland and other communist regimes.",0873327616,9780873327619),Paperback,,228 pages,"

When a young man named Rej discovers the body of a murdered Abover in the combes, their worlds begin to draw closer. He swears vengeance for the murdered man and takes a great risk in going above. There he is placed in the care of Donna, a beautiful young woman trapped in her life as a worker. Food and clothing are rationed, while slaves and workers are forced to live in meager barracks. But Rej and Donna have more in common than a miserable existence; they have weirdly identical dreams of dragons flying in a clear blue sky. They are even more surprised to learn that the city's cruel leader, the Arkel, is determined to find a way to bring just such dreams to life in order to literally scare the population to death. The connection Rej and Donna make leads them on a dramatic adventure to save their loved ones from the Arkel's terrifying plans. N. M.

","A powerful and original argument that traces the roots of our present crisis of authority to an unlikely source: the meritocracy.Over the past decade, Americans watched in bafflement and rage as one institution after another –  from Wall Street to Congress, the Catholic Church to corporate America, even Major League Baseball – imploded under the weight of corruption and incompetence. In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.How did we get here? With Twilight of the Elites, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, Twilight of the Elites describes how the society we have come to inhabit – utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom – produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.Upending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. Twilight of the Elites is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.",0307720454,9780307720450),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

When the controversial, reform-minded Bishop of London is found bludgeoned to death in an ancient crypt beside the corpse of an unidentified man murdered decades before, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury to help with the investigation. To Sebastian's consternation, the last person to see the Bishop alive was Miss Hero Jarvis, a woman whose already strained relationship with St. Cyr has been complicated by a brief, unexpectedly passionate encounter. As his search for the killer leads him from the back allies of Smithfield to the power corridors of Whitehall, Sebastian amasses a list of suspects that range from some of the Prince Regent's closest cronies to William Franklin, embittered son of famous American patriot Ben Franklin. Sebastian must also confront the well-guarded secrets of his own family's past—and a devastating truth that could ultimately force him to question who—and what—he really is.",0451228022,9780451228024),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

But there is no precise evidence to link the two cases, except for the tantalising email. In his first crime novel, Craig Russell introduces us to a new detective hero, Jan Fabel -half-Scottish, half-German -a man of conscience and imagination. Russell has also created a richly textured scenario where the City of Hamburg plays a central role -it is a city where the old Germany combines increasingly with the new, where gangs from Turkey and the Ukraine battle for supremacy. Blood Eagle is a violently exciting thriller and Fabel's desperate attempt to solve the case before more victims are discovered, gradually uncovers layer upon layer of intrigue. How can he track a murderer who leaves no trail, whose victims seem purposefully random and whose motive reaches far beyond greed and lust, into the darkest recesses of the human soul?",0099472589,9780099472582),Paperback,,496 pages,"

","For over a century, philosophers have argued that philosophy is impossible or useless, or both. Although the basic notion dates back to the days of Socrates, there is still heated disagreement about the nature of truth, reality, knowledge, the good, and God. This may make little practical difference to our lives, but it leaves us with a feeling of radical uncertainty, a feeling described by Kolakowski as ""metaphysical horror."" ""The horror is this,"" he says, ""if nothing truly exists except the Absolute, the Absolute is nothing; if nothing truly exists except myself, I am nothing."" The aim of this book, for Kolakowski, is finding a way out of this seeming dead end.In a trenchant analysis that serves as an introduction to nearly all of Western philosophy, Kolakowski confronts these dilemmas head on through examinations of several prominent philosophers including Descartes, Spinoza, Husserl, and many of the Neo-Platonists. He finds that philosophy may not provide definitive answers to the fundamental questions, yet the quest itself transforms our lives. It may undermine most of our certainties, yet it still leaves room for our spiritual yearnings and religious beliefs.The final sentence of the book captures the hopefulness that has survived the horror of nothingness when Kolakowski asks: ""Is it not reasonable to suspect that if existence were pointless and the universe devoid of meaning, we would never have achieved not only the ability to imagine otherwise, but even the ability to entertain this very thought—to wit, that existence is pointless and the universe devoid of meaning?"" The answer, of course, is clear. Now it is up to readers to take up the challenge of his arguments.",0226450554,9780226450551),Paperback,,144 pages,"

The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet its apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick, to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmans writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious. The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalises magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: the art, science and culture of experiencing truth.",English,English,Paperback,,170 pages,"

","In this magnificent work of fiction, William T. Vollmann turns his trenchant eye to the authoritarian cultures of Germany and the USSR in the twentieth century. Assembling a composite portrait of these two warring leviathans and the terrible age they defined, the narrative intertwines experiences both real and fictional—a young German who joins the SS to expose its crimes, two generals who collaborate with the enemy for different reasons, the Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich laboring under Stalinist oppression. Through these and other lives, Vollmann offers a daring and mesmerizing perspective on human actions during wartime.",0143036599,9780143036593),Paperback,US / Canada,811 pages,"

This collection shows Miles and Ekaterin meeting (Komarr), getting to know each other as Miles tries to court her (A Civil Campaign), and the wedding (Winterfair Gifts), and, of course, Miles dealing with assorted family relationships. Miles deals with political problems along the way plus recounts the loves of his life to Ekaterin. ...none of them would marry him; they all went on to lead successful lives--so unlike her life on Komarr. The last on his list was Rian: ""And what does she do now?"" ... ""Now, She's an empress"" ... ""Can I take a number and get in line?"" ... ""The next number up"", he breathed, ""is one"".Contents:Komarr: Miles Vorkosigan is sent to Komarr, a planet that could be a garden with a thousand more years of terraforming; or an uninhabitable wasteland, if the terraforming project fails. The solar mirror vital to the project has been shatteredby a ship hurtling off course, and Miles Vorkossigan has been sent to find out if it was an accident, or sabotage. Miles uncovers a plot that could exile him from Barrayar forever - and discovers an unexpected ally, one with wounds as deep and honor as beleaguered as his own.A Civil Campaign: On Komarr, Miles met the beautiful Vor widow Ekaterin Vorsoisson, who has no intention of getting married after the heartbreak and betrayal of her first experience. But Miles has a cunning plan to change her mind. Unfortunately his clone-brother Mark and his cousin Ivan have cunning plans of their own, and the three-way collision of cunning plans threatens to undo Miles' brilliant romantic strategy.""Winterfair Gifts"": Miles and Ekaterin make elaborate preparations for their wedding. But Miles has an enemy who is plotting to turn the romantic ceremony into a festival of death.",1416555226,9781416555223),Hardcover,,880 pages,"

","Twenty-nine-year-old, independent, and self-assured Cambridge history professor Emma D'Eresby has one obsession in life: the curious journal of a seventeenth-century Englishman, a portion of which was left to her by her late grandfather.When an unexpected opportunity to study the journal in its entirety presents itself, Emma finds herself leaving Cambridge to take up a year-long position at a prestigious university in Maine. Anticipating a quiet year of research, Emma quickly discovers her work impeded by a range of unforeseen complications. From the start, there is the well-intentioned matchmaking of her vivacious Russian colleague, Elena Smalova, and the unexpected jailing of one of her post-graduate students. More troublesome, however, are the unsolved, brutal night attacks on women near the university and Emma's suspicion that they might be linked to the sinister English professor, Kort Staahl. But, most diverting and disconcerting of all, is Emma's growing attraction to the strikingly handsome Dr. Matthew Lyons, whose kind but deliberately distant demeanor puzzles her.Suspense and dread mount when Kort begins to take a persistent and unsettling interest in Emma. What are Kort's intentions, and what is he capable of? And the mystery surrounding Matthew only deepens when Emma discovers a link between him and the journal.

","Not Even My Name is a rare eyewitness account of the horrors of a little-known, often denied genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of Armenian and Pontic Greek minorities in Turkey were killed during and after World War I. As told by Sano Halo to her daughter, Thea, this is the story of her survival of the death march at age ten that annihilated her family, and the mother-daughter pilgrimage to Turkey in search of Sano's home seventy years after her exile. Sano, a Pontic Greek from a small village near the Black Sea, also recounts the end of her ancient, pastoral way of life in the Pontic Mountains.In the spring of 1920, Turkish soldiers arrived in the village and shouted the proclamation issued by General Kemal Attatürk: ""You are to leave this place. You are to take with you only what you can carry . . . "" After surviving the march, Sano was sold into marriage at age fifteen to a man three times her age who brought her to America. Not Even My Name follows Sano's marriage, the raising of her ten children, and her transformation from an innocent girl who lived an ancient way of life in a remote place to a woman in twentieth-century New York City.Although Turkey actively suppresses the truth about the murder of almost three million of its Christian minorities--Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian--during and after World War I, and the exile of millions of others, here is a first-hand account of the horrors of that genocide.",0312277016,9780312277017),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Jean Genet. Çocukluğunda 'piç' ve öksüz. Büyüdüğünde 'hırsız', eşcinsel ve yazar. Babasının kim olduğu belli değildi. Annesi ise onu doğar doğmaz terk etti. Küçüklüğünü geçirdiği yetimhaneden 10 yaşında kaçtı. Tıpkı daha sonra yerleştirildiği her yerden ve katıldığı sömürge birliklerinden kaçtığı gibi... Hayatını Avrupa'nın çeşitli ülkelerinde hırsızlık, kaçakçılık gibi suçlar işleyerek sürdürdü. Sık sık hapse girdi. Fransa'da hırsızlık suçundan onuncu kez yargılanması sonucu müebbet hapse mahkûm edildi. Yazdığı ilk roman André Gide, Jean Cocteau ve Jean-Paul Sartre gibi ünlük yazarların dikkatini çekince, bu yazarların cumhurbaşkanına verdikleri dilekçeyle cezası affedildi. Fransa'daki toplumsal hareketlerden Filistin mücadelesine, Amerika'daki Kara Panterler hareketine kadar çok sayıda mücadeleye, anarşızan bir tavırla destek verdi. Daha çok romanlar ve tiyatro eserleri kaleme almış bir yazar olan Genet, Hırsızın Günlüğü'nde otobiyografik öğelere ön planda yer vermiştir. Yaşamın en ücra köşelerine, hırsızların, fahişelerin, eşcinsellerin, pezevenklerin dünyasına son derece şiirsel bir dille, derin ve incelikli ruhsal çözümlemelerle nüfuz eden Hırsızın Günlüğü, aynı zamanda erkek bedenine düzülmüş en edebi övgülere rastlanılan bir yapıttır.

Whether surviving his father’s brutal assassination, presiding over a massacre, or weeping at the death of a beloved comrade-in-arms, Alexander never denies the hard realities of the code by which he lives: the virtues of war. But as much as he was feared by his enemies, he was loved and revered by his friends, his generals, and the men who followed him into battle. Often outnumbered, never outfought, Alexander conquered every enemy the world stood against him–but the one he never saw coming. . . .",0553382055,9780553382051),Paperback,,368 pages,"

I've never told them about my life before I met them. That shame can stay in the past. Weird thing is, they think I'm the strong one. The one with all the answers. The guru. When I'm offered a part on a TV show, they think it's all my dreams come true. And it is. Except that it'll bring me face-to-face with someone from my past - and memories I've kept buried.

","The appeal of Queen Maud's wardrobe is immediate: apart from its intrinsic quality, it documents an extraordinary era of fashion history, from the decorative but elaborate dress of the Victorian era to the streamlined chic of the 1930s: clothes for the modern working monarch. It encompasses the public and private like no other collection, from sumptuous state gowns and elegant evening dresses for official occasions to her riding habits, winter sportswear, and simple tailored suits for afternoons in the garden with her grandchildren. Maud engaged with contemporary fashion throughout her long life, and commissioned many of the great designers of the day, notably Worth, Blancquaert and Morin-Blossier. Her wardrobe illustrates the impeccable standards of couture dressmaking and tailoring of the period. Style and Splendour showcases some of the most spectacular garments, now in the collection of the National Museum of Art/Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in Oslo, and sets them clearly in the context of Queen Maud's life and times.",1851774548,9781851774548),Hardcover,,112 pages,"

But when she inherits a trunk of Elizabeth's journals, they reveal a woman far different than the cheerful wife and mother Kate thought she knew.The complicated portrait of Elizabeth - her upbringing, her marriage, and journey to motherhood - makes Kate question not just their friendship, but her own deepest beliefs about loyalty and honesty at a moment of uncertainty in her own marriage. When an unfamiliar man's name appears in Elizabeth's pages, Kate realises the extent of what she didn't know about her best friend, including where she was really going when she died.Written with grace, depth, and honesty, this is a story of two women - their friendship, their marriages, private ambitions and fears.

Tiene doce años, es hija de una familia numerosa, católica y de derecha que vive en un barrio acomodado, y lo único que le importa es escaparse a la calle donde sucede su verdadera vida. Las aventuras/desventuras de esta mini-adulta que todo lo descubre como quien ya todo lo ha visto transcurren en la convulsa Buenos Aires de los años setenta, entre la muerte de Perón y el Mundial 78. Los rituales inútiles de los padres, las miserias entre hermanos, la relación ambigua con su amigo colectivero, el internado para chicas pobres, su experiencia alucinógena, el tiro que se le escapa... todo va perfilando el viaje iniciático de esta autoexiliada de su colegio, de su familia y de su propia clase. Hay en Rumble amor por las imágenes, calidez en el trato de las emociones, ternura y una buena dosis de maldad. La música de las páginas del libro, el tono y el lenguaje resuenan con una gracia sorprendente. Maitena Burundarena logra dar vida a un relato admirable y a un personaje con voz original. La voz de una niña inocente y cínica que no puede dejar de transmitirnos su temblor y ese Rumble que al final de la historia se revela único.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,,,286 pages,"

Knowing that this rare artifact could be worth millions, the looter smuggles it into the US - but unbeknownst to him, he has brought something far more dangerous across the border . . . In the first week of December 2012, the codex finds its way into the hands of the Antiquities Curator of the Getty Museum, Chel Manu, the world authority on ancient Mayan inscriptions. She is torn between her duty to alert the authorities and this once in a lifetime chance to translate the codex herself.Meanwhile - in an LA hospital, an unidentified man is dying of Fatal Insomnia, a rare and highly infectious neurological disease. The patient speaks only in a garbled Mayan dialect - and Chel Manu is called in to interpret his dying words . . . just as countless others in the city begin to show signs of infection.

Joining forces with a group of notorious outlaws wasn’t part of the plan, especially not when one of them is determined to charm her out of her uniform at every turn. Working with the criminals might have been worth it if their efforts had saved the emperor, but it seems he’s not the rightful heir to the throne.... Evrial may have thrown away her career for nothing. To make matters worse, fate isn’t going to give her time to calmly decide what to do next. While she’s traveling back to the capital with Amaranthe Lokdon and the rest of the outlaws, Evrial uncovers artifacts that have been smuggled aboard their steamboat. They’re deadly enough to threaten the entire city, perhaps the entire empire. Oh, and they could kill everybody on board the boat too. These scenarios just weren’t discussed in the Enforcer Academy.

","Το ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" γράφτηκε σε μια εποχή πολιτικά ταραγμένη για την Ελλάδα. Η ήττα του 1897 ήταν ακόμα νωπή, το καθεστώς ασταθές, άνθιζε η διαφθορά, η εκπαίδευση δεν ανταποκρινόταν στις ευρωπαϊκές αντιλήψεις περί παιδαγωγικής. Από την άλλη, το γλωσσικό ζήτημα έκαιγε. Ο Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος, του οποίου ήταν μέλος και η Δέλτα, συσπείρωνε διανοούμενους, όπως λογοτέχνες (Βάρναλης, Καζαντζάκης, Νιρβάνας), εκπαιδευτικούς και παιδαγωγούς (Γληνός, Δελμούζος) φιλολόγους (Σαρής, Τριανταφυλλίδης), με στόχο μεταρρυθμίσεις που αφορούσαν στην εισαγωγή της δημοτικής γλώσσας στην εκπαίδευση και στην εξάπλωση νέων ιδεών για την ανατροφή των παιδιών.ΜΑΡΙΖΑ ΝΤΕΚΑΣΤΡΟΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" είναι ένα πολιτικό παραμύθι, είναι μια πλατωνική Πολιτεία για παιδιά, είναι η ιστορία μιας παραμυθένιας πατρίδας... Της Ελλάδας.Η Πηνελόπη Δ. είναι πιστή, όπως τ' όνομά της, στις ιδέες της μέσα στο βιβλίο, πιστή μέχρι το θάνατο σ'όλα όσα επέλεξε να ξεχάσει και σ' αυτά που τόσο μεθοδικά προτείνει.Τα ονόματα των πρωταγωνιστών τούς ανήκουν εκ φύσεως και διηγούνται κι από μόνα τους την ιστορία. Ο καλός βασιλιάς, που μετρήθηκαν οι μέρες του, λέγεται Συνετός, και μετά αρχίζει η βασιλεία του Αστόχαστου και της Παλάβως στη Χώρα των Μοιρολάτρων. Μέχρι που, από τη γειτονική χώρα, φτάνει, αντί για οικονομική βοήθεια, η ύστατη προσβολή: μια γαϊδουροκεφαλή με τενεκεδένιο στέμμα.Κι εδώ ακριβώς αρχίζει το παραμύθι για τα απογοητευμένα μάτια μας. Ο γιος του Αστόχαστου λέγεται Συνετός Β΄ και αρκεί να πούμε ότι στο τέλος θα παντρευτεί τη Γνώση, κόρη της Φρόνησης, λες κι έχει πάρει το αξίωμά του κατευθείαν από τον Σωκράτη.Ξαναδιαβάζοντας το βιβλίο, ένας μεγάλος θα νιώσει ίσως αμήχανα στις μέρες μας, αντιμέτωπος μ'αυτή την ελπίδα που δεν διαψεύδεται και με την αρετή που ξαναχτίζει τον κόσμο - χωρίς καθόλου μαγικά ξόρκια ή δανεικά κονδύλια, αλλά χάρη σε πολύ σκληρή δουλειά για το κοινό καλό. Γιατί ένας μεγάλος αυτόματα θα μετρήσει την απόσταση ανάμεσα σ' αυτά που επέλεξε να υποτιμήσει και να ξεχάσει και στα τόσα που μεθοδικά προτείνει το βιβλίο. Γιατί η Πηνελόπη Δ. έχει προβλέψει ακόμα και για τη σωστή εκμετάλλευση της φύσης, έχει σκεφτεί ακόμα και τους φυλακισμένους να ξανακάνει ανθρώπους μέσα από την πιο σκληρή, είναι η αλήθεια, δουλειά των λατομείων. Και παρόλο που δεν ξεφεύγει από την παρουσία μιας ελέω Θεού βασιλικής οικογένειας, το βασιλόπουλο είναι τόσο ταπεινό, εργατικό και ενάρετο που θα μπορούσε να είναι ένας αυτοδημιούργητος λαϊκός ήρωας.ΜΑΡΙΑ ΜΗΤΣΟΡΑΗ Πηνελόπη Δέλτα φώτισε τα παιδικά μας χρόνια, τα κατοίκησε και τα ενθάρρυνε δίνοντας ""όνομα"" -και μια σπάνια αύρα- στα ανείπωτα της ψυχής. Κι αν η γενιά μας στρέφει ακόμη το βλέμμα της νοσταλγικά σ' εκείνα τα αναγνώσματα, οι τάξεις των νεόκοπων αναγνωστών ούτε λιγότερο πυκνές είναι ούτε λιγότερο ένθερμες.ΖΥΡΑΝΝΑ ΖΑΤΕΛΗΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" (πρώτη έκδοση: 1910) αποτελεί πραγματικά το πιο συναρπαστικό εγερτήριο σάλπισμα για μια Ελλάδα της εργατικότητας, της τιμιότητας, της προκοπής, της μόρφωσης, της εθνικής περηφάνειας. Παντοτινά επίκαιρο.Η παρούσα νέα, συμπληρωμένη έκδοση περιλαμβάνει επίμετρο της Μαρίζας Ντεκάστρο και χρονολόγιο του Αλ. Π. Ζάννα (επιμελητή του έργου της Π. Σ. Δέλτα), το οποίο μνημονεύει τα σημαντικά γεγονότα της ζωής της Πηνελόπης Δέλτα, καθώς και παράλληλα γεγονότα της πολιτικής, κοινωνικής και πνευματικής ζωής στην Ελλάδα και τον κόσμο.Επίμετρο: Μαρίζα Ντεκάστρο Χρονολόγιο: Αλ.

","The Los Angeles police are investigating two strings of gruesome deaths. One killer has left several horribly mangled corpses; the other murderer kills his victims seemingly without touching them. The investigators have only a single set of fingerprints to link the two series of crimes. — Journalist Peter Jacobs is dragged into the investigation when he receives an anonymous call from someone who knows more than he should about the murders. They agree to meet at a specific place and time, but the caller never shows up -- …and the killings continue.When Julie Moore, a graduate student researching Near Death Experiences, falls in love with Peter, she has no way of knowing that she has placed herself in the deadly sights of the Cold One. The Cold One needs Peter to complete its mysterious designs -- but it does not hate Julie for interfering. It feels nothing -- no hate, no fear, no love -- and Its mere existence threatens all living things.Until recently, Jerry Washington belonged to a violent street gang. Trying to go straight, Jerry meets Susan Darly, an upper-crust high school sweetheart, and finds that life can be warm and wonderful. Then Susan almost drowns -- and is terribly changed. She has become as cold as death, and Jerry is determined to find out why.In India, Govinda Sharma's spiritual master has given him a dangerous job -- to pursue a seemingly invincible man, a blind man who can dominate another's will with a mere thought. This man will lead Govinda to the Cold One, and to a great truth that will shatter him to the core.Govinda Sharma, Jerry Washington, and Peter Jacobs are the last defenders of mankind.The Cold One knows who they are. It knows they are coming. And it does not care.",0812512456,9780812512458),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Freud was fascinated by the mysteries of creativity and the imagination. The groundbreaking works that comprise The Uncanny present some of his most influential explorations of the mind. In these pieces Freud investigates the vivid but seemingly trivial childhood memories that often ""screen"" deeply uncomfortable desires; the links between literature and daydreaming; and our intensely mixed feelings about things we experience as ""uncanny."" Also included is Freud's celebrated study of Leonardo Da Vinci-his first exercise in psychobiography.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

She lived in an upper middle class neighborhood in Santa Monica with her mom, dad, and Berkeley-bound older brother. She was a good girl, living a good life...but one party changed everything. One party, where she took one taste—and liked it. Really liked it.Social drinking and drugging lead to more, faster, harder... She convinced herself that she was no different from anyone else who liked to party. But the evidence indicates otherwise: Soon she was she hanging out with an edgy crowd, blowing off school and everything she used to care about, all to find her next high.But what goes up must come down, and everything—from her first swig, to her last breath—is chronicled in the diary she left behind.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,,,,,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Realistic Fiction']"

","Every successful brand in history is inherently unpopular with a specific demographic. Somewhere along the way, people felt they had to be popular in order to be successful, when in fact, the opposite is true. The brands playing in the space you want to dominate have already figured out the inherent power of being unpopular. In The Power of Unpopular, you'll discover the difference between flash-in-the-pan brand tactics and those designed to place you miles above the competition.Brand Personality: What's yours? Explore the importance of taking a stand and why brands become road kill without a distinct personality. Community: It's the number one thing that unpopular brands have figured out--learn how to build yours. Brand Advocacy: It knows no scale and your fans don't care how big you are. A guide for businesses on the proper care and feeding of their biggest asset. Erika Napoletano's irreverent yet never insincere tone takes readers on a colloquial and actionable journey, producing concepts that readers can immediately graft onto their existing business strategies. Complete with case studies of businesses from across the country, this is the book that couples theory with practice, creating pathways for business owners of any size and age.

A fiercely patriotic secular Jew, Pavel Bauer is helpless to prevent his world from unraveling as first his government, then his business partners, then his neighbors turn their back on his affluent, once-beloved family. Only the Bauers' adoring governess, Marta, sticks by Pavel, his wife, Anneliese, and their little son, Pepik, bound by her deep affection for her employers and friends. But when Marta learns of their impending betrayal at the hands of her lover, Ernst, Pavel's best friend, she is paralyzed by her own fear of discovery—even as the endangered family for whom she cares so deeply struggles with the most difficult decision of their lives.Interwoven with a present-day narrative that gradually reveals the fate of the Bauer family during and after the war, Far to Go is a riveting family epic, love story, and psychological drama.",0062034626,9780062034625),Paperback,,336 pages,"

Growing up in suburban Boston he enjoys the trials and tribulations that all adolescents go through. From the seemingly tyrannical mother, to girl problems to run-ins with the law. From there he escapes to college out in Colorado with his best friend, Paul, where they begin to forge new relationships with those around them.

Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man's and a nation's rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post-World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the scope of his projects and the theatricality of their presentation. Fest also, perhaps most importantly, brilliantly uncovers the destructive personality who aimed at and achieved devastation on an unprecedented scale. As history and as biography, this is a towering achievement, a compelling story told in a way only a German could tell it, ""dispassionately, but from the inside.""

","The Beatles' first performance in the U.S. was a milestone in American pop culture and the beginning of the British Invasion. For many of the 73 million people tuned in to watch, it was a life-changing experience. In fact, there is an urban legend that says that in the hour they performed on that February night in 1964, not a major crime was committed in New York City.Or was there?Meet Sonny Carter, an aging bank robber just recently released from prison after a 25-year stretch for bank robbery. Unrepentant, Sonny is determined to finish what he started back in '39: knocking over New York City's prestigious Hudson National Bank and Trust Company. It's not gonna be easy, though. Banks are a whole lot tougher than they used to be, and the members of his old gang are just about ready for the retirement home. And if that wasn't enough, adding insult to injury is the fact that the stool pigeon responsible for Sonny's lengthy incarceration is now the president of the very bank he wants so desperately to hit. This time, however, Sonny has a plan that just might prove to be foolproof, thanks to two unlikely sources: a sexy bank employee with secrets and a shady past, and the four unsuspecting mop tops from Liverpool about to make their historic American debut on the Ed Sullivan Show.Can't Buy Me Love is a lighthearted suspense novel featuring four ex-cons who plan and execute a five-million-dollar heist. In one night, these partners in crime face conflict with New Jersey mobsters, unexpected love, loss, and bittersweet triumph during one of the most important eras in American Rock & Roll history.",English,English,ebook,,331 pages,"

","The man at the door carries a vital message for the King of Caelius, but he is mortally wounded and near death when he knocks at Elspeth's door. The young woman, living alone in a ramshackle house, at the edge of starvation is stunned by the arrival and death of the messenger. Abandoned by her abusive father and left to care for her sickly mother until her death, she struggles to survive both physically and emotionally and fantasizes about rescue by the young Prince of Caelius to ease her misery. Seizing the opportunity to chase her fantasy, she sets out on the man’s horse to deliver the message herself.Arriving at the castle, Elspeth delivers the message to King Fredric, who warmly welcomes her, offering her acceptance and love. But trusting his response is a difficult venture: she must reconcile it with her lowly, abusive past, while facing her fears, and embracing the longings she has denied for a lifetime. Struggling with her inability to trust, she makes an astounding discovery and comes face-to-face with the depth of the King’s love.",The,#1,Kindle Edition,,286 pages,"

","Originally written under a pseudonym, this thrilling novel of passion in post-World War II London was banned upon its publication in the late 1960s, and is only now being republished under the author's real name. Edith Templeton creates an indelible character in the smartly dressed Louisa, a savvy young woman in the midst of a divorce who meets a charismatic man in a pub and within an hour has been sexually conquered by him on a garden bench. Thus begins her baffling but magnetic love affair with, and virtual enslavement to, Richard Gordon.Gordon, a psychiatrist, keeps Louisa in his thrall with his almost omniscient ability to see through her and she, in turn, is gripped by the deep, unexpected pleasure of complete submission. As they venture further and further into the depths -- both psychological and sexual -- she begins, for the first time, to understand her troubled history and the self that has emerged from it.In her clean, precise style, with every social nuance and motive exquisitely observed, Templeton delivers a tightly wound drama, unsparingly forthright in its description of how this form of love can bring incomparable rapture. Louisa's unsettling story has more than the ring of truth to it: it is told with urgency and relish, and its outcome, which leaves Louisa enlightened and changed forever, is profoundly satisfying.",0375421947,9780375421945),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","At fifteen, Iris is a hobo of sorts -- no home, no family, no direction. After her mother’s early death, Iris’s father focuses on big plans for his new shoe stores and his latest girlfriend, and has no time for his daughter. Unbeknownst to her, he hires Iris out as housekeeper and companion for a country doctor’s elderly mother. Suddenly Iris is alone, stuck in gritty rural Missouri, too far from her only friend Leroy and too close to a tenant farmer, Cecil Deets, who menaces the neighbors and, Iris suspects, his own daughter. Iris is buoyed by the warmth and understanding the doctor and his mother show her, but just as she starts to break out of her shell, tragedy strikes. Iris must find the guts and cunning to take aim at the devil incarnate and discover if she is really as helpless—or as hopeless—as she once believed. Lyrical, yet humorous, Barbara Stuber’s debut novel is the unforgettable story of a girl who struggles to cast aside her long-standing grief and doubt and, in the span of one dusty summer, learn to trust, hope, and—ultimately—love.",English,English,Hardcover,,272 pages,"

Lu weaves together the voices of multiple real and fantastic characters: her parents and their treasured yet forbidden bookcase; the mysterious vendors beckoning from Pear Flower Alley; the immortal martial hero; the reactionary opera singer and the black demon novelist; the whispering ghost and dancing fairy; and the author herself, discovering her storyteller’s voice in the military camps of her youth.

","This gripping and triumphant memoir follows a living legend of extreme mountaineering as he makes his assault on history, one 8,000-meter summit at a time.For eighteen years Ed Viesturs pursued climbing’s holy grail: to stand atop the world’s fourteen 8,000-meter peaks, without the aid of bottled oxygen. But No Shortcuts to the Top is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, “Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.” It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs’s odyssey, No Shortcuts to the Top is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.",0767924703,9780767924702),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Sometimes the adventure chooses you.Lover of fine poetry and lousy choose-your-own-adventure novels, Professor Sebastian Swift was once the bad-boy darling of the literati. The only lines he does these days are Browning, Frost, and Cummings. Even his relationship with the hot, handsome Wolfe Neck Police chief, Max Prescott, is healthy.When one of his most talented students comes to him bruised and begging for help, Swift hands over the keys to his Orson Island cabin - only to find out that the boy's father is dead and the police are suspicious. In an instant, the stable life Swift has built for himself hangs on finding the boy and convincing him to give himself up before Max figures out Swift's involvement in the case.Max enjoys splitting an infinitive or two with his favorite nutty professor, but he's not much for sonnets or Shakespeare. He likes being lied to even less. Yet his instincts - and his heart - tell him his lover is being played. Max can forgive lies and deception, but a dangerous enemy may not stop until Swift is heading up his own dead poet's society.Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that Josh Lanyon's smart, sexy, sophisticated stories may prove hazardous to your heart.",1609282736,9781609282738),ebook,1st Edition,161 pages,"

","A massive terrorist attack on Arsenal's new stadium - a woman grieving for her husband and son - a unique, twisted powerhouse of a novel.Angry, funny, heart-rending and subversive, few first novels are as compelling as this one. From the first sentence of her open letter to Osama Bin Laden, Incendiary's unforgettable narrator won't let you go, and her cry of raw outrage at the murder of her family rapidly develops into something very unexpected. Part thriller, part satire, part memorial to a dead child, it shows us an East End woman trying every way she can to climb out of despair, and a society in the grip of fear and self-interest. It is a story in which everyone is compromised - where personal betrayals reflect national ones, and Britain's class system is a ticking bomb.Shocking but tender, brutal yet hopeful, Incendiary forces us to see what we'd rather not see, yet never fails to entertain. The writing moves from horror to humour with terrifying ease. The power of the storytelling is mesmerising. Few writers have pinned a generation down on the mat like this and refused to allow it up till it admits it's rotten.",0701179058,9780701179052),Paperback,,243 pages,"

","New York. 2120. American has been decimated, wiped out from the second Civil War. In this post-apocalyptic world, survivors are far and few between. And most of those who do survive are members of the violent gangs, predators who live in the big cities. They patrol the countryside looking for slaves, for fresh victims to bring back into the city for their favorite death sport: Arena One. The death stadium where opponents are made to fight to the death, in the most barbaric of ways. There is only one rule to the arena: no one survives. Ever. Deep in the wilderness, high up in the Catskill Mountains, 17 year old Brooke Moore manages to survive, hiding out with her younger sister, Bree. They are careful to avoid the gangs of slaverunners who patrol the countryside. But one day, Brooke is not as careful as she can be, and Bree is captured. The slaverunners take her away, heading to the city, and to what will be a certain death. Brooke, a Marine’s daughter, was raised to be tough, to never back down from a fight. When her sister is taken, Brooke mobilizes, uses everything at her disposal to chase down the slaverunners and get her sister back. Along the way she runs into Ben, 17, another survivor like her, whose brother was taken. Together, they team up on their rescue mission. What follows is a post-apocalyptic, action-packed thriller, as the two of them pursue the slaverunners on the most dangerous ride of their lives, following them deep into the heart of New York. Along the way, if they are to survive, they will have to make some of the hardest choices and sacrifices of their lives, encountering obstacles neither of them had expected—including their unexpected feelings for each other. Will they rescue their siblings? Will they make it back? And will they, themselves, have to fight in the arena?",0984975314,9780984975310),Paperback,,300 pages,"

","W książce tej jest wszystko, czego można chcieć się dowiedzieć o życiu w socjalizmie. Oczywiście życiu inteligenta. A szczególnie inteligenta warszawiaka.Na kartach Dziennika 1954 spotkamy Herberta, Jasienicę, Kisiela, Turowicza, by wspomnieć tylko tych, których wspominać warto. Poznajemy też prozę i poezję bytowania młodego pisarza, świetnego obserwatora, znakomitego stylisty, którego wkrótce pozbyto się z Polski na stałe. Sam Tyrmand pisze o dzienniku tak: ""Tak, chodzi o świadectwo dla samego siebie, o wystawienie świadectwa memu życiu, moim pragnieniom i myślom, mojej epoce, z którą jestem związany nieskończonością węzłów. Ma to być świadectwo z pierwszej ręki, złożone przez stosunkowo najlepiej zorientowanego w danej sprawie świadka. Ale – częściowo nie. Tak silnie pożądam sprawdzenia samego siebie, mych słuszności i niesłuszności, mych możliwości i zdolności, a więc tego, czego tak uparcie odmawia mi moja aktualna sytuacja. Nie mam talentu kontemplacji ani daru tworzenia w imię samego aktu tworzenia. Jak powiedział mi ostatnio Kisiel, noszę w sobie wielką potrzebę i umiejętność dzielenia się z ludźmi moją wewnętrzną pracą myśli. Z najgłębszego powołania czuję się dziennikarzem, stąd konstrukcje mych przemyśleń ulegają dezaktualizacji, ponadto nie wierzę w możliwość własnego wysiłku nad kompozycją dzieła sztuki nieprzeznaczonego dla kogoś konkretnego w czasie i przestrzeni. Dlatego zdecydowałem, że dziennik przyniesie mi ulgę.""",8361297057,9788361297055),Paperback,,368 pages,"

Her surprise visit to her family doesn’t go as smoothly as she hopes when she brings home her new boyfriend, Zach, Black Falcon’s lead guitarist. She soon discovers that father doesn’t always know best when it comes to matters of the heart. When Zach meets Aubrey’s family, he’s immediately faced with his deepest fear: The love he so desperately wants, he doesn’t deserve. The Judge makes no attempt to hide his disdain for Zach, and will stop at nothing to keep him away from his daughter. But an unexpected twist turns everyone’s plans upside down and no one’s world will ever be the same. Outside forces attempting to pull them apart are strong and it’s going to take every bit of Zach and Aubrey’s love for one another to withstand the fall-out. Soon, they discover making love last is harder than finding it to begin with and sometimes you pay the ultimate price for true love. ***Note from author: This novella follows Riff and Aubrey's story from ROCK MY BED.***",English,English,Kindle Edition,,123 pages,"

They stay in your mind's eye until death.""For thirteen days in April 1994, Reverien Rurangwa hid in silence with his family in a tiny cabin on the side of a mountain until they were finally hunted down by their Hutu neighbors--men with whom his father had often drunk a beer after work. In minutes, forty-three members of his family were massacred in front of his eyes. Although part of his hand was cut off, Rurangwa managed to escape before the assassins set fire to the building.Rurangwa was fifteen and alone in the world; his only souvenir of his childhood was a battered family photograph. He tried to return to his home but was once again forced to flee in fear of his life. In this extraordinary memoir of survival, Rurangwa recounts how he struggled to come to terms with extreme loss, physical deformity, and a life in exile.Published to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the genocide, ""My Stolen Rwanda"" is tender and intimate. Rurangwa's story jumps from the pages with energy and even humor.Part of the proceeds from the sale of ""My Stolen Rwanda"" will go to Ibuka--Memory and Justice, which supports victims of the genocide.

When her husband hears God's call to become a preacher, Rachel Jackson Adams is distressed -- she grew up a preacher's daughter, and knows how difficult life under the microscope can be for a reverend's family. But hot-headed Rachel has toned down her wild ways, and for the sake of her marriage and her two children, she is now the reluctant first lady of Zion Hill, unafraid to rock the boat with her unconventional ideas for revitalizing the church. When her son, Jordan, begins fighting at school, Rachel turns to the boy's father, Bobby -- Rachel's first love from years ago. Married now himself, there should be nothing between them except their concern for Jordan -- so why does seeing Bobby again feel so distractingly tempting? With her brothers facing dramas of their own, and her father, Reverend Simon Jackson, recovering from illness, Rachel must listen carefully to discover what God truly wants for her -- and to decide if Bobby is the lover of her dreams or the devil in disguise",1416521658,9781416521655),Paperback,,283 pages,"

","The inside story of the one of the most successful British stand-up comedians, as told by the person best qualified to reveal all about the man behind the comic, his wife of over 20 years – Pamela Stephenson.Once in a lifetime, there strides upon the stage someone who can truly be called a legend. Such a person is the inimitable, timeless genius who is Billy Connolly. His effortlessly wicked whimsy has entranced, enthralled – and split the sides of – thousands upon thousands of adoring audiences.And when he isn't doing that…he's turning in award-winning performances on film and television.He's the man who needs no introduction, and yet he is the ultimate enigma. From a troubled and desperately poor childhood in the docklands of Glasgow he is now the intimate of household names the world over.How did this happen, who is the real Billy Connolly? Only one person can answer that question: his wife, Pamela Stephenson. Pamela’s writing combines the very personal with a frank objectivity that makes for a compelling, moving and hugely entertaining biography. This is the real Billy Connolly.This genre-defining book is now re-released for a new generation of comedy fans, with a stunning package and a new Foreword from the author. Pamela’s vision of Billy is as true now as it ever was – as groundbreaking, as moving and as laugh-out-loud funny – and here she brings the book fully into its context, as one of the most influential biographies ever written.",0007110928,9780007110926),Paperback,,384 pages,"

",All current and future gun control advocates should have this book in their book library. This book can be utilized as an effective training tool for Second Amendment debate with pro-gun facets of society. Byron Goines explains the insurrectionist interpretation of the Second Amendment that has been utilized for years by pro-gun facets of society to deceive Americans. The Constitution of the United States of America is clearly against insurrections yet pro-gun facets of society continue to deceive Americans by saying the Second Amendment gives them the right to bear arms in order to rise up against a tyrannical government which is clearly an insurrection. Bearing arms against the United States government is an insurrection and rebellion against the United States and the Constitution specifically addresses insurrections in detail and is totally against insurrections throughout. Byron Goines explains insurrections and how they are addressed as treason in the Constitution of the United States of America along with the Constitutional penalty for elected representatives who engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Learn what the Constitution says about insurrections as Byron Goines gives a Constitutional exegesis debunking the deceptive insurrectionist Second Amendment interpretation given by pro-gun facets of society.,English,English,Audiobook,,9 pages,"

","Regeane is a fatherless royal relation who happens to be a werewolf. Her guardian, Gundabald, and his venal son Hugo plan to recoup their fortunes by marrying Regeane to a wealthy bridegroom, even though she might inadvertently make him into a bedtime snack. Gundabald forces her into apparent compliance by threatening to reveal her secret to the Church, which would burn her at the stake. As the bridegroom, Maeniel, journeys to Rome to claim her, Regeane discovers allies in her quest to defeat Gundabald's machinations, including some very strong, funny, and levelheaded women. Unfortunately for Regeane, she also has more powerful enemies than Gundabald.  Alice Borchardt brings 8th-century Rome vividly to life. Her language is earthy and sensuously descriptive: ""The wolf visited Regeane's eyes and ears. The girl staggered slightly with the shock. The light in the square became intense. Smells an overwhelming experience: wet stone, damp air, musty clothing, perspirations shading from ancient sticky filth to fresh acrid adrenal alarm.""	  Borchardt is Anne Rice's sister, but she writes a very different sort of tale. Ghosts, the dead, and supernatural forces are here, but so is laugh-out-loud humor and a happy ending. --Nona Vero",0006483852,9780006483854),Paperback,,460 pages,"

","بِريود كلمة إنجليزية تعني فترة زمنية. والكلمة لها أصل يوناني من كلمة ""بِريودوس"" وتعني الزمن. وفي علم اللغويات Linguistics كلمة ""بِريود"" تعني النقطة التي توضع في آخر الجملة لتدل على نهايتها. أما في العصر الحديث فقد صارت الكلمة تُشير إلى الدورة الشهرية، والتي تُعَد من أكبر التابوهات في عالم النساء. وكعادتنا حين نود إضفاء شيء من التقبُّل إلى غير المُتقبَّل دخلت كلمة ""بِريود"" إلى عالمنا الناطق بالعربية لوصف تلك الأيام. وفي الحضارات القديمة لم تكن الدورة الشهرية من الأسرار، بل كانت واضحة للجميع كجزء أساسي من أنوثة المرأة التي ارتفعت إلى منصب الإلهة، وحكمت البلدان، واستحوذت على مكانة شديدة العلو كساحرة أو حكيمة أو عرَّافة. أما أيام النزيف في الدورة الشهرية فكانت فترة مُقدَّسة sacred time أحيطت بهالة من الإجلال، كهِبة أو مِنحة من الطبيعة أو من الآلهة للمرأة، تتسم بنشاط رُوحاني وقدرة عالية على التواصل مع الطبيعة أو الآلهة. وكان يصحب بلوغ الفتاة ونزول أول قطرات من دمائها الكثير من الاحتفالات لوصولها إلى هذه المرحلة المتطورة من الحياة.ثم جاءت الأديان السماوية تحمل فكرة الإله الواحد الذكر ذي السُّلطة الأبوية المطلقة، وحرمت المرأة من ذلك التقديس لطبيعتها كأنثى. فالله مذكر، فالأنبياء والرُّسل والعلماء والمفسرون رجال، والمرأة لا تصلح لهذه الأعمال، فهي الأضعف جسمانيًّا، وهي العاطفية متقلِّبة المزاج المفتقدة للعقلانية، وهي مصدر الفتنة للرِّجال، فهي الزانية إذا فاح عطرها أو بدت زينتها للعالم، وهي التي خُلِقَت من ضلع أعوج وحملت عبء الخطيئة الأولى فتعاونت مع الشيطان على غواية آدم ليأكل من الشجرة المحرمة ويطرد من الجنة، فكان أكثر اهل النار من النساء. ثم اضافت الأديان السماوية أعباءا نفسية إلى أيام النزيف، وكأن عبء الألم الشديد لا يكفي فتم إلصاق تهمة النجاسة إلى المرأة في هذه الأيام، وتم فرض عزلة دينية واجتماعية أضافت إلى العزلة النفسية والإحساس بالخجل والقذارة آلاما تفوق ألم النزيف. ثم انتقلت الفكرة في سلاسة شديدة إلى مجتمعاتنا الذكورية التي تمجد الخجل في النساء وتنتقده في الرجال. أصبحت تلك الفترة تابوه ليس من الممكن الاقتراب منه، فيجب أن تخفيه البنت عن أبيها وأخيها بل وقد تخفيه عن زوجها إذا أمكن. فتم فرض ذلك الحصار التاريخي على هذه الأيام لتتألم المرأة في صمت. ولكن صمت المرأة يتحول إلى صخب داخلي يختفي عن أسماع لعالم ويدوي فقط في جنبات النفس ليصبح صمتا أنثويا صاخبا لا يسمعه الرجال.في هذه المجموعة تخلَّيت عن كل ما يميز الرجال واقتربت في حذر من ذلك العالم الخفي الغامض، واستمعت واستمتعت بهذا الصخب، فكان يجب أن أشارك العالم شيئًا منه.محمد متولي",,9780006483854),,,97 pages,"

She quickly finds herself drawn into the saga of a people determined to rise from the ashes of war and sanctions and rebuild their lives in the face of crushing chaos.

","Distinguished British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) set off a series of movements that drastically altered the ways in which economists view the world. In his most important work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), Keynes critiqued the laissez-faire policies of his day, particularly the proposition that a normally functioning market economy would bring full employment. Keynes's forward-looking work transformed economics from merely a descriptive and analytic discipline into one that is policy oriented. For Keynes, enlightened government intervention in a nation's economic life was essential to curbing what he saw as the inherent inequalities and instabilities of unregulated capitalism.",1573921394,9781573921398),Paperback,,403 pages,"

Instead, she married and had a son, Jason, who—like David and Diana’s father—is schizophrenic. Her husband, Mark, a geneticist, never made peace with Jason’s condition.  Perhaps this is why, when Jason drowns, Diana will not accept the authorities’ conclusion that his death was accidental. Or perhaps Diana is going mad. She begins to send David faxes and e-mails about ancient murders, driven by her growing belief that the earth is Gaia, a living witness to her son’s murder who could give evidence in the case she is building against her husband. David soon fears for his own family’s safety as the seductive qualities of Diana’s manic energy become impossible to ignore.  In The Cloud of Unknowing, Cook explores the power of blood and family mythology.",0151012601,9780151012602),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

Mencintai bukan berarti juga bersedia jadi kekasih. Bagi Alita, orang tak pernah butuh syarat apa pun untuk jatuh cinta, tapi jelas banyak yang harus dipertimbangkan saat sepasang insan berniat menjalin hubungan serius.

Bagi Alita ini bukan pemberontakan melawan keluarga dan sahabatnya, sebab Alita merasa cintanya pada Erwin adalah jenis cinta sepihak yang tak menghendaki apa-apa dari yang dicintai.

","It's 1986. Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Molly Ringwald is on the cover of Time and 29-year-old Michael Gregoretti is a struggling, underpaid copywriter at a big New York ad agency. He'd rather be writing plays; instead, he's writing awful commercials for a moisturizer formulated to conquer that dire, life-threatening condition: handruff.Michael reluctantly accepts an assignment on a brand-new (and very secret) product – an aerosol butter – hoping it will lead to the kind of work that will land him a better job at another agency. But there's a catch: Working on this new account will also mean working for the rigid, compulsive and quite possibly insane Gwen Hammond, who thinks that Michael, with his off-the-wall ideas and unconventional campaigns, is just too much of a rebel to work with such a conservative client.To further complicate life, Michael meets and falls for Craig Connolly, an absolute dreamboat from the South with a voice like FM radio and a face to match. Craig claims he'd like to be in a relationship and Michael wants to believe it. The problem is, Craig is already married – to his job.Michael survives it all with the help of his two best friends: Irene Lucca, a witty book editor with a flair for vintage clothing and an eye for the art director Michael works with, and Anthony DeLorenzo, Michael's wise (and wisecracking) roommate and staunchest supporter.By the time A Fool Among Fools ends, Michael has battled stuffy clients and stifling supervisors, written and produced what just might be the worst commercials in the history of advertising, found and lost love, and managed to keep himself – and the reader – laughing along the way.",English,English,ebook,,375 pages,"

","Stephen Hawking has dazzled readers worldwide with a string of bestsellers exploring the mysteries of the universe. Now, for the first time, perhaps the most brilliant cosmologist of our age turns his gaze inward for a revealing look at his own life and intellectual evolution.My Brief History recounts Stephen Hawking’s improbable journey, from his postwar London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity. Lavishly illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty, and candid account introduces readers to a Hawking rarely glimpsed in previous books: the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him Einstein; the jokester who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a particular black hole; and the young husband and father struggling to gain a foothold in the world of physics and cosmology.Writing with characteristic humility and humor, Hawking opens up about the challenges that confronted him following his diagnosis of ALS at age twenty-one. Tracing his development as a thinker, he explains how the prospect of an early death urged him onward through numerous intellectual breakthroughs, and talks about the genesis of his masterpiece A Brief History of Time—one of the iconic books of the twentieth century.Clear-eyed, intimate, and wise, My Brief History opens a window for the rest of us into Hawking’s personal cosmos.",0345535286,9780345535283),Hardcover,,126 pages,"

","Following a near-fatal accident, Mark Schluter is nursed by his reluctant sister. But when he emerges from his coma, Mark believes that this woman – who looks, acts, and sounds just like his sister – is really an identical impostor. As a famous neurologist investigates his condition, Mark tries to learn what really happened the night of his accident.On a winter night on a remote Nebraska road, 27-year-old Mark Schluter flips his truck in a near-fatal accident. His older sister Karin, his only near kin, returns reluctantly to their hometown to nurse Mark back from a traumatic head injury. But when he emerges from a protracted coma, Mark believes that this woman – who looks, acts, and sounds just like his sister – is really an identical impostor. Shattered by her brother’s refusal to recognize her, Karin contacts the cognitive neurologist Gerald Weber, famous for his case histories describing the infinitely bizarre worlds of brain disorder. Weber recognizes Mark as a rare case of Capgras Syndrome, a doubling delusion, and eagerly investigates. What he discovers in Mark slowly undermines even his own sense of being. Meanwhile, Mark, armed only with a note left by an anonymous witness, attempts to learn what happened the night of his inexplicable accident. The truth of that evening will change the lives of all three beyond recognition. Set against the Platte River’s massive spring migrations – one of the greatest spectacles in nature – The Echo Maker is a gripping mystery that explores the improvised human self and the even more precarious brain that splits us from and joins us to the rest of creation.",0374146357,9780374146351),Hardcover,,451 pages,"

Alain Badiou proposes a vision of love as an adventure of the individual.Liberal and libertine reductions of love to instant pleasure and non-commitment bite the dust as Badiou invokes a supporting cast of thinkers from Plato to Lacan via Karl Marx to create a new narrative of romance, relationships and sex - one that does not fear love.",1846687799,9781846687792),Paperback,,104 pages,"

Dr. Michael Newton, a hypnotherapist in private practice, has developed his own hypnosis technique to reach his subjects' hidden memories of the hereafter. The resulting narrative acts as a progressive ""travel log"" of the accounts of twenty-nine people who were placed in a state of superconsciousness. While in deep hypnosis, these subjects movingly describe what has happened to them between their former reincarnations on earth. They reveal graphic details about how it feels to die, who meets us right after death, what the spirit world is really like, where we go and what we do as souls, and why we choose to come back in certain bodies.",1567184855,9781567184853),Paperback,,278 pages,"

","Combining the best of fantasy traditions with her own unique vision, Sarah Ash brings to dazzling life a new saga filled with epic adventure and unforgettable characters. Far-reaching in scope and imagination, Lord of Snow and Shadows embarks on a journey like no other—into a shape-shifting world teeming with political intrigue, astonishing magic, and passions both dark and light.Raised by his protective mother in the sunny clime of the south, Gavril Andar knows nothing of his father—or the ominous legacy that awaits him. But his innocence is about to be shattered. The man who ruled the wintry kingdom of Azhkendir, a man infused with the burning blood of the dragon-warrior known as Drakhaoul, has been murdered by his enemies. It is his fiery, chameleonlike blood that pulses through Gavril’s veins. The news is Gavril’s first taste of death—but it will not be his last. For blood is the liquid that seals his fate.Expected by clan warriors from the north to avenge his father’s murder—and still his unquiet ghost—Gavril is kidnapped. He soon learns that becoming Drakhaon means not only ascending to the throne of Azhkendir but changing, in subtle ways at first, into a being of extraordinary power and might. A being that must be replenished with the blood of innocents in order to survive. Ensconced in Kastel Drakhaon with no means of escape from the icebound kingdom, and carefully watched by neighboring rulers waiting to move against him, the untested Gavril must fight to retain his human heart and soul in the face of impending war—and the dark instincts that threaten to overpower him.Man and beast, spymaster and insurgent, nature and the netherworld--all collide in phenomenal twists and turns. A masterwork of adventure fantasy, Lord of Snow and Shadows will leave you stunned—and longing for more.",0553586211,9780553586213),Paperback,,574 pages,"

","Purification is one of the prominent features of Islam. It means thorough purity and cleanliness of body, clothes, place and all aspects of Muslim's life. ‘Book of Purification’ contains information on purity of water, types of impurities, ways of purification, Menstruation, Ghusl, Tayammum, Wudu etc. It is part of the “Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence Concerning Muslim Women” series written by Yusuf Al-Hajj Ahmad. This series addresses those matters of life and religion that are essential in facilitating a woman’s role as a mother, teacher and nurturer. Men can also read and benefit from this particular book because the information in this book is relevant to both males and females. It has two very important and distinct qualities: 1.	Easy to read, succinct and direct. 2.	The 'question and answer' layout of the book is intended to facilitate effortless comprehensibility and swift memorization. It is in view of the 'questions and answers' format that the author has concluded this book to be easy to read and comprehensive, hoping that it will enable the Muslims to be well informed about matters concerning their religion which will in turn strengthen their faith.",English,English,ebook,,115 pages,"

","Shipwrecked and cast ashore in Japan with no memory of Temeraire or his own experiences as an English aviator, Laurence finds himself tangled in deadly political intrigues that threaten not only his own life but England’s already precarious position in the Far East. Age-old enmities and suspicions have turned the entire region into a powder keg ready to erupt at the slightest spark—a spark that Laurence and Temeraire may unwittingly provide, leaving Britain faced with new enemies just when they most desperately need allies instead.For to the west, another, wider conflagration looms. Napoleon has turned on his former ally, the emperor Alexander of Russia, and is even now leading the largest army the world has ever seen to add that country to his list of conquests. It is there, outside the gates of Moscow, that a reunited Laurence and Temeraire—along with some unexpected allies and old friends—will face their ultimate challenge...and learn whether or not there are stronger ties than memory.Naomi Novik’s beloved Temeraire series, a brilliant combination of fantasy and history that reimagines the Napoleonic wars as fought with the aid of intelligent dragons, is a twenty-first-century classic. From the first volume, His Majesty’s Dragon, readers have been entranced by the globe-spanning adventures of the resolute Capt. William Laurence and his brave but impulsive dragon, Temeraire.

","From the award-winning author of Hotel World and The Accidental, a dazzling, funny, and wonderfully exhilarating new novel. At a dinner party in the posh London suburb of Greenwich, Miles Garth suddenly leaves the table midway through the meal, locks himself in an upstairs room, and refuses to leave. An eclectic group of neighbors and friends slowly gathers around the house, and Miles’s story is told from the points of view of four of them: Anna, a woman in her forties; Mark, a man in his sixties; May, a woman in her eighties; and a ten-year-old named Brooke. The thing is, none of these people knows Miles more than slightly. How much is it possible for us to know about a stranger? And what are the consequences of even the most casual, fleeting moments we share every day with one another? Brilliantly audacious, disarmingly playful, and full of Smith’s trademark wit and puns, There but for the is a deft exploration of the human need for separation—from our pasts and from one another—and the redemptive possibilities for connection. It is a tour de force by one of our finest writers.",0375424091,9780375424090),Hardcover,,236 pages,"

","Long ago, in the Second Age of history, a young Nain explorer by the name of Ven Polypheme traveled much of the known and unknown world, recording his adventures. Recently discovered by archaeologists, a few fragments of his original journals are reproduced in this book. Great care has been taken to reconstruct the parts of the journal that did not survive, so that a whole story can be told...Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme--known as Ven--is the youngest son of a long line of famous shipwrights. He dreams not of building ships, but of sailing them to far-off lands where magic thrives. Ven gets his chance when he is chosen to direct the Inspection of his family's latest ship--and sets sail on the journey of a lifetime. Attacked by fire pirates, lost at sea and near death, Ven is rescued by a passing ship on its way to the Island of Serendair. Thankful to be alive, little does Ven know that the pirate attack--and his subsequent rescue--may not have been an accident. Shadowy figures are hunting for the famed Floating Island, the only source of the mystical Water of Life. They think Ven can lead them to this treasure, and will stop at nothing to get it--even murder. In a narrative that alternates entries from his journals and drawings from his sketchbooks, Ven begins the famous chronicles of his exciting and exotic adventures--adventures that would later earn him renown as the author of The Book of All Human Knowledge and All the World's Magic.

The incredible story of the young women of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, who unwittingly played a crucial role in one of the most significant moments in U.S. history.
The Tennessee town of Oak Ridge was created from scratch in 1942. One of the Manhattan Project’s secret cities, it didn’t appear on any maps until 1949, and yet at the height of World War II it was using more electricity than New York City and was home to more than 75,000 people, many of them young women recruited from small towns across the South. Their jobs were shrouded in mystery, but they were buoyed by a sense of shared purpose, close friendships—and a surplus of handsome scientists and Army men!But against this vibrant wartime backdrop, a darker story was unfolding. The penalty for talking about their work—even the most innocuous details—was job loss and eviction. One woman was recruited to spy on her coworkers. They all knew something big was happening at Oak Ridge, but few could piece together the true nature of their work until the bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and the secret was out. The shocking revelation: the residents of Oak Ridge were enriching uranium for the atomic bomb.Though the young women originally believed they would leave Oak Ridge after the war, many met husbands there, made lifelong friends, and still call the seventy-year-old town home. The reverberations from their work there—work they didn’t fully understand at the time—are still being felt today. In The Girls of Atomic City, Denise Kiernan traces the astonishing story of these unsung WWII workers through interviews with dozens of surviving women and other Oak Ridge residents. Like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, this is history and science made fresh and vibrant—a beautifully told, deeply researched story that unfolds in a suspenseful and exciting way.",1451617526,9781451617528),Hardcover,,373 pages,"

","Chinon-chateau of legend, steeped in the history of France and England. It is to Chinon that Emily goes on a long-awaited holiday, to meet her charming but unreliable cousin, Harry. Harry wanted to explore the old town and the castle, where Queen Isabelle, child bride of King John, had withstood the siege of Chinon many centuries ago, and where, according to legend, she hid her casket of jewels. But when Emily arrives at her hotel she finds that Harry has disappeared, and as she tries to find him she becomes involved with some of the other guests and learns of a mystery dating from the German occupation during the Second World War. Another Isabelle, a chambermaid at the hotel, fell in love with a German soldier, with tragic results.Emily becomes increasingly aware of strange tensions, old enmities and new loves; as she explores the city, with its labyrinthine dungeons and tunnels and its ancient secrets, she comes ever closer to the mystery of what happened to both the Isabelles of Chinon's history.",0770427189,9780770427184),Mass Market Paperback,,380 pages,"

","In this meticulously researched and masterfully written book, Pulitzer Prize-winner Deborah Blum examines the history of love through the lens of its strangest unsung hero: a brilliant, fearless, alcoholic psychologist named Harry Frederick Harlow. Pursuing the idea that human affection could be understood, studied, even measured, Harlow (1905-1981) arrived at his conclusions by conducting research-sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrible-on the primates in his University of Wisconsin laboratory. Paradoxically, his darkest experiments may have the brightest legacy, for by studying ""neglect"" and its life-altering consequences, Harlow confirmed love's central role in shaping not only how we feel but also how we think. His work sparked a psychological revolution. The more children experience affection, he discovered, the more curious they become about the world: Love makes people smarter. The biography of both a man and an idea, The Measure of Love is a powerful and at times disturbing narrative that will forever alter our understanding of human relationships.",0738202789,9780738202785),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

From a master class in ""The Impunity of Power"" to a seminar on ""The Sacred Car""—with tips along the way on ""How to Resist Useless Vices"" and a declaration of the ""The Right to Rave""—he surveys a world unevenly divided between abundance and deprivation, carnival and torture, power and helplessness.We have accepted a ""reality"" we should reject, he writes, one where poverty kills, people are hungry, machines are more precious than humans, and children work from dark to dark. In the North, we are fed on a diet of artificial need and all made the same by things we own; the South is the galley slave enabling our greed.",0312420315,9780312420314),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","*****#1 Bestseller in Amazon Inspirational Romance*****""As long as you continue to travel through life in this darkness, you will never know how beautiful your light truly shines when you let yourself love and be loved. Trust me when I say, it's a breathtaking sight to see. You burn as bright as the sun.""When Aubrey Miller begins her education at Titan University, she is no longer the beautiful, blonde-haired, blue-eyed girl of her youth. In fact, she's no longer even Aubrey Miller. Overcome with guilt and unable to cope with the loss of her beloved family, she has long since buried eight-year old Aubrey along with them and transformed herself into Raven Miller. Now with jet-black hair, multiple sets of eccentric contact lenses, and several facial piercings, she's veiled herself in complete darkness as a form of protection for herself, as well as others. As she enters her first year of college, her goal is simple: Earn a degree with the least amount of social interaction as possible. What she never anticipates is the formation of very unlikely relationships with two people who will change her life in ways she never believed possible: Quinn Matthews, the overtly cheerful pageant queen, and Kaeleb McMadden, a childhood friend who never really let her go. Over the years, as their connections intertwine and strengthen, a seemingly indestructible bond is formed between the three. And eventually, the ties of friendship and discovery of first love begin to coax her from her darkened path as they slowly bring Aubrey back to life. But when faced with the possibility of yet another death, one from which she may never recover, Aubrey finds herself lost again, burying herself deeper than ever before beneath the familiar abyss of her fears. Spanning the course of four years, this is the story of a young woman's plight to finally reemerge, finding strength within unbreakable bonds as she delivers herself from her own manufactured darkness and safely back . . .

","Vincent Spinetti is an archetypal tortured artist ? a sensitive young writer who falls victim to alienation, parental neglect, poverty, depression, alcoholism, illness, nervous breakdowns, and unrequited love. He is painfully unaware that these torments are due to the secret manipulations of New Renaissance, an experimental organization that is testing the age-old idea that art results from suffering. Since culture is so significantly influenced by music, movies, and television, New Renaissance hopes to improve the mindless mainstream by raising writers who emphasize artistic quality over commerce. As part of its top-secret sub-project, New Renaissance hires reluctant ex-musician Harlan Eiffler to manipulate its most promising prodigy, Vincent. Wickedly antisocial and deeply disgusted by what passes for entertainment in the twenty-first century, Harlan clandestinely pulls the strings so that Vincent remains a true artist. All the while, he poses as Vincent's manager, simultaneously nurturing his prolific career and torturing his soul.",159692148X,9781596921481),Paperback,,265 pages,"

","Once rumored to have been the inspiration for Ian Fleming's Miss Moneypenny, Vera Atkins climbed her way to the top in the Special Operations Executive, or SOE: Britain's secret service created to help build up, organize, and arm the resistance in the Nazi-occupied countries. Throughout the war, Atkins recruited, trained, and mentored the agents for the SOE's French Section, which sent more than four hundred young men and women into occupied France, at least one hundred of whom never returned and were reported MPD (missing presumed dead) after the war. Twelve of these were women and among Atkins' most cherished spies. When the war ended in 1945, she made it her personal mission to find out what happened to them and the other agents lost behind enemy lines, tracing rigorously their horrific final journeys. But as the woman who carried out this astonishing search appeared quintessentially English, Atkins was nothing of the sort. As we follow her through the devastation of postwar Germany, we learn Atkins herself covered her life in mystery so that even her closest family knew almost nothing of her past.In A Life in Secrets Sarah Helm has stripped away Vera Atkins' many veils. Drawing on recently released sixty-year-old government files and her unprecedented access to the private papers of the Atkins family, Helm vividly reconstructs a complex and extraordinary life.",038550845X,9780385508452),Hardcover,,528 pages,"

His only hope of returning home rests on his best friend Riley who, on the eve of their escape, slipped into a coma. Despite staggering debt, vengeful mutants and bounty hunters, Liam continues a seemingly never-ending quest for a cure to end Riley's unnatural five-year sleep. Every night, Liam stares at the listless man who not only holds his escape, but his heart. The suffering can end, however; Liam must only forsake all hope of ever returning home again, abandon Riley to his fate, and wholeheartedly serve as a soldier for The Colony—the very people he's trying to escape.

","‘Dina Lal wasn’t moving . . . Hindu or not, he wasn’t, goddamnit, going anywhere.’ Lahore, 1947. Dina Lal, a true-blue Lahori, refuses to leave, staying put in Five Queen’s Road, a house he bought, in spite of his wife’s greatest misgivings, from an Englishman who was deeply reluctant to part with it. To insulate his family from the mayhem on the streets, Dina Lal converts to Islam and as added protection invites Amir Shah, a Muslim colleague, and his children, Javid and Rubina, to share the house with him. But the events that unfold over the next few months make a mockery of Dina Lal’s plans. While Dina Lal and Amir Shah cross swords with each other at every given opportunity—though unexpectedly and in spite of themselves rushing to the other’s defence in moments of crisis—a furtive friendship blossoms between Dina Lal and Javid. Ten years later Javid’s European wife, Irene, still struggling with her World War II memories, joins the tumultuous household. Inexplicably, the lines of the house are redrawn, and the new border is no less arbitrary and contentious than the one that sundered the subcontinent. While the house is steadily encroached upon by a car shop settlement and a sweepers’ colony, the occupants’ long-standing feud reaches new heights. But the family sees an unexpected alliance develop and loyalties, to person and nation, are scrutinized. In this stunning novel that weaves family saga and national history, Sorayya Khan writes deftly of characters who battle memories and each other alike.",English,English,Paperback,,224 pages,"

Tim hoped moving to Texas would mean a new beginning, a chance to spread his wings, but he soon finds himself falling into the same tired patterns. Until he meets recklessly brave Benjamin Bentley. Suddenly a whole new world opens up to Tim—love, sex, warmth… home. Certain that society won’t understand what he and Ben have together, Tim struggles to protect their relationship, even if it means twisting the truth. As his lies slowly push Ben away, Tim learns that the greatest enemy can come from within. Buried beneath a decade of deceptions, Tim must claw his way to the surface in the hopes of learning to fly.

She never thought that before rallying an empire, she'd have to fight the emperor himself.An imposter sits the throne and the court she turned to for help is in turmoil. Ciardis hasn't survived assassination attempts, torture and really bad luck to be taken down by her own ruler. So she devises a plan. But first she needs to get Sebastian and Thanar to agree. Each seems to love her in their own way. But neither is listening to her.

Hallie dreamed of escaping her hometown and never looking back. After putting herself through college, landing her dream job in Chicago, and starting a romance with her handsome running partner Bo Pompillio, life is finally exactly as she wants it. That is, until she’s transferred back to the hometown. Not wanting her past to cross paths with her future, Hallie puts her relationship with Bo on hold. When she arrives in town, Hallie finds crazy Aunt Grace rummaging through a dumpster looking for the “perfect” welcome home gift for her niece. That’s just the beginning.

Hallie finds some sanity at a local jewelry-making class where she uncovers a hidden talent for beading. When her talent is discovered by a major department store jewelry buyer, Hallie realizes that what she had in Chicago might not have been her dream life after all. When faced with the choice of moving back to Chicago and Bo or taking a leap of faith to start her own jewelry company (with Aunt Grace in tow), Hallie has to make a decision.

Her uncle, older brothers, and a few annoying angels dominate her life, demanding she tow their lines – and the punishment is severe when those lines are crossed. When Jordan is ordered to help hunt down a monster, she’s not sure which she dreads more: the elusive, blood-thirsty creature or spending time in a cramped backwoods cabin with a brother who despises her. To make matters worse, a demon shows up and warns Jordan that she could be her family’s next assignment.In a game between Good and Evil where God seems to have tapped out early, lines are blurred and not everything is as it seems. Jordan learns a little too late that the real monster is closer than she thinks.",B00GG52WRW,B00GG52WRW,Kindle Edition,Second Edition,264 pages,"

And while it’s not a fiery inferno, it’s certainly no heaven. It’s gray, ashen, and crumbling more and more by the day, and everyone has a job to do. Which doesn’t leave Velveteen much time to do anything about what’s really on her mind.Bonesaw.Velveteen aches to deliver the bloody punishment her killer deserves. And she’s figured out just how to do it. She’ll haunt him for the rest of his days. It’ll be brutal... and awesome.But crossing the divide between the living and the dead has devastating consequences. Velveteen’s obsessive haunting cracks the foundations of purgatory and jeopardizes her very soul.

Even though the relationship is clearly over, Melissa clings to the past, riding a never-ending wave of hope and disappointment. Meaningless sexual escapades, drunken nights, and drug-induced blackouts help her deal with heartbreak, but her pain goes much deeper than her failed relationship. Along with a broken heart, Melissa has to cope with the memories of her younger brother’s death; the non-existent parenting of her insecure, flighty mother; being juggled between social workers and psychologists; and getting kicked out of school and sent to a special program for at-risk youth. So when the cracks in her life threaten to tear her apart, Melissa has to decide whether to keep fighting—or to let go.",English,English,Paperback,,263 pages,"

","A new trilogy by best-selling author of Amish Christian Romances, Sarah Price, and Whoopie Pie Pam Jarrell. The first book immediately hit #1 in the Amish genre as well as an Amazon Top 100 within days.  In Book 2 of the series, readers will continue following the story of four Amish sisters who run Whoopie Pie Place, the best known bakery outside of Berlin, Ohio. Each sister has a secret that influences their lives and, unknowingly, impacts each other. Yet, little by little, the pressure of balancing their responsibilities of their daily lives with their individual secrets becomes harder to manage. Leah, Susan, Lydia, and Sadie need to decide whether or not to confide in each other in order to gain the support of their family. As secrets begin to be revealed, more problems ensue. Can Leah continue to hold the family together? Will Susie address her issues at home? Will Lydia admit what everyone else knows? How can Sadie maintain her balance when faced with life-changing decisions?  The Divine Secrets of the Whoopie Pie Sisters is a different type of Amish Christian story. By blending the 25 years experience of living among the Amish from Sarah Price with Pamela Jarrell's extensive 15 years experience interacting and befriending the Amish in Berlin, Ohio, Price and Jarrell team up to give the readers a new type of story that focuses not so much on romance but on friendships and the reality of day-to-day life living among the Amish.

","Dorothy Parker, master of the short story, dramatist, screenwriter, and sharp-tongued critic, was also an accomplished poet. At the center of the famed Round Table at New York's Algonquin Hotel, Parker distinguished herself among a circle of urbane literati with her excoriating quips and wonderfully realized epigrammatic poems. By the time her first collection of poems, Enough Rope, was published in 1926, she had been dubbed the ""wittiest woman in America"".Confronting the hard facts of existence facing a woman of talent and boldness in the 1920s and '30s, Parker's poems depict a world haunted by unrequited love, alcohol, razor blades, and men of overbearing will. Her poetry earned much admiration from critics such as Odgen Nash, Somerset Maugham, and Edmund Wilson, who hailed it as ""flatly brutal as the wit of the age of Pope"". Complete Poems collects Parker's three volumes of poetry, Enough Rope, Sunset Gun, and Death and Taxes, as well as a hundred other previously uncollected works -- such as the ""hate songs"", compact satiric descriptions of husbands and wives, actors and politicians, bores and ne'er-do-wells, and others who attracted her barbed pen.",0141180226,9780141180229),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A Creative Tension is a fresh look at the foreign policy roles of Congress and the president by one of the most astute congressional practitioners of foreign policy of recent decades, former U.S. representative and chairman of the House International Relations Committee Lee H. Hamilton. With an insider's perspective based on thirty-four years in Congress, Hamilton elucidates current domestic and international pressures influencing U.S. foreign policy, strengths and weaknesses in the foreign policy process, and ways to improve the performance of the president and Congress. A Creative Tension argues persuasively and elegantly that better consultation between the executive and legislative branches is the most effective way to strengthen American foreign policy.A Creative Tension is the most extensive analysis of the congressional and presidential roles in foreign policy by a former member of Congress. Hamilton explores the topic in an original, stimulating, and accessible manner by deftly mixing incisive commentary with illuminating personal reflections. The book includes timely and important recommendations for improving the ability of Congress and the president to develop a foreign policy that meets the challenges and opportunities of a post-September 11 world. It should be of interest to foreign policy makers, scholars and students of American politics, and the general public.Wilson Forum",1930365128,9781930365124),Paperback,,108 pages,"

",This may be the most brutal and controversial story that David Gerrold has ever written. An attempted gay-bashing of a crippled war vet leads to a scream-of-consciousness unraveling of a terrifying past and the ultimate discovery of a new human possibility. After its publication in the February 2006 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction several subscribers actually cancelled their subscriptions in protest. This story is an unflinching look at souls in transformation. Contains strong language and vivid descriptions of sex and violence. Not recommended for young or impressionable readers.

","In this frenetic collection of stories taken from the files of Nick Nightmare, Private Eye, the intrepid pulp hero is thrown into a murky world of crawling horrors, spawned by the Old Ones as they seek to rise up from their primordial oceanic depths, ‘when the stars are right.’ Whether he is shooting it out with power-crazed acolytes in his native New York, or slipping across into other dimensions to battle the spreading plague of invasion, Nightmare is never far from the long, clammy reach of the things from the Deep, bizarre artifacts of power, decrepit villages and citadels, magic and voodoo. Life for the private eye is an endless slalom of mayhem. Nick Nightmare Investigates includes a team-up with Damian Paladin in a brand new, full-blooded action thriller, written in collaboration with Mike Chinn.Nick Nightmare Investigates is a potent blend of HP Lovecraft, Mickey Spillane and the roller coaster adventures of the golden age of the pulps.",9780957348981,9780957348981,Hardcover,Signed and Limited edition (200 copies),264 pages,"

","Gabriela Pereira has spent the majority of her 27 years tending to her ailing mother, and in doing so has put most of her hopes, dreams and aspirations for the future on permanent hold. She is constantly tormented by the guilt of being the only one left to care for her mother, who has suffered through unimaginable trauma in the past - both emotional and physical. The possibility of finding love has also become a distant fantasy for Gabby, not likely to come true any time soon either, until she meets Benjamin Martin - a handsome, charismatic, intelligent, successful, funny, and so very tasty (quite literally and figuratively speaking) man - who owns the Caribbean restaurant next door to her office. He is the kind of guy that seems too good to be true. This sort of thing doesn't happen to her...Passion, lust, heartache and loss all collide into one mouth-watering read when a shy and lonely Brazilian-Canadian girl finds love in a handsome, charismatic Jamaican-Canadian chef among the diverse sights, sounds and food of Vancouver's eclectic Commercial Drive.

But when Maximillian Solomon asks him about The Temple of the Last Days he figures his luck might be about to change. In 1975 the cult led by its infamous leader Sister Katherine met a bloody end in the Arizona desert. The shoot’s locations take Kyle to the cult’s original bases in London, France and finally the crime scene where the cult met their bloody end. But when he interviews the remaining survivors of the Last Days who haven’t broken silence in decades, a series of uncanny events and unexplained phenomena plague the shoots. And what exactly is it they are managing to record in any place the Temple once resided? Troubling out-of-body experiences and nocturnal visitations, the sudden demise of their interviewees and the discovery of ghastly artefacts, soon pitch Kyle and his one-man crew, into the unnerving realisation that they have become entangled in the cult’s hideous legacy.",B007L23Z8E,B007L23Z8E,Kindle Edition,,542 pages,"

For the first time ever, an explosive inside look at modern military police units and their role in defending our freedomAmerica has been at war on several fronts since the 9/11 attack. While public attention has focused on Marines, conventional Army units, and Special Operations Forces, a lion’s share of the war-fighting has been done, under media radar, by Military Police units. These squad and platoon-sized units patrol dangerous urban streets, build up local police units to improve neighborhood stability, and conduct civic action missions. On many occasions they have rushed into a vicious firefight to come to the assistance of infantry units in desperate straits. They keep villages Taliban-free, monitor balloting sites, and interdict drug shipments. In detention centers at Camp Bucha, Iraq, Bagram, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, Cuba they guard some of the most dangerous terrorists in history.The story is told by the soldiers themselves, recounting what they have seen and experienced, along with historical context and first-hand field observations by the author team who were provided with unique inside access. Warrior Police takes readers into the bloody streets of Iraq, the dangerous back-country of Afghanistan, and wherever our Military Police are needed.

Without a formal accusation or trial, the onetime national hero was imprisoned on Buru for eleven years. He survived under brutal conditions, somehow managing to produce his masterwork, the four novels of the Buru Quartet, as well as the remarkable journal entries, essays, and Letters that comprise this moving memoir.Reminiscent of the work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Mute's Soliloquy is a harrowing portrait of a penal colony and a heartbreaking remembrance of life before it. With a resonance far beyond its particular time and place, it is Pramoedya's crowning achievement -- a passionate tribute to the freedom of the mind and a celebration of the human spirit.",0140289046,9780140289046),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","De zevenjarige Alice moet van haar vader elke dag tegen haar zin naar skiles. Op een mistige ochtend zondert zij zich af van haar skiklasje en besluit ze de afdaling alleen te maken, maar ze komt ten val en raakt voor de rest van haar leven verlamd aan een been. Mattia is de helft van een tweeling. Hij is hyperintelligent, zijn zusje Michela is zwakbegaafd. Als de tweeling wordt uitgenodigd voor een verjaardagspartijtje schaamt Mattia zich bij voorbaat voor het gedrag van Michela en hij besluit om haar op een bank in het park achter te laten met de opdracht dat ze daar op hem moet wachten. Als hij terugkomt is zijn zusje verdwenen en zij wordt nooit meer gevonden. Op de middelbare school kruisen de levens van Alice en Mattia elkaar en er ontstaat een merkwaardige vriendschap. Ze voelen zich vanaf de dag van hun ontmoeting verbonden, maar merken al snel hoe moeilijk het is om wezenlijk contact met elkaar te krijgen.",902343496X,9789023434962),Paperback,,318 pages,"

","For suspense-filled, post-apocalyptic thrillers, Wool is more than a self-published ebook phenomenon―it’s the new standard in classic science fiction.In a ruined and toxic future, a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them. Sheriff Holston, who has unwaveringly upheld the silo’s rules for years, unexpectedly breaks the greatest taboo of all: He asks to go outside.His fateful decision unleashes a drastic series of events. An unlikely candidate is appointed to replace him: Juliette, a mechanic with no training in law, whose special knack is fixing machines. Now Juliette is about to be entrusted with fixing her silo, and she will soon learn just how badly her world is broken. The silo is about to confront what its history has only hinted about and its inhabitants have never dared to whisper.

","As another college year draws to an end, Professor Michael Branden is weary after nearly thirty years of teaching. Sitting in his office on a warm spring day, he receives an unexpected visit from an Amish man who claims his brother, a dwarf like himself, has been murdered. Their discussion of the odd details of the case is interrupted by a commotion on campus, which turns out to be the apparent suicide of a young woman, who, it seems, has leapt to her death from the college bell tower.The investigations of these two deaths become intertwined as Professor Branden again teams up with his colleagues Pastor Cal Troyer and Sheriff Bruce Robertson to seek explanations for these bizarre events.Separate from the World is a story of a rift between two Amish factions, one that favors the use of medicine and that participates in a college study of genetic traits particular to the Amish community, and the other that rejects any outside influence.Once more, P. L. Gaus takes us inside a separate culture and, in a manner both gentle and grim, highlights the complex relationship of the Amish and the “English” as they live inside or outside each other’s orbits.",B006O524DQ,B006O524DQ,Audiobook,,,"

","From his first appearance on a Vatican balcony Pope Francis proved himself a Pope of Surprises. With a series of potent gestures, history’s first Jesuit pope declared a mission to restore authenticity and integrity to a Catholic Church bedevilled by sex abuse and secrecy, intrigue and in-fighting, ambition and arrogance. He declared it should be 'a poor Church, for the poor'.But there is a hidden past to this modest man with the winning smile. Jorge Mario Bergoglio was previously a bitterly divisive figure. His decade as leader of Argentina’s Jesuits left the religious order deeply split. And his behaviour during Argentina’s Dirty War, when military death squads snatched innocent people from the streets, raised serious questions – on which this book casts new light.Yet something dramatic then happened to Jorge Mario Bergoglio. He underwent an extraordinary transformation. After a time of exile he re-emerged having turned from a conservative authoritarian into a humble friend of the poor – and became Bishop of the Slums, making enemies among Argentina’s political classes in the process. For Pope Francis – Untying the Knots, Paul Vallely travelled to Argentina and Rome to meet Bergoglio’s intimates over the last four decades. His book charts a remarkable journey. It reveals what changed the man who was to become Pope Francis – from a reactionary into the revolutionary who is unnerving Rome’s clerical careerists with the extent of his behind-the-scenes changes. In this perceptive portrait Paul Vallely offers both new evidence and penetrating insights into the kind of pope Francis could become.",English,English,Paperback,,227 pages,"
