","Since its appearance in China in the third century, The Lotus Sutra has been regarded as one of the most illustrious scriptures in the Mahayana Buddhist canon. The object of intense veneration among generations of Buddhists in China, Korea, Japan, and other parts of the world, it has had a profound impact on the great works of Japanese and Chinese literature, attracting more commentary than any other Buddhist scripture.As Watson notes in the introduction to his remarkable translation, "" The Lotus Sutra is not so much an integral work as a collection of religious texts, an anthology of sermons, stories, and devotional manuals, some speaking with particular force to persons of one type or in one set of circumstances, some to those of another type or in other circumstances. This is no doubt why it has had such broad and lasting appeal over the ages and has permeated so deeply into the cultures that have been exposed to it.""",0231081618,9780231081610),Paperback,,390 pages,"

","Rick Kuhn’s Henryk Grossman and the Recovery of Marxism is the definitive study of the life and work of this renowned economist, activist, and intellectual. As a young man, Grossman joined the socialist movement and participated in Jewish workers' strikes and demonstrations, as well as in boycotts against employers and the Austro-Hungarian state. He moved to Vienna, but was driven back to Poland by the Austrian state's racist citizenship policies. A member of the illegal Polish Communist Party, Grossman was frequently arrested and jailed, finally leaving Poland for a post at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt am Main, which gave rise to the famous 'Frankfurt School'. Grossman published his best known work in Frankfurt, including studies of Marx's method in Capital and theories of economic crisis that remain influential today. In tracing Grossman's experiences, from Kraków to New York, and offering a detailed account of his ideas, the biography provides an intimate account of key events in twentieth century history, including the politicization of east European Jewry, the World Wars, the rise of Stalinism and Nazism, and the cold war.",0252073525,9780252073526),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","That last raise may be fattening your bank account, but it did nothing for your soul. The talk you had with your boss about your kids' schools, however, did. Although our culture is focused on achievement, it is not our accomplishments that sustain us. It is the connections we make along the way.  What are these connections? They are the feelings of being part of something that matters, something larger than ourselves, whether it is a friendship, marriage, team, company, or even a set of ideals. They can enrich your life, and their absence can shorten it. They are the key to what counts in life, and they are becoming harder and harder to make.  Now a noted psychiatrist outlines the steps we can take to make or reaffirm the connections that nourish the hungry heart. Through his own life experiences and those who have shared their stories with him, we learn of the great joy and peace that come from connecting, and the consequences of remaining detached. And we learn how to nurture that part of us which is so often neglected, and so very crucial to our emotional, psychological, and physical well-being -- our connections.",0743406214,9780743406215),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","When Legendary Negro League player Buck O'Neil asked sports columnist Joe Posnanski how he fell in love with baseball, Posnanski had to think about it. From that question was born the idea behind BASEBALL AND JAZZ. Posnanski and the 94 year old O'Neil decided to spend the 2005 baseball season touring the country in hopes of stirring up the love that first drew them to the game. This book is just as much the story of Buck O'Neil as it is the story of baseball. In a time when disillusioned, steroid–shooting, money hungry athletes define the sport, Buck O'Neil stands out as a man that truly played for the love of the game. Posnanski writes about that love and the one thing that O'Neil loved almost as much as baseball: jazz. BASEBALL AND JAZZ is an endearing step back in time to the days when the crack of a bat and the smoky notes of a midnight jam session were the sounds that brought the most joy to a man's heart.",0060854030,9780060854034),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","What is the process by which a painting comes into being? What goes on in the artist's mind? What different techniques are used in creating a still life, landscape, or portrait? In this look at the complex, often mysterious painting process, painter/museum director Thomas S. Buechner combines clear how-to instruction with striking insights to help us look at pictures in a wholly new way. An expert on painting techniques, Buechner offers valuable tips for both amateur and professional painters on traditional methods that many schools do not teach today. An impassioned painter himself, whose work hangs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art, Buechner includes illustrations of many of his most inspired paintings and drawings-some shown in step-by-step series with enlarged details-illuminating for us the intimate relationship between the artist and his materials. 129 illustrations, 98 in full color, 8 1/2 x 10 3/4"" THOMAS S. BUECHNER, former director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Corning Museum of Glass, is the author of several books, most notably Abrams' definitive biography Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator.

","""Reduce, reuse, recycle,"" urge environmentalists; in other words, do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative, visionary book, such an approach only perpetuates the one-way, ""cradle to grave"" manufacturing model, dating to the Industrial Revolution, that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world? In fact, why not take nature itself as our model for making things? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective.Waste equals food. Guided by this principle, McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that, after their useful lives, they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as ""biological nutrients"" that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be ""technical nutrients"" that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closed-loop industrial cycles, rather than being ""recycled"" -- really, downcycled -- into low-grade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting eco-effectiveness into practice, and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well.",0865475873,9780865475878),Paperback,,193 pages,"

","From the moment he was born, Andrew Bridge and his mother Hope shared a love so deep that it felt like nothing else mattered. Trapped in desperate poverty and confronted with unthinkable tragedies, all Andrew ever wanted was to be with his mom. But as her mental health steadily declined, and with no one else left to care for him, authorities arrived and tore Andrew from his screaming mother's arms. In that moment, the life he knew came crashing down around him. He was only seven years old. Hope was institutionalized, and Andrew was placed in what would be his devastating reality for the next eleven years--foster care. After surviving one of our country's most notorious children's facilities, Andrew was thrust into a savagely loveless foster family that refused to accept him as one of their own. Deprived of the nurturing he needed, Andrew clung to academics and the kindness of teachers. All the while, he refused to surrender the love he held for his mother in his heart. Ultimately, Andrew earned a scholarship to Wesleyan, went on to Harvard Law School, and became a Fulbright Scholar. Andrew has dedicated his life's work to helping children living in poverty and in the foster care system. He defied the staggering odds set against him, and here in this heartwrenching, brutally honest, and inspirational memoir, he reveals who Hope's boy really is.",1401303226,9781401303228),Hardcover,,306 pages,"

","In 1960 the government of Trinidad invited V. S. Naipaul to revisit his native country and record his impressions. In this classic of modern travel writing he has created a deft and remarkably prescient portrait of Trinidad and four adjacent Caribbean societies–countries haunted by the legacies of slavery and colonialism and so thoroughly defined by the norms of Empire that they can scarcely believe that the Empire is ending.In The Middle Passage, Naipaul watches a Trinidadian movie audience greeting Humphrey Bogart’s appearance with cries of “That is man!” He ventures into a Trinidad slum so insalubrious that the locals call it the Gaza Strip. He follows a racially charged election campaign in British Guiana (now Guyana) and marvels at the Gallic pretension of Martinique society, which maintains the fiction that its roads are extensions of France’s routes nationales. And throughout he relates the ghastly episodes of the region’s colonial past and shows how they continue to inform its language, politics, and values. The result is a work of novelistic vividness and dazzling perspicacity that displays Naipaul at the peak of his powers.",0375708340,9780375708343),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","A proven system for rallying all of an organizations' employees around a new vision and ideas for making the vision stick When something at work isn't going smoothly, managers struggle with what part of the problem to tackle first. Do they start with cost reduction? Or should they go for process improvements first? The authors--who have helped hundreds of companies and individuals change and improve--say spend time and money adjusting the systems in which people operate, rather than targeting people and their performance directly. The authors show that it's in fact possible to change everything at once--with a focus on making such transformations permanent and repeatable.Brand-new Introduction written for the paperback edition Filled with illustrative examples from Northrup Grumman, BHP-Billiton, Reebok, Harvard Business School, and many others Two experts in the field show how to make major transformations happen The book outlines a process for engaging all employees to buy-in to an improved vision of an organization's new and improved future.",0470195592,9780470195598),Hardcover,,220 pages,"

In this moving and compassionate book, hospice nurses Maggie Callanan and Patricia Kelley share their intimate experiences with patients at the end of life, drawn from more than twenty years experience tending the terminally ill. Through their stories we come to appreciate the near-miraculous ways in which the dying communicate their needs, reveal their feelings, and even choreograph their own final moments; we also discover the gifts—of wisdom, faith, and love—that the dying leave for the living to share.Filled with practical advice on responding to the requests of the dying and helping them prepare emotionally and spiritually for death, Final Gifts shows how we can help the dying person live fully to the very end.",0553378767,9780553378764),Paperback,,256 pages,"

She's a bit of a hellcat, one who won't be deterred when she sets her sights on something. And her sights are set on Clint.The one rule Clint never breaks is this--don't get involved with the client. He can look, but he definitely cannot touch--even if it's driving him crazy. Keeping Julie safe until he can figure out who's behind her kidnapping means never letting her out of his sight.

","Elizabeth Stuckey-French welcomes you to Mermaid Springs—a sparkling, bubbly world where secretive mermaids swim, a psychic cat gives mysterious messages, and Elvis still reigns.As a young woman, Grendy swam her way to fame in the kitschy underwater pageants of Mermaid Springs, a premier attraction of pre-Disney Florida. When she met her minister husband, North, she hung up her fins and moved with him to the Midwest. Thirty-six years later, a reunion of the Mermaids of Yesteryear brings Grendy and North back to Mermaid City, where they decide to purchase a second home. In no time at all, Grendy lands a starring role in the “Mermaids on the Moon” Labor Day spectacular, and life seems very good indeed. So when Grendy suddenly goes missing, leaving only a cryptic note behind, her daughter, France, goes to Mermaid City to find out what happened.While taking over care of her erratic six-year-old nephew, Theo, who is most affected by Grendy’s disappearance, France explores the odd circles her mother moved in. Grendy’s fellow Mermaids of Yesteryear—or “merhags”—are forthcoming about every detail of their friendship except her disappearance, and they seem much more interested in convincing France to step into her mother’s fins for the big Labor Day show. As France grows more concerned that her mother may have been a victim of foul play, she makes extraordinary discoveries about Grendy and wonders why the mermaids still talk about the night Elvis came to town.With Elizabeth Stuckey-French’s “wonderfully original voice and zest for offbeat characters” (Chicago Tribune), Mermaids on the Moon is a delightful immersion in a bracingly fresh novel with just the right mix of sly wit and warmth.",0385498942,9780385498944),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

These dark, lyrical, funny narrative poems portray the hopes and joys, pains and despair of people who have been bypassed or bruised by the twentieth century. Budbill has written a song of the down-and-out or overlooked, a song of the unsung. This anthem of the rural renaissance is microcosmic in setting, but universal in scope.",1890132225,9781890132224),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A provocative work by medical ethicist James Hughes, Citizen Cyborg argues that technologies pushing the boundaries of humanness can radically improve our quality of life if they are controlled democratically. Hughes challenges both the technophobia of Leon Kass and Francis Fukuyama and the unchecked enthusiasm of others for limitless human enhancement. He argues instead for a third way, ""democratic transhumanism,"" by asking the question destined to become a fundamental issue of the twenty-first century: How can we use new cybernetic and biomedical technologies to make life better for everyone? These technologies hold great promise, but they also pose profound challenges to our health, our culture, and our liberal democratic political system. By allowing humans to become more than human - ""posthuman"" or ""transhuman"" - the new technologies will require new answers for the enduring issues of liberty and the common good. What limits should we place on the freedom of people to control their own bodies? Who should own genes and other living things? Which technologies should be mandatory, which voluntary, and which forbidden? For answers to these challenges, Citizen Cyborg proposes a radical return to a faith in the resilience of our democratic institutions.",0813341981,9780813341989),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Bridget Dean Mordaunt was a woman of consequence in her own part of the world. Inheriting her father's businesses at the age of nineteen, by the time she was twenty-three in 1880, she was running them as confidently as any man. Yet the path destiny required her to follow was not an easy one. Her feckless cousin Victoria became infatuated with Lionel Filmore, the fortune-hunting elder son of an old but impoverished family living in the decayed grandeur of Grove House. Bridget had no illusions about Lionel, but Victoria's happiness was paramount to her.So a pattern began to form that would shape the lives of generations to come, a pattern of some good and some great evil, but all of it inexorably linking Bridget ever more closely with the Filmores and their house.The Black Candle displays all of Catherine Cookson's narrative skills and shrewd perception of human strengths and frailties which have established her as our most widely-read and best-loved novelist.",0552135763,9780552135764),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","Madeleine L'Engle's first adult novel in four years -- now in paperback! With 23,000 copies sold since May 1996, this ""haunting domestic drama"" (Publishers Weekly) examines the powers of faith and mercy in one family's confrontation with a legacy of evil.Best known for A Wrinkle in Time -- the children's classic that has sold more than 2 million copies since 1962 -- Madeleine L'Engle is as adept at exploring faith and human experience as she is at spinning fascinating, fantastic tales. Now this masterful storyteller blends her two passions and offers an engrossing new story to delight her devoted audience.When Dr. Camilla Dickinson's teenage granddaughter confronts her with the disquieting question of whether Camilla is, in fact, her grandmother, long-kept secrets rise to the surface to test the faith, love and loyalty of the Xanthakos family. This skillful, gripping tale shuttles between past and troubled present, providing clues to a multigenerational mystery -- clues that begin to focus on Camilla's son, the deeply troubled TV idol Artaxias, and on Camilla's mother, the irresistibly beautiful and adulterous Rose. Though riveting and psychologically complex, A Live Coal in the Sea is ""infused with the warmth of love and mercy"" (Booklist), showcasing the keen eye and deep compassion that have made L'Engle one of this century's premier writers on faith and its place in human experience.",0060652861,9780060652869),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","When Max Geist plans a rugged canoe trip on the rivers of Northern Minnesota, fifteen-year-old David fears that dealing with his father--an opinionated, stubborn, novice outdoorsman--will be the roughest part of their journey. Little does he know that once he enters the unforgiving wilderness his life, and that of his family, will be irrevocably changed.At the start of their trip, David's father and younger sister, Janie, briefly cross paths with a group of men who, unbeknownst to the Geist family, are on the lam. Fearing the family may have learned too much about them, the outlaws decide to track down the unknown man and his daughter and, if need be, silence them. When they find the family's campsite, David is away; he returns to find his father in a life-or-death struggle with one man and his sister being savagely attacked by another. David, extraordinarily strong for his age, saves Max and Janie's lives and, in the process, kills a man. But the second man escapes, and David knows he has a partner . . . and that it is only a matter of time before they come back to finish the job they started. The outlaws become the only predators to fear in the wild as the Geist family is hunted down like animals--and uninjured David is the family's only hope for survival. As they tread through the snow-covered rocky terrain in search of safety, what began as a family bonding trip becomes a test of David's mental and physical limits, a journey into manhood and the responsibilities that come with it.The Devil You Know combines the breathtaking intensity of a first-rate literary thriller with the complexity and poignancy of a classic coming-of-age novel. This is a spellbinding suspense novel with heart and soul, a story that will keep you riveted until the very last page.From the Hardcover edition.",1400082277,9781400082278),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","One of the most celebrated and controversial authors in America delivers his first novel—a sweeping chronicle of contemporary Los Angeles that is bold, exhilarating, and utterly original.Dozens of characters pass across the reader's sight lines—some never to be seen again—but James Frey lingers on a handful of LA's lost souls and captures the dramatic narrative of their lives: a bright, ambitious young Mexican-American woman who allows her future to be undone by a moment of searing humiliation; a supremely narcissistic action-movie star whose passion for the unattainable object of his affection nearly destroys him; a couple, both nineteen years old, who flee their suffocating hometown and struggle to survive on the fringes of the great city; and an aging Venice Beach alcoholic whose life is turned upside down when a meth-addled teenage girl shows up half-dead outside the restroom he calls home.Throughout this strikingly powerful novel there is the relentless drumbeat of the millions of other stories that, taken as a whole, describe a city, a culture, and an age. A dazzling tour de force, Bright Shiny Morning illuminates the joys, horrors, and unexpected fortunes of life and death in Los Angeles.",0061573132,9780061573132),Hardcover,,501 pages,"

","Far North is a 2009 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.My father had an expression for a thing that turned out bad. He'd say it had gone west. But going west always sounded pretty good to me. After all, westwards is the path of the sun. And through as much history as I know of, people have moved west to settle and find freedom. But our world had gone north, truly gone north, and just how far north I was beginning to learn.Out on the frontier of a failed state, Makepeace—sheriff and perhaps last citizen—patrols a city's ruins, salvaging books but keeping the guns in good repair.Into this cold land comes shocking evidence that life might be flourishing elsewhere: a refugee emerges from the vast emptiness of forest, whose existence inspires Makepeace to reconnect with human society and take to the road, armed with rough humor and an unlikely ration of optimism.What Makepeace finds is a world unraveling: stockaded villages enforcing an uncertain justice and hidden work camps laboring to harness the little-understood technologies of a vanished civilization. But Makepeace's journey—rife with danger—also leads to an unexpected redemption.Far North takes the reader on a quest through an unforgettable arctic landscape, from humanity's origins to its possible end. Haunting, spare, yet stubbornly hopeful, the novel is suffused with an ecstatic awareness of the world's fragility and beauty, and its ability to recover from our worst trespasses.",0571237770,9780571237777),Paperback,,288 pages,"

For them, that means they live a strongly traditional life, rich with story, music, dance, and magic, governed by the laws of the clan and the ways of the road. To the repressive Puritanical government of 17th century England, however, the gypsies are thieving, fortune-telling vagrants who are most likely allies of the devil. While the Finches have managed to steer clear of trouble, it finds them when they decide to raise dowry money for one of their daughters, by performing in Kingston square one ill-fated market day. A series of terrible events lands the family in jail, charged with murder. Only Emilia and Luka manage to escape, promising to bring back help and free them.The only problem is -- how? Emilia believes in the legend of the charms: it is said that the luck of the Rom has turned sour ever since a long-ago gypsy matriarch broke her chain of charms, giving one charm to each of her five children. Since then, the gypsies have been persecuted and the families have dispersed. If they can gather the charms from the families, Emilia thinks, the strong magic of the Rom will somehow bring her family freedom. Luka, on the other hand, is more practical â�� he wants to enlist the help of the other clans to help the Finches escape.Emilia and Luka must race through the countryside, navigating a hornets' nest of Rom-hating Puritans, Royalist spies, and traitors, if they are to complete their quest before the magistrate delivers a death sentenceâ�¦ ",1423104943,9781423104940),Hardcover,,386 pages,"

She wants to film a documentary about Quentins that will capture the spirit of Dublin from the 1970s to the present day. And Quentins has a thousand stories to tell: tales of love, of betrayal, of revenge; of times when it looked ready for success and times when it seemed as if it must close in failure.

","Throughout history, thinkers from mathematicians to theologians have pondered the mysterious relationship between numbers and the nature of reality. In this fascinating book, Mario Livio tells the tale of a number at the heart of that mystery: phi, or 1.6180339887...This curious mathematical relationship, widely known as ""The Golden Ratio,"" was discovered by Euclid more than two thousand years ago because of its crucial role in the construction of the pentagram, to which magical properties had been attributed. Since then it has shown a propensity to appear in the most astonishing variety of places, from mollusk shells, sunflower florets, and rose petals to the shape of the galaxy. Psychological studies have investigated whether the Golden Ratio is the most aesthetically pleasing proportion extant, and it has been asserted that the creators of the Pyramids and the Parthenon employed it. It is believed to feature in works of art from Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa to Salvador Dali's The Sacrament of the Last Supper, and poets and composers have used it in their works. It has even been found to be connected to the behavior of the stock market!The Golden Ratio is a captivating journey through art and architecture, botany and biology, physics and mathematics. It tells the human story of numerous phi-fixated individuals, including the followers of Pythagoras who believed that this proportion revealed the hand of God; astronomer Johannes Kepler, who saw phi as the greatest treasure of geometry; such Renaissance thinkers as mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa; and such masters of the modern world as Goethe, Cezanne, Bartok, and physicist Roger Penrose. Wherever his quest for the meaning of phi takes him, Mario Livio reveals the world as a place where order, beauty, and eternal mystery will always coexist.From the Hardcover edition.",0767908163,9780767908160),Paperback,,294 pages,"

Langston Braverman returns to Haddington, Indiana (pop. 3,062) after walking out on an academic career that has equipped her for little but lording it over other people. Amos Townsend is trying to minister to a congregation that would prefer simple affirmations to his esoteric brand of theology.What draws these difficult—if not impossible—people together are two wounded little girls who call themselves Immaculata and Epiphany. They are the daughters of Langston’s childhood friend and the witnesses to her murder. And their need for love is so urgent that neither Langston nor Amos can resist it, though they do their best to resist each other. Deftly walking the tightrope between tragedy and comedy, The Solace of Leaving Early is a joyous story about finding one’s better self through accepting the shortcomings of others.",1400033349,9781400033348),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Cleage captures the mores, culture, and rhythm of black urban youth and the romantic tensions between mature black adults as she weaves contemporary issues into a love story.Joyce Mitchell was widowed far too young when her beloved husband, Mitch, died in a tragic accident five years ago. Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call ""twenty-first-century free women."" All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mall and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard to define work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities. Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, ""if you want to make God laugh, make plans."" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress...",0380804883,9780380804887),Kindle Edition,,323 pages,"

","When seventeen-year-old Jane Taylor witnessed her father's death, something happened to her. Ever since, her thoughts have been consumed by death, going so far as to foresee the ever-changing deaths of those around her. Sixteen-year-old Emily Taylor resented her sister's closeness with their father, who died when she was six. With the strange ability to read minds, she drowns the voices out with drugs, sending Jane over the edge. When seventeen-year-old Wes Green was adopted, he moved in next door to Jane, finding in her a childhood friend turned high-school crush. All summer, the pain in his bones seemed unwarranted. He was done growing long ago. When senior year starts, however, the pain only gets worse. The foreseen changes are not expected, and far too animal for his taste. When Max Gordon found himself standing above the dying body of an innocent seven-year-old girl, he saw in her eyes something he hadn't seen in the century he'd spent roaming Earth. Her father was already dead, but there was hope to save her. Jane was her name, and already she was all he ever wanted. It was his job to bring her back, and it was his job to protect her - the biggest mistake of his life. When these four teens enter Glenwood High their senior year, no one but Max could understand the future ahead of them. Drawn together by blood and friendship, they each hide a dark secret that will soon bind them together. Max has to protect Jane, Jane wants to be normal, Wes wants Jane to love him, and Emily just wants the voices to stop... But their fate just wants them dead.",0982272588,9780982272589),Paperback,,367 pages,"

","In the age of the Mazonians women rule through magic - and men suffer what they must. Magical creations only last for a single day (magical food is great for dieting), but that is quite long enough for casting a giant wet blanket (if you're feeling kind) over a would-be rampaging male - or a block of granite (if you're not). No uppity males in Mazonia!But then as now some people rise above what they've been taught. One such is Xylina; somehow she has always understood that being of the wrong gender, or even lacking magical power, is no reason for stripping a human being of dignity. How ironic, then, that the Queen has ordained that in order to avoid execution Xylina must use her magic to publicly conquer the most glorious male Mazonia has ever seen - and how doubly so that together he and Xylina will transform their world.",0671721755,9780671721756),Hardcover,,398 pages,"

Drawing from a wide range of sources - traditional narratives, Indian autobiographies, government transcripts, firsthand interviews, and more - Nabokov has assembled a remarkably rich and vivid collection, representing nothing less than an alternative history of North America. Beginning with the Indian's first encounters with the earliest explorers, traders, missionaries, settlers, and soldiers and continuing to the present, Native American Testimony presents an authentic, challenging picture of an important, tragic, and frequently misunderstood aspect of American history.",0140281592,9780140281590),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","Scandinavia's most famous painter, the Norwegian Edvard Munch (1863–1944), is probably best known for his painting The Scream, a universally recognized icon of terror and despair. (A version of The Scream was stolen from the Edvard Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway, in August 2004, and has not yet been recovered.) But Munch considered himself a writer as well as a painter. Munch began painting as a teenager and, in his young adulthood, studied and worked in Paris and Berlin, where he evolved a highly personal style in paintings and works on paper. And in diaries that he kept for decades, he also experimented with reminiscence, fiction, prose portraits, philosophical speculations, and surrealism. Known as an artist who captured both the ecstasies and the hellish depths of the human condition, Munch conveys these emotions in his diaries but also reveals other facets of his personality in remarks and stories that are alternately droll, compassionate, romantic, and cerebral.This English translation of Edvard Munch's private diaries, the most extensive edition to appear in any language, captures the eloquent lyricism of the original Norwegian text. The journal entries in this volume span the period from the 1880s, when Munch was in his twenties, until the 1930s, reflecting the changes in his life and his work. The book is illustrated with fifteen of Munch's drawings, many of them rarely seen before. Though excerpts from these diaries have been previously published elsewhere, no translation has captured the real passion and poetry of Munch's voice. This translation lets Munch speak for himself and evokes the primal passion of his diaries. J. Gill Holland's exceptional work adds a whole new level to our understanding of the artist and the depth of his scream.",,,Paperback,,224 pages,"

Scriptor's life story, from his early life among the housesteads of an obscure province to his role in the ultimate confrontation with Nazism, was intimately connected with the major political and social developments of his time. His highly personal record of events was praised even in his own lifetime for its honesty and intimacy, as well for capturing the scale of a war that consumed thousands of worlds.This exciting new translation of a classic work of military history is accessible to new readers and existing students of the War alike.

","Dies ist die faszinierendste Entdeckung, die die Menschen machten, als sie anfingen, das Weltall zu bereisen: daß alles Leben im Universum miteinander verwandt ist. Sterbende Welten, deren Sonnen zu Novae werden und deren Atmosphäre und Oberflächenschichten von der Wucht der explodierenden Sonne hinweggefegt werden, geben wie ein letztes Vermächtnis Lebenskeime ab, die in den Schweifen von Kometen durch die unwirtliche Kälte des Alls reisen, mit Sonnenwinden und Magnetstürmen die weiten Abgründe überqueren, um Tausende oder Hunderttausende von Jahren später junge Planeten zu befruchten und den Zyklus des Lebens aufs Neue beginnen zu lassen.Doch andererseits kann das Leben nicht im All entstanden sein. Irgendwo in den unauslotbaren Tiefen des Universums, auf irgendeinem der zahllosen Planeten, auf denen die Schöpfung experimentiert hat, muß das Leben ursprünglich entstanden sein. Niemand hat diesen Planeten je gefunden, aber die Überlieferungen aller Völker werden nicht müde, davon zu erzählen - von dem Ort, an dem einst die Dunkelheit endete und das Leben begann. Es ist ein sagenhafter Ort. Unvorstellbare Schätze, heißt es, warten dort auf den Entdecker. Manche Sagen wollen wissen, daß auf dieser Welt die Unsterblichkeit zu finden sei. Eine Legende schließlich - die älteste von allen - behauptet, auf diesem Planeten sei es möglich, Gott zu begegnen...",3453520955,9783453520950),,,,,"['Science Fiction', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'European Literature', 'German Literature']"

","Profane, piercingly honest, and scathingly funny, Animal's People is the stunning tale of an unforgettable character: Animal, a young man whose back was twisted beyond repair in an industrial accident. It is a dark world, shot through with flashes of joy and lunacy.""I used to be human once. So I'm told. I don't remember it myself, but people who knew me when I was small say I walked on two feet, just like a human being..."" Ever since he can remember, Animal has gone on all fours, his back twisted beyond repair by the catastrophic events of ""that night"" when a burning fog of poison smoke from the local factory blazed out over the town of Khaufpur, and the Apocalypse visited his slums. Now just turned seventeen and well schooled in street work, he lives by his wits, spending his days jamisponding (spying) on town officials and looking after the elderly nun who raised him, Ma Franci. His nights are spent fantasizing about Nisha, the girlfriend of the local resistance leader, and wondering what it must be like to get laid. When Elli Barber, a young American doctor, arrives in Khaufpur to open a free clinic for the still suffering townsfolk -- only to find herself struggling to convince them that she isn't there to do the dirty work of the Kampani -- Animal gets caught up in a web of intrigues, scams, and plots with the unabashed aim of turning events to his own advantage. Profane, piercingly honest, and scathingly funny, Animal's People illuminates a dark world shot through with flashes of joy and lunacy. A stunning tale of an unforgettable character, it is an unflinching look at what it means to be human: the wounds that never heal and a spirit that will not be quenched.",0743259203,9780743259200),Paperback,,374 pages,"

","More than two thousand years after his death, Julius Caesar remains one of the great figures of history. He shaped Rome for generations, and his name became a synonym for ""emperor"" -- not only in Rome but as far away as Germany and Russia. He is best known as the general who defeated the Gauls and doubled the size of Rome's territories. But, as Philip Freeman describes in this fascinating new biography, Caesar was also a brilliant orator, an accomplished writer, a skilled politician, and much more.Julius Caesar was a complex man, both hero and villain. He possessed great courage, ambition, honor, and vanity. Born into a noble family that had long been in decline, he advanced his career cunningly, beginning as a priest and eventually becoming Rome's leading general. He made alliances with his rivals and then discarded them when it suited him. He was a spokesman for the ordinary people of Rome, who rallied around him time and again, but he profited enormously from his conquests and lived opulently. Eventually he was murdered in one of the most famous assassinations in history.Caesar's contemporaries included some of Rome's most famous figures, from the generals Marius, Sulla, and Pompey to the orator and legislator Cicero as well as the young politicians Mark Antony and Octavius (later Caesar Augustus). Caesar's legendary romance with the Egyptian queen Cleopatra still fascinates us today.In this splendid biography, Freeman presents Caesar in all his dimensions and contradictions. With remarkable clarity and brevity, Freeman shows how Caesar dominated a newly powerful Rome and shaped its destiny. This book will captivate readers discovering Caesar and ancient Rome for the first time as well as those who have a deep interest in the classical world.",0743289536,9780743289535),Hardcover,,405 pages,"

","I wrapped up my grandmother's tea cup collection and my mother's china, then grabbed a violin I'd hidden way back in my closet that made me cry, a gold necklace with a dolphin that my father gave me two weeks before he died of a heart attack when I was twelve and, at midnight, with that moon as bright as the blazes, I left Chicago. When Jeanne Stewart stops at The Opera Man's Cafe in Weltana, Oregon, to eat pancakes for the first time in twelve years, she has no idea she's also about to order up a whole new future. It's been barely a week since she succumbed to a spectacularly public nervous breakdown in front of hundreds of the nation's most important advertising and PR people. Jeanne certainly had her reasons--her mother's recent death, the discovery that her boyfriend had been sleeping with a dozen other women, and the assault charges that resulted when Jeanne retaliated in a creative way against him, involving condoms and peanut oil.  Now, en route to her brother's house in Portland, Jeanne impulsively decides to spend some time in picturesque Weltana. Staying at a B&B run by the eccentric, endearing Rosvita, she meets a circle of quirky new friends at her court-ordered Anger Management classes. Like Jeanne, all of them are trying to become better, braver versions of themselves. Yet the most surprising discoveries are still to come--a good man who steadily makes his way into her heart and a dilapidated house that with love and care might be transformed into something wholly her own, just like the new life she is slowly building, piece by piece.  As heartfelt as it is hilarious, The Last Time I Was Me is a warm, wise novel about breaking down, opening up, and finally letting go of everything we thought we should be, in order to claim the life that has been waiting all along.",0758214634,9780758214638),Paperback,,405 pages,"

The fifth part of Cao Xueqin's magnificent saga, ""The Dreamer Awakes"", was carefully edited and completed by Gao E some decades later. It continues the story of the changing fortunes of the Jia dynasty, focussing on Bao-yu, now married to Bao-chai, after the tragic death of his beloved Dai-yu. Against such worldly elements as death, financial ruin, marriage, decadence and corruption, his karmic journey unfolds. Like a sleepwalker through life, Bao-yu is finally awakened by a vision, which reveals to him that life itself is merely a dream, 'as moonlight mirrored in the water'.",014044372X,9780140443721),Paperback,,384 pages,"

When I read her words, I felt acknowledged for my journey and for being a woman in these complex times... Thank you, Sabrina, for sharing your gift with us. May we all continue to share our journeys together so we know we are not alone.""--from the Foreword by Hilary Swank, actorFrom the acclaimed twenty-five-year-old author/artist of the stunning visual memoir Spilling Open comes the all-new multimedia installment of her intimate journey Brave on the Rocks: If You Don't Go, You Don't See.Picking up where Spilling Open left off, Sabrina Ward Harrison tells us about the surprising reaction to her first book. Via her readers' letters and e-mails, she realized that through her journal she had become an identifying voice for women around the world. However, along with recognition came a certain pressure to uphold her new image. Overwhelmed by her attempt to live up to what she thought she had to become, Sabrina decided to head out on her own. She chose as her destination Italy, a place she had always dreamed and written about, a place she felt she could go to ""recolor"" herself. In her journey she discovered a universal identity with other travelers and a particular kinship with the women she met. But back home she struggled to keep her newfound confidence intact as she navigated her life.Harrison writes and illustrates with a powerful and creative voice. Her thoughts are real and brave. She explores with sensitivity questions of love, faith, growing pains, being true to oneself, and what it means to be unique. With unfaltering honesty, she allows us to witness and share in her reconnection with herself, her growing and reaching, and, ultimately, her voyage home again.",0375756639,9780375756634),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Why is it that despite our best efforts, many of us remain fundamentally unhappy and unfulfilled in our lives? In this provocative and inspiring book, David Richo distills thirty years of experience as a therapist to explain the underlying roots of unhappiness—and the surprising secret to finding freedom and fulfillment.  There are certain facts of life that we cannot change—the unavoidable ""givens"" of human existence: (1) everything changes and ends, (2) things do not always go according to plan, (3) life is not always fair, (4) pain is a part of life, and (5) people are not loving and loyal all the time. Richo shows us that by dropping our deep-seated resistance to these givens, we can find liberation and discover the true richness that life has to offer. Blending Western psychology and Eastern spirituality, including practical exercises, Richo shows us how to open up to our lives—including to what is frightening, painful, or disappointing—and discover our greatest gifts.",1590303083,9781590303085),Paperback,,159 pages,"

","The work examined traumatization in childhood and the potential effect upon the adult individual. Previous research focused on safeguarding children and minimizing the effects of trauma. The intent was to determine the underlying factors that contribute to an adult’s perception and worldview in relationship to childhood traumatic experiences.Participants were adult men and women who self-report traumatization in childhood. The core of the research was a semi-guided interview protocol. The research used three supporting questionnaires as a basis for demographics. The research anticipates clarification between the effects of childhood trauma and the plausibility that the trauma may be a source of difficulty for adults; therefore, perpetuating one’s life struggles or a source of inspiration to move forward. It was discovered that those children that possessed the factors that reinforce resiliency tended to have amore positive perception and worldview.",,,,1st Edition,152 pages,"

","The debut novel from the author of Summer at Gaglow, called ""a near-seamless meshing of family feeling, history and imagination"" by the New York Times Book Review. Escaping gray London in 1972, a beautiful, determined mother takes her daughters, aged 5 and 7, to Morocco in search of adventure, a better life, and maybe love. Hideous Kinky follows two little English girls -- the five-year-old narrator and Bea, her seven-year-old sister -- as they struggle to establish some semblance of normal life on a trip to Morocco with their hippie mother, Julia. Once in Marrakech, Julia immerses herself in Sufism and her quest for personal fulfillment, while her daughters rebel -- the older by trying to recreate her English life, the younger by turning her hopes for a father on a most unlikely candidate. Shocking and wonderful, Hideous Kinky is at once melancholy and hopeful. A remarkable debut novel from one of England's finest young writers, Hideous Kinky was inspired by the author's own experiences as a child. Esther Freud, daughter of the artist Lucian Freud and great-granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, lived in Marrakech for one and a half years with her older sister Bella and her mother.",0241131790,9780241131794),,,,,"['Fiction', 'Cultural', 'Africa', 'Travel', 'Northern Africa', 'Morocco']"

Così questa storia di un verificatore dei pesi e delle misure che si trova a scoprire che attorno a lui tutti i pesi sono falsi diventa un apologo sui temi perenni della giustizia, della passione e della colpa.

But what should be a happy time is riddled with doubt.Syfka, an ancient falcon, has arrived from Ahnmik claiming that one of her people is hidden in their midst. The falcons are more powerful than the avians and serpiente combined, and Syfka shows nothing but contempt for Zane and Danica's alliance. To Zane's horror, his own people seem just as appalled as Syfka is by the thought of a mixed-blood child becoming heir to the throne.Is Syfka's lost falcon just a ruse to stir up controversy among them? The truth lies somewhere in their tangled pasts and the search will redefine Zane and Danica's fragile future.",0440238048,9780440238041),Paperback,,167 pages,"

","Santiago Ram�n y Cajal (1852-1934) made prolific and lasting contributions to understanding ""the life of the infinitely small.""Santiago Ram�n y Cajal (1852-1934) made prolific and lasting contributions to understanding ""the life of the infinitely small."" Widely thought of as the founder of neuroscience, Cajal made remarkable explorations into the organization and function of the nervous system. His work is still referred to more than that of any other scientist in the field.W. Maxwell Cowan's foreword to this edition conveys the excitement and energy of Cajal's life and endeavors, the liveliness and flamboyance of his engagements with the microscope. Cowan surveys Cajal's salient discoveries, noting that almost every important conceptual issue in neurobiology was foreshadowed in Cajal's work: the initial description of the climbing fibers of the cerebellum, the discovery of the growth cone, the concept of the ""dynamic polarity"" of the neurom an anticipation of the later discovery of axonal transport, and the prediction that new synapses may be formed throughout life to serve as a physical basis for learning and memory.W.

","It's every girl's fantasy to find herself pulled into a new magical world-and make a difference to the extraordinary creatures that live there. That's what awaits them in Avalon, a place where magic is real. It begins with winged cats, mighty mistwolves, duck-like quiffles and one pretty amazing golden ferret that are not of this world. Hurt, hungry and barely alive, they have come to be healed, to be helped, to get home - for a last desperate attempt at survival. But the magical animals did not come alone. The evil that stalked them in their world has followed them into ours. It will not stop until it gets what it wants: the secret map to a place called Avalon. The animals' only hope is to fulfill an ancient prophecy and find three very different, but special girls: a healer, a warrior and a blazing star, who can lead them through a web of magical worlds, to the place from which all magic flows, Avalon.",1933164646,9781933164649),Hardcover,,175 pages,"

Gloriana is Albion and Albion is Gloriana; if one falls, so too will the other. And Gloriana is oppressed by the burden this places upon her - and by the fact that she remains incapable of orgasm. The maintenance of the delicate balance that keeps Albion and Gloriana thriving depends of Montfallcon, Gloriana's Chancellor, and on his network of spies and assassins - in particular on Quire, cold hearted seducer of virtue and murderer of innocence. When Quire falls out with Montfallcon, he forms an alliance with his greatest enemy and conceives a plan to ruin Gloriana, destroy Albion, the empire and the Golden Age itself. But even the utterly ruthless Quire does not fully understand what he has set in motion when he persuades the Queen to fall in love with him...Moorcock's masterly evocation of Gloriana's strange and secretive palace and of a vibrant London make this one of his most powerful and memorable novels.",0575073594,9780575073593),Paperback,Fantasy Masterworks,368 pages,"

","In this engaging and astute anthology of jazz criticism, Larry Kart casts a wide net. Discussing nearly seventy major jazz figures and many of the music’s key stylistic developments, Kart sees jazz as a unique perpetual narrative—one in which musicians, their audiences, and the evolving music itself are intimately intertwined.Because jazz arose from the collision of specific peoples under particular conditions, says Kart, its development has been unusually immediate, visible, and intense. Kart has reacted to and judged the music in a similarly active, attentive, and personal manner. His involvement and attention to detail are visible in these pieces: essays that analyze the supposed return to tradition that the music of Wynton Marsalis has come to exemplify; searching accounts of the careers of Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, Bill Evans, and Lennie Tristano; and writing that explores jazz’s relationship to American popular song and examines the jazz musician’s role as actual and would-be social rebel.",0300104200,9780300104202),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","There are only two tragedies in life. One is not getting your heart's desire - and the other? Getting it. Fourteen-year-old Lucky Khalil loves three things: football, Star Wars and Portia, the girl who works in his grandfather's corner shop. In that order. But Lucky has a destiny – worse than a destiny, he has a dream. He dreams that one day, his lucky left foot will win the World Cup for England . It torments him, because it tastes real, because when he wakes he weeps with disappointment that it is just a dream. Meanwhile, Lucky’s mother Delphine seems to have had all her dreams come true. But Delphine feels increasingly trapped in her apparently perfect marriage and gilded lifestyle. She fantasizes about rediscovering the freedom of her youth, but rekindling a relationship with her maverick father-in-law, Zaki, is only going to end in disaster.Zaki, a charming gambler who loved and lost Delphine long before she married his sensible and successful son, feels equally trapped in the corner shop that he has unwillingly run for years for his family's sake. He wonders whether the time has come to abandon his middle class responsibilities, to try once more to achieve his own long-forgotten dreams.As each of the Khalils discovers in Roopa Farooki’s beautifully written and richly layered tale, the closer one's dreams become, the more risk there is of losing sight of what really matters.",033045594X,9780330455947),Paperback,,355 pages,"

","Greg Gutfeld, the acclaimed host of the popular, nightly Fox News show Red Eye, has packed this book full of his most aggressive (and funny) diatribes -- each chapter exploring Unspeakable Truths that cut right to the core and go well beyond just politics. Greg deconstructs pop culture, media, kids, disease, race, food, sex, celebrity, current events, and nearly every other aspect of life, with Truths including but not limited to: ""if you're over 25 and still use party as a verb, then you're beyond redemption,"" ""the media wanted bird flu to kill thousands,"" ""attractive people don't write for a living,"" ""death row inmates make the best husbands,"" and ""the urge to punch Zach Braff in the face is completely natural.""With an irreverent voice, incredible wit, and a firm take on just about everything, this is a manual for how to think about stuff, by a guy who has thought about precisely that same stuff. And, even if you disagree with Greg, this book will make you laugh--guaranteed.**Not guaranteed",0446552305,9780446552301),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Each year, on Frogg Day, a parade fills the streets and children are not allowed to take part,but it hasn't always been that way and it certainly doesn't seem fair to Hazel Green. So she decides to rally the children of the Moody Building to build a float for the parade. But things go awry when she is accused of stealing a recipe from her favorite baker and giving it to his rival. At the same time, the children ban her from participating in the parade because she tried to convince them that their float would topple. But with the help of her friend Yakov, a.k.a. ""The Yak,"" Hazel proves her innocence and leads the children to glory on Frogg Day. From Odo Hirsch, an internationally best-selling author, and in the spirit of Harriet the Spy and Anastasia Krupnik, comes this spunky, unforgettable, irresistible character: Hazel Green.

In 'The River Nemunas', a teenaged orphan moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather, and discovers a world in which myth becomes real. 'Village 113' is about the building of the Three Gorges Dam and the seedkeeper who guards the history of a village soon to be submerged. And in 'Afterworld,' the radiant, cathartic final story, a woman who escaped the Holocaust is haunted by visions of her childhood friends in Germany, yet finds solace in the tender ministrations of her grandson.The stories in Memory Wall show us how we figure the world, and show Anthony Doerr to be one of the masters of the form.",1439182809,9781439182802),Hardcover,,243 pages,"

Most Americans don’t exactly roll out the welcome mat for Others. In the small town of Klikamuks, Washington, coming out as a person with paranormal abilities means staring down the barrel of a shotgun. Gwen hasn’t even told the truth to her boyfriend, Zack, who she hopes will be the boy to take her virginity.When a pack of werewolves claims the national forest behind Gwen’s house as their territory, the tensions in Klikamuks escalate—into murder.

At the outset, Pug looks back upon the decade that will form her narrative and begins her tale with trepidation: """"The man I shot had friends whose hearts and minds remain as closed as his once was. It has become my habit to listen for footsteps behind me in the dark ... As I stir the smoldering ashes of the past, I can feel the searing heat on my face."""" Here is a first-person voice that is both sassy and poetic. Pug’s """"confession"""" builds, inexorably, toward what appears to be a justified homicide.

","""Evangelicals have been living on the periphery of responsible intellectual existence. The average Christian does not realize that there is an intellectual war going on in the universities and in the professional journals and scholarly societies. Christianity is being attacked from all sides as irrational or outmoded, and millions of students, our future generation of leaders have absorbed this viewpoint. This is a war which we cannot afford to lose.... ""In addition to serving, like the rest of theology in general, as an expression of our loving God with all our minds, apologetics specifically serves to show to unbelievers the truth of the Christian faith, to confirm that faith to believers, and to reveal and explore the connections between Christian doctrine and other truths.... Apologetics... is a theoretical discipline that tries to answer the question, What rational defense can be given for the Christian faith?""This book by respected philosopher and theologian William Lane Craig has been thoroughly revised and updated to equip believers in the successful proclamation of biblical truth claims. The author gives careful attention to crucial questions and concerns, including: How Do I Know Christianity Is True?, The Absurdity of Life Without God, The Existence of God, The Problem of Miracles, and The Resurrection of Jesus.An invaluable scholarly resource for all committed defenders of the Christian faith.",0891077642,9780891077640),Paperback,Revised Edition,350 pages,"

","In The Caves of Steel, Isaac Asimov first introduced Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw, who would later become his favorite protagonists.   The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the novel opens. Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a Spacer Ambassador, lives in Spacetown, the Spacer outpost just outside New York City. For some time, he has tried to convince the Earth government to loosen its anti-robot restrictions. One morning, he is discovered outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer. Elijah must work with a Spacer partner, a highly advanced robot who is visually identical to a human, named R. Daneel Olivaw, even though Elijah, like many Earth residents, has a low opinion of robots. Together, they search for the murderer and try to avert an interstellar diplomatic incident.  Like its famous predecessor, The Nakes Sun is a whodunit story, in addition to being science fiction. The story arises from the murder of Rikaine Delmarre, a prominent scientist of Solaria, a planet politically hostile to Earth. Elijah Baley is called in to investigate, at the request of the Solarian government. He is again partnered with the humaniform robot R. Daneel Olivaw.   The Robots of Dawn is the third novel in Asimov's Robot series. Elijah Baley and R. Daneel Olivaw team up to solve the roboticide of a robot identical to Olivaw on the Spacer world of Aurora. The robot's inventor, Han Fastolfe, has been implicated. Fastolfe, who was last seen in The Caves of Steel, is the best roboticist on Aurora. He has admitted that he is the only person with the skill to have done it, although he denies doing it. Fastolfe is also a prominent member of the Auroran political faction that favors Earth. Implication in the crime threatens his political career; therefore, it is politically expedient that he be exonerated.",0345331192,9780345331199),Paperback,,684 pages,"

","A frank, funny, no-holds-barred memoir that reveals the Deal or No Deal host’s ongoing struggle with OCD and ADHD–and how it has shaped his life and career. Howie Mandel is one of the most recognizable names in entertainment–respected by his peers and beloved by audiences as the host of the enormously popular prime-time game show Deal or No Deal. With a career that spans three decades and many different show-business platforms–he’s a renowned stand-up comedian who continues to perform more than 150 sold-out shows a year, he created the award-winning TV show Bobby’s World, he’s starred in feature films and the hit TV series St. Elsewhere, and he’s also hosted his own daytime talk show–he’s one of the most versatile performers anywhere. But there are aspects of his personal and professional life he’s never talked about publicly–until now.Eleven years ago, Mandel first told the world about his “germophobia.” He’s recently started discussing his adult ADHD as well. Now, for the first time, he reveals the details of his struggle with these challenging disorders. He catalogs his numerous fears and neuroses and shares entertaining stories about how he has tried to integrate them into his act. “If I’m making myself laugh,” he writes, “then I’m distracted from all the other things going on in my head that are, at times, torturous.” And he speaks frankly and honestly about the ways his condition has affected his personal life–as a son, husband, and father of three.Fans who’ve been dying to know “the deal” behind Mandel’s remarkable rise through the show-business ranks will be rewarded with many never-before-told anecdotes, each one generously leavened with Mandel’s trademark humor. There are tales from every phase of his colorful career–from his early days as a teenage carpet salesman and aspiring stand-up comic to his stint opening for Diana Ross, his six years on St. Elsewhere, and beyond. As heartfelt as it is hilarious, Here’s the Deal: Don’t Touch Me is the story of one man’s effort to draw comic inspiration out of his darkest, most vulnerable places. It’s sure to please Howie Mandel’s legion of fans–and provide hope to the millions who strive to succeed in spite of OCD and ADHD.",0553807862,9780553807868),Hardcover,,220 pages,"

","Authorized, intimate, and definitive, Ben Hogan: A Life is the long-awaited biography of one of golf’s greatest, most enigmatic legends, narrated with the unique eloquence that has made author James Dodson a critically acclaimed national bestseller. One man is often credited with shaping the landscape of modern golf. Ben Hogan was a short, trim, impeccably dressed Texan whose fierce work ethic, legendary steel nerves, and astonishing triumph over personal disaster earned him not only an army of adoring fans, but one of the finest careers in the history of the sport. Hogan captured a record-tying four U.S. Opens, won five of six major tournaments in a single season, and inspired future generations of professional golfers from Palmer to Norman to Woods.Yet for all his brilliance, Ben Hogan was an enigma. He was an American hero whose personal life, inner motivation, and famed “secret” were the source of great public mystery. As Hogan grew into a giant on the pro tour, the combination of his cool outward demeanor and invincible, laser-guided accuracy on the golf course froze formidable opponents in their tracks. In 1949, at the peak of his career, Hogan’s mystique was reinforced by a catastrophic automobile accident in which he and his wife, Valerie, were nearly killed after being hit head-on by a Greyhound bus. Doctors predicted Hogan might never walk again – let alone set foot on another golf course. But his miraculous three-year recovery and comeback led to one of the greatest performances in golf history when in 1953 he won the Masters, the U.S. Open, and the British Open (something that’s never been repeated). In this first-ever family-authorized biography, renowned author James Dodson expertly and emotionally reconstructs Hogan’s complicated life. He discovers an intensely honest man handicapped by self-doubt, buoyed by the determination to prove his own abilities, and unable to escape a long-buried childhood tragedy – the core of the Hogan “secret.” Dodson also reveals both the legendary devotion and eventual strain in Hogan’s sixty-two-year marriage, and a Hogan rarely seen by the public: a warm, jovial man whose charitable spirit and sharp business sense enabled him to build the powerful golf equipment company bearing his name to this day. Ben Hogan: A Life is the authoritative inside portrait golf fans have long awaited.",0767908635,9780767908634),Paperback,,544 pages,"

","Mircea Cartarescu, born in 1956, is one of Romania's leading novelists and poets. This translation of his 1989 novel Nostalgia, writes Andrei Codrescu, ""introduces to English a writer who has always had a place reserved for him in a constellation that includes the Brothers Grimm, Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Bruno Schulz, Julio Cortazar, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera, and Milorad Pavic, to mention just a few."" Like most of his literary contemporaries of the avant-garde Eighties Generation, his major work has been translated into several European languages, with the notable exception, until now, of English.Readers opening the pages of Nostalgia should brace themselves for a verbal tidal wave of the imagination that will wash away previous ideas of what a novel is or ought to be. Although each of its five chapters is separate and stands alone, a thematic, even mesmeric harmony finds itself in children's games, the music of the spheres, humankind's primordial myth-making, the origins of the universe, and in the dilapidated tenement blocks of an apocalyptic Bucharest during the years of communist dictatorship.",0811215881,9780811215886),Paperback,,361 pages,"

Those are the wrenching questions that haunted every moment of David Sheff’s journey through his son Nic’s addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets. David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 A.M. phone calls (is it Nic? The police? The hospital?), the rehabs. His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll, but as a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on him. Beautiful Boy is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional roller coaster of loving a child who seems beyond help.",0618683356,9780618683352),Hardcover,,317 pages,"

Such are the observations made and ill-gotten lessons learned in this fictional autobiographical narrative of breathtaking range and power. Ross Leckie not only presents a vivid re-creation of the great struggle of the Punic wars and the profoundly bloody battle for Rome, but also succeeds in bringing the almost mythical figure of Hannibal to life. Introspective, educated on the Greeks, Hannibal has never been presented quite like this. Written from Hannibal's perspective, this riveting, unique historical novel charts the rise and fall of the great Carthaginian general who came so close to bringing down Rome. A tragic chronicle of love and hate, heroism and cruelty, Hannibal is a dramatic and ultimately nourishing exploration of the inner life and epic consequences of one of humanity's greatest adventurers and most bloodthirsty leaders.",1841955698,9781841955698),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","It's hardly the type of wedding Fiona MacLean dreamed of. No family, no guests, just a groom who's been dragged -- literally -- to the altar. But if marriage to Black Jack Kincaid, the handsome wastrel she'd sworn never to see again, will avert a bloody war between their clans, so be it. Surely she can share his bed without losing her heart....    Known throughout Scotland and London as a wild rogue, Jack is accustomed to waking in dire situations, but...married? Long ago, he and Fiona reveled in a youthful passion. Now, the fiery, sensual lass is his once more. And though their marriage is in name only, Jack is determined to win her forever -- body and soul....",1416525033,9781416525035),Mass Market Paperback,,313 pages,"

","Madeleine Winger's thoughts consume her. This college coed's mental object of affection is a gorgeous dark-haired, green-eyed musician. She can't stop her mind from filling with idealistic perceptions and fantastical scenarios starring him. Every time she sees him at church or when he comes into the music store where she works, Maddy is sure she will need a defibrillator to restart her heart. She doesn't even know his name, nor has she ever spoken to him, but she can't stop her heart and mind from their unending crush on this guy, for over a year now. Maddy proclaims herself a ""lust-o-holic."" Maddy knows she must learn the real way to have a relationship with a guy. Not the gotta-jump-into-bed-with-him-so-he'll-like-me, kind of way. Maddy knows all too well from her past that this tactic never works. Besides, Peter is different from any other guy she has dated in the past. Peter is the guitar player in a local up and coming garage band, who has made a fresh recommitment to his faith. Maddy would be the first woman he has dated in a year. It's so different this time for him-dating God's way. It is a tale of pure sweetness and beauty as two people learn to love each other under the hand of the Almighty. Maddy must also cope with her promiscuous dorm roommate, as well as her plastic surgery obsessed bleach blonde mother, who is persistently critical of Maddy's dyed-black hair and Gothic style. Can Peter and Maddy wrestle with their desires and keep their thoughts in check, and their hands off of each other? Their tale of relationship trials and triumphs will make you laugh out loud and you'll probably cry too, so keep a tissue or two handy. THE GARDEN KEY, the prelude novel to MIND OVER MADELEINE, is a New Adult genre tale of lust, redemption and really good cheeseburgers that will move you as it illustrates the urgent need for faith in our lives, especially when it comes to love relationships.",0615314775,9780615314778),Paperback,Order your copy at www.CloudPillarPublishing.com,348 pages,"

","From a dazzling new voice in fantasy comes a mesmerizing tale of treachery, passion, intrigue, betrayal, and an act of pure vengeance that threatens to bring down a kingdom.Seething with decadent appetites unchecked by law or gods, the court of Antyre is ruled by the last of a dissolute aristocracy. But now to the kingdom comes a handsome, enigmatic nobleman, Maledicte, whose perfect manners, enchanting charisma, and brilliant swordplay entice the most jaded tastes . . . and conceal a hunger beyond reckoning.For Maledicte is actually a woman named Miranda–a beautiful thief raised in the city’s vicious slums. And she will do anything–even promise her soul to Black-Winged Ani, the most merciless of Antyre’s exiled gods–to reclaim Janus, the lover whose passion still haunts her dreams. As her machinations strike at the heart of Antyre’s powerful noble houses, Miranda must battle not only her own growing bloodlust, but also her lover’s newly kindled and ruthless ambitions. As Ani’s force grows insatiable and out of control, Miranda has no choice but to wield a weapon that may set her free . . . or forever doom her and everything she holds dear.From the Trade Paperback edition.",034549573X,9780345495730),Paperback,,434 pages,"

","Hello. I am Daniel Handler, the author of this book. Did you know that authors often write the summaries that appear on their book's dust jacket? You might want to think about that the next time you read something like, ""A dazzling page-turner, this novel shows an internationally acclaimed storyteller at the height of his astonishing powers.""""Adverbs"" is a novel about love -- a bunch of different people, in and out of different kinds of love. At the start of the novel, Andrea is in love with David -- or maybe it's Joe -- who instead falls in love with Peter in a taxi. At the end of the novel, it's Joe who's in the taxi, falling in love with Andrea, although it might not be Andrea, or in any case it might not be the same Andrea, as Andrea is a very common name. So is Allison, who is married to Adrian in the middle of the novel, although in the middle of the ocean she considers a fling with Keith and also with Steve, whom she meets in an automobile, unless it's not the same Allison who meets the Snow Queen in a casino, or the same Steve who meets Eddie in the middle of the forest. . . .It might sound confusing, but that's love, and as the author -- me -- says, ""It is not the nouns. The miracle is the adverbs, the way things are done."" This novel is about people trying to find love in the ways it is done before the volcano erupts and the miracle ends. Yes, there's a volcano in the novel. In my opinion a volcano automatically makes a story more interesting.",0060724412,9780060724412),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","The great Calculor of Libris was forced to watch as Overmayor Zarvora had four of its components lined up against a wall and shot for negligence. Thereafter, its calculations were free from errors, and that was just as well-for only this strangest of calculating machines and its two thousand enslaved components could save the world from a new ice age. And all the while a faint mirrorsun hangs in the night sky, warning of the cold to come. In Sean McMullen's glittering, dynamic, and exotic world two millennia from now, there is no more electricity, wind engines are leading-edge technology, librarians fight duels to settle disputes, steam power is banned by every major religion, and a mysterious siren ""Call"" lures people to their death. Nevertheless, the brilliant and ruthless Zarvora intends to start a war in space against inconceivably ancient nuclear battle stations. Unbeknownst to Zarvora, however, the greatest threat to humanity is neither a machine nor a force but her demented and implacable enemy Lemorel, who has resurrected an obscene and evil concept from the distant past: Total War.

It is state of the art in economic theory and political philosophy.

A rare and remarkable cultural history of World War I that unearths the roots of modernism
  Dazzling in its originality, Rites of Spring probes the origins, impact, and aftermath of World War I, from the premiere of Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913 to the death of Hitler in 1945. Recognizing that The Great War was the psychological turning point . . . for modernism as a whole, author Modris Eksteins examines the lives of ordinary people, works of modern literature, and pivotal historical events to redefine the way we look at our past and toward our future.",0395937582,9780395937587),Paperback,,396 pages,"

","Este romance dá continuidade à tetralogia iniciada com «Os Pioneiros» - a saga de uma família portuguesa fundada no século passado. Neste novo volume são evocadas aventuras, ambientes, acontecimentos políticos e sociais, mentalidades e tudo isso religado por uma subtilíssima trama de relações. Destacam-se figuras vivas, evoluindo e agindo com o mesmo arrebatamento que a todos contaminava nessa época de intensa mudança. Mais do que um retrato de família, esta narrativa ganha uma realidade própria que se apoia tanto na memória da ""Tia Graça"" quanto numa rigorosa e apaixonada investigação sobre um tempo que decorre entre o fim da Monarquia, a implantação da República e a I Guerra Mundial. Luísa Beltrão reafirma neste novo romance um estilo bem pessoal, simultaneamente denso e leve, que nos transporta magicamente para dentro de um quotidiano vivido, onde nos reconhecemos no nosso próprio devir colectivo.",9722318578,9789722318570),Paperback,Large print,272 pages,"

","From William Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner to Toni Morrison's Beloved, modern American fiction engaged with slavery has provoked fiery controversy. So will The Longest Memory, the powerful, beautifully crafted, internationally acclaimed fictional debut of prizewinning Guyanese poet Fred D'Aguiar. In language extraordinary for its tautness and resonance, The Longest Memory tells the story of a rebellious, fiercely intelligent young slave, who in 1810 attempts to flee a Virginia plantation - and of his father who inadvertently betrays him. The young slave's love for a white girl who slakes his forbidden thirst for learning and his painful relationship with his father are hauntingly evoked in this novel of astonishing lyrical simplicity. It is a measure of D'Aguiar's achievement and bravery that The Longest Memory is informed not only by the complicities between black slave and white master but also by the tensions among slaves themselves - between stoic survivalists and passionate rebels. Remarkable for its keenness of observation, subtlety, and restraint, The Longest Memory heralds the arrival of a major new voice in the contemporary literature of the African diaspora.",0099462214,9780099462217),Paperback,,144 pages,"

","By the award-winning author of Team of Rivals and The Bully Pulpit, Wait Till Next Year is Doris Kearns Goodwin’s touching memoir of growing up in love with her family and baseball.Set in the suburbs of New York in the 1950s, Wait Till Next Year re-creates the postwar era, when the corner store was a place to share stories and neighborhoods were equally divided between Dodger, Giant, and Yankee fans.  We meet the people who most influenced Goodwin’s early life: her mother, who taught her the joy of books but whose debilitating illness left her housebound: and her father, who taught her the joy of baseball and to root for the Dodgers of Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, and Gil Hodges. Most important, Goodwin describes with eloquence how the Dodgers’ leaving Brooklyn in 1957, and the death of her mother soon after, marked both the end of an era and, for her, the end of childhood.",0684847957,9780684847955),Paperback,,272 pages,"

The Japanese student's father worked in the United States as a doctor, but had to flee to Kyoto to avoid imprisonment in an internment camp. The American soldier has inherited his family's estate in Virginia, where interracial marriage is forbidden. Against such forces, and without the help of their families, how can the love between the young pair — and the future of their child — flourish? The Hidden Flower is an emotionally astute and moving exploration of a taboo love across cultures.",0855945710,9780855945718),Hardcover,,244 pages,"

"," Der Ich-Erzähler verbringt mit seiner Lebensgefährtin die Osterfeiertage bei Freunden in der Steiermark. Zur allgemeinen Heiterkeit gesellt sich am Abend auch das Fernsehprogramm und damit verbunden ""die"" Neuigkeiten des Tages: ""Es wird gegen einen etwa 30jährigen, mittelgroßen Mann ermittelt, der zwei 7 u. 8 Jahre alte Kinder gezwungen hat, sich durch einen Sprung von einem hohen Baum zu töten, und diese Taten mit einer Videokamera aufgenommen hat."" Dieser Mord wird tagesbestimmend für die gesamten Osterfeiertage. Das Fernsehen versorgt sein Publikum mit Berichten und Live-Übertragungen. Interviews mit lokalen Persönlichkeiten werden ausgestrahlt, Bundespräsident und Papst ins rechte Licht gesetzt. Diese Inszenierungen werden in ihrer Perversität noch gesteigert, als ein deutscher Privatsender ankündigt, Ausschnitte aus dem Mordvideo zu senden. Das Medienspektakel findet auch Einzug in die Ferienidylle unserer vier Hauptdarsteller. Neben Osterjause und sportlichen Freizeitvergnügen greifen sie immer wieder zur Fernbedienung und zappen sich durch den News-Dschungel. Fast schon absurd wird ihr Verhalten, als ihnen die Informationsflut der TV-Kanäle nicht mehr ausreicht, und sie aktiv ins Geschehen eingreifen. Die Medien geben Themen vor, und wir richten unser Leben danach ein. Das ist wohl der Fazit des Buches. Für gute Quoten wird über Leichen gegangen, das Publikum erliegt dieser Strategie duch die eigene Sensationslust. Thomas Glavinic beschreibt diese nahezu krankhafte Konsumgier in einer Sprache, die schnörkelloser nicht sein kann. Klar und präzise protokolliert er das unfassbare Verbrechen -- dass darin eine Absicht steckt, macht das Buch spannend bis zum letzten Satz. --Henrike Blum",3423135468,9783423135467),Paperback,,156 pages,"

Bennie Rosato looks exactly like her identical twin, Alice Connolly, but the darkness in Alice's soul makes them two very different women. Or at least that's what Bennie believes, until she finds herself buried alive at the hands of her twin. Meanwhile, Alice takes over Bennie's life, impersonating her at work and even seducing her boyfriend in order to escape the deadly mess she has made of her own life. But Alice underestimates Bennie and the evil she has unleashed in her twin's psyche, as well as Bennie's determination to stay alive long enough to exact revenge.Bennie must face the twisted truth that she is more like her sister Alice than she could have ever imagined, and by the novel's shocking conclusion, Bennie finds herself engaged in a war she cannot win;with herself.",0312380755,9780312380755),Hardcover,,374 pages,"

","From the New York Times bestselling author of The New Revelations and Conversations with God comes a galvanizing vision of spirituality unlike anything you've experienced before....  Humanity is about to create a new form of spirituality on earth. Neale Donald Walsch believes that this New Spirituality will allow humans to express their natural impulse toward the Divine without making one another wrong for the way in which they are doing it...and without killing each other in the name of it. In Tomorrow's God, Walsch offers compelling reasons why adopting this new belief system is in the best interests of humankind -- now. Tomorrow's God contains an astonishing prediction, one that comes from an astonishing source: God. Presented as a conversation between God and Walsch, this startling, profound book is offered in two parts: Part One deals with humanity's current conception of God, and the new ideas about the Deity that will characterize God in our not-too-distant future. Part Two examines how these ideals will be put into place -- and how they will impact our lives, and help us to create a newer, better world.  Controversial, challenging, and illuminating, Tomorrow's God provides both spiritual and down-to-earth advice on what each of us can do to cope with the current world crises -- and experience God in such a way that ourexperience of one another will be healed at last.",0743463048,9780743463041),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","How does a foul-mouthed angel end up as the last hope for all of Heaven and Earth?When Seraph Emma is maimed and tossed from Heaven by a rogue angel who's taken charge, she fears she'll never be allowed to return. Tasked with the impossible job of showing the self-loathing (and not even human!) Jason his worth, Emma is sure she's doomed to fail.Meanwhile, having wormed his way into Heaven, the corrupt Everett has trapped God in Hell and has designs on unleashing evil everywhere. Fortunately, if there's one thing Emma can't do (in addition to minding her language), it's give up. Determined to save Jason and get back to Heaven-even if it means going to Hell-Emma's plan is simple yet impossible: trick the Devil to save God.What she doesn't count on is the devotion and, well, humanity she finds in Jason; the spirit, hidden compassion, and raw sex appeal within the Devil; and the vulnerability of her own heart. With the help of two unlikely allies, she'll wage the battle for Heaven. But will Emma be sidetracked by a new sort of heaven along the way?What's truly more dangerous? Falling from Heaven, or falling in love?",1936305747,9781936305742),Paperback,,194 pages,"

","Easily the most influential book published in the nineteenth century, Darwin’s The Origin of Species is also that most unusual phenomenon, an altogether readable discussion of a scientific subject. On its appearance in 1859 it was immediately recognized by enthusiasts and detractors alike as a work of the greatest importance: its revolutionary theory of evolution by means of natural selection provoked a furious reaction that continues to this day.The Origin of Species is here published together with Darwin’s earlier Voyage of the ‘Beagle.’ This 1839 account of the journeys to South America and the Pacific islands that first put Darwin on the track of his remarkable theories derives an added charm from his vivid description of his travels in exotic places and his eye for the piquant detail.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) ",1400041279,9781400041275),Hardcover,,1024 pages,"

","In the first hours there was nothing, no fear or sadness, just a black and perfect silence.Nando Parrado was unconscious for three days before he woke to discover that the plane carrying his rugby team, as well as their family members and supporters, to an exhibition game in Chile had crashed somewhere deep in the Andes. He soon learned that many were dead or dying—among them his own mother and sister. Those who remained were stranded on a lifeless glacier at nearly 12,000 feet above sea level, with no supplies and no means of summoning help. They struggled to endure freezing temperatures, deadly avalanches, and then the devastating news that the search for them had been called off. As time passed and Nando’s thoughts turned increasingly to his father, who he knew must be consumed with grief, Nando resolved that he must get home or die trying. He would challenge the Andes, even though he was certain the effort would kill him, telling himself that even if he failed he would die that much closer to his father. It was a desperate decision, but it was also his only chance. So Nando, an ordinary young man with no disposition for leadership or heroism, led an expedition up the treacherous slopes of a snow-capped mountain and across forty-five miles of frozen wilderness in an attempt to find help. Thirty years after the disaster Nando tells his story with remarkable candor and depth of feeling. Miracle in the Andes—a first person account of the crash and its aftermath—is more than a riveting tale of true-life adventure: it is a revealing look at life at the edge of death and a meditation on the limitless redemptive power of love.From the Hardcover edition.",140009769X,9781400097692),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","How do I find fulfillment in life? How do I obtain happiness? Despite a multitude of self-help books in recent years, these eternal questions have become increasingly urgent in today’s directionless world. Author Jacques Philippe provides some answers. In his new book, Called to Life, he explains that a complete and fulfilled life is much more assured when we stop trying to chart our own course, when we realize that we are essentially creatures called by God. He goes on to describe where and how these calls take place: the events of life, the Word of God in Scripture, and interior motions of the Holy Spirit. Learning to recognize and follow these calls is what leads to a happy and full life. Called to Life includes a special section on how to read Sacred Scripture prayerfully (Lectio Divina).",1594170940,9781594170942),ebook,,117 pages,"

","In the nineteenth century, the Newfoundland government, under constant pressure from fish merchants, began installing lighthouses in some of the more treacherous places around the island.In the 1950s, Cabot Island boasted a large lighthouse, with a steady, brilliant light and a bellowing foghorn to warn seafarers away from its inviting shoreline. This sentinel of the sea was manned by brothers Alex and Bertram Gill, who hailed from Newtown, a nearby community in Bonavista Bay. In November of 1954, a terrible storm darkened the skies above Cabot Island and battered its solitary lighthouse with a single-minded fury. The keepers of the Cabot Island light were no strangers to sea weather, but when tragedy struck the brothers Gill, the younger of the two was left to fend for himself amid one of the worst storms in Newfoundland’s history. This is a true story of the love between two brothers, a love that perseveres in the face of death, loss, and greatest personal challenge.",1897317034,9781897317037),Paperback,,152 pages,"

","Funny, absurd, satirical, and disturbingthese stories are Horace Walpole's most original, yet least known writingsThese short tales can claim to be the first surrealist writings in English and remain some of the strangest fiction in all literature. They were originally published in 1785 in an edition of six copies, all of which Walpole kept for himself. An extra story is included, which was preserved only in manuscript. Truly bizarre, Walpole's stories defy the fictional conventions of his day, beginning with an often-imitated mock preface explaining that the stories were ""undoubtedly written a little before the creation of the world, and have ever since been preserved, by oral tradition, in the mountains of Crampcraggiri, an uninhabited island, not yet discovered.""",1562790498,9781562790493),Paperback,,113 pages,"

Mankind is free from the age-old misery and poverty that have kept it in bondage, free to create a new world, to explore the universe, to confront the mysteries of human existence. Russia's greatest S-F writeres, Arkday and Boris Strugatsky, have produced a futuristic masterpiece of epic proportions and breathtaking vision.Two interplanetary adventurers hurtle through space at a speed faster than light, and are flung a hundred years into the 22nd century. They find themselves on a planet both like and unlike the earth they abandoned so very long ago--and so recently.It is a planet ruled by wisdom, where automated farms feed tens million inhabitants, where a complete system of moving roads brings the farthest outposts into close communion, where an advanced science in mechanization approaches the mysterious complexity of life itself. Here all effort is bound to the exhilarating art if discovery--way below the planet's waters, deep into the endless reaches of space and far beyond the boundless zones of the human mind.

","“From the Bastille to Baghdad,” The Cartoon History of the World Part 2 is the conclusion (for the moment) of Larry Gonick’s award-winning and bestselling annals of humankind presented in graphic novel form. Picking up after the American Revolution, where Part 1 left off, Part 2 opens with the Enlightenment and rolls across Napoleon, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, World War I and II, and all the way to our recent imbroglios in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Cartoon History of the Modern World Part 2 is a monumental, one might say “historic” achievement, at once edifying, irreverent, and wildly entertaining.

","“You have a very lovely little girl,” breathed the voice on the phone. And just like that, Susan Young is drawn into a living nightmare.A stranger has kidnapped Sue’s daughter, Veda. But he doesn’t want her money, only her suffering–and he will kill Veda if Sue doesn’t follow his every command. With detailed instructions, the faceless abductor leads Sue into a blinding snowstorm on the longest night of the year, to a place she has not traveled to since childhood. The voice on the other end of the line somehow knows Sue’s deepest, most chilling secret–an ominous incident from her past, buried long ago...Across the loneliest back roads of Massachusetts, in the black expanse of a New England winter, Sue is forced to confront her most awful fears as she is met at each step by ever increasing horrors created by a monster who is surely something less than human. In the hope of saving her daughter from a kidnapper whose origin seems darker than anything she could ever have imagined, Sue will discover just how much trauma and fright the human body is capable of absorbing.Set over the course of a single night, Chasing the Dead is a fast-paced, ferociously tense supernatural thriller. With the skill of masters like Dean Koontz and David Morrell, Joe Schreiber has created a tableau of shock and horror, death and destruction, that will draw you in and never let you go.From the Hardcover edition.",0345487478,9780345487476),Hardcover,,196 pages,"

","Well-researched and true to the original myths, each volume in the Goddess Girls series addresses contemporary issues, like friendships and relationships, from a classically accurate—and entertaining—perspective. In Artemis the Brave, Artemis, goddess of the hunt, is always perceived as the bravest goddessgirl at Mount Olympus Academy. What her classmates and best friends don’t realize is that sometimes she isn’t as courageous as she looks. And when Orion—a foreign exchange student from Earth—enters the picture, she is even more nervous than usual! Can Artemis prove to her friends, and herself, that she can live up to her goddess name?",1416982744,9781416982746),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","Michael Merlino lives a charmed life with a successful career, beautiful wife, and beloved son-until his dear father passes away; then things turn strange. Michael can't seem to shake this weird feeling, but maybe he just misses his dad, his mentor. He ignores the feeling that something is wrong.One day, he accidentally kills a stray cat-a sad but everyday sort of accident; he doesn't give it much thought. When another cat appears in Michael's life, however, it makes him wonder whether the stray cat really died, and whether cats actually do have nine lives, as the saying goes. But this isn't your normal stray kitty. This cat is out for revenge. Its spirit wants something from Michael, but what?When a man has everything to lose, however, it's much easier to make it happen-especially when that man is up against what appears to be a supernatural enemy. As Michael begins to face his own demons via a demon cat that won't die, his work begins to slide. His life at home gets more difficult, even with his wife there to support him. Then, there was that note his father left that told Michael to ""drive it."" What did the note mean? Could it possibly have been a warning? The mystery must be solved, as the reincarnated cat keeps getting bigger and meaner, threatening not just Michael's life, but his soul in the bargain.",,,Paperback,First,364 pages,"

",الأسطورة حكاية مقدسة تقليدية، بمعنى أنها انتقلت من جيل إلى جيل، بالرواية الشفهية. مما يجعلها ذاكرة الجماعة التي تحفظ قيمها وعاداتها وطقوسها وحكمتها، وتنقلها للأجيال المتعاقبة، وتكسبها القوة المسيطرة على النفوس. فهي الأداة الأقوى في التثقيف والتطبيع والقناة التي ترسخ من خلالها ثقافة ما وجودها واستمرارها عبر الأجيال وحتى في فترات شيوع الكتابة، لم تفقد الأسطورة الشفهية قوتها وتأثيرها. ذلك أن الألواح الفخارية، كانت محفوظة في المعابد وفي مكتبات الملوك، ولا تلعب إلا دور الحافظ للأسطورة من التحريف بالتناقل. وبقي السمع هو الوسيلة الرئيسية في تداولها. وفي أكثر من مناسبة دورية، كانت الأساطير تتلى أو تنشد في الاحتفالات الدينية العامة، من ذلك مثلاً، أعياد رأس السنة في بابل، حيث كانت تتلى وتمثل أسطورة التكوين البابلية. وأعياد الربيع حيث كانت تتلى وتمثل عذابات الاله تموز. بالإضافة إلى ذلك فإن الأسطورة هي أيضاً نص أدبي، وضع في أبهى حلة فنية ممكنة، واقوى صيغة مؤثرة في النفوس، وهذا ما زاد في سيطرتها وتأثيرها. وكان على الأدب والشعر، أن ينتظرا فترة طويلة، قبل أن ينفصلا عن الأسطورة. لقد وضعت معظم الأساطير السورية والسومرية والبابلية في أجمل شكل شعري ممكن. وقام هوميروس بصياغة معظم أساطير عصره المتداولة، شعراً في الأوديسة والإلياذة. وإلى جانب الشعر والأدب، خلقت الأسطورة فنوناً أخرى كالمسرح الذي ابتدأ عهده بتمثيل الأساطير الرئيسية في الأعياد الدينية. كما دفعت فنوناً أخرى كالغناء والموسيقى وغيرها. وبعد هذا كتاب في أسطورة الشرق القديم، وهو بين يد القارئ في طبعته الثالثة عشرة. وهدف الباحث من وراء كتابه هذا التعريف بالأسطورة في سوريا القديمة وبلاد الرافدين، معتمداً في ذلك على النصوص الكاملة لأهم الأساطير المعروفة والتي تم استحضارها من خلال أكثر من نص وأكثر من ترجمة. وقد كانت براعة الباحث في تقديم كل أسطورة في مناخها العام من الأساطير واضحة حيث أخذت كل أسطورة في هذه الدراسة مكانها في صورة الأساطير ككل، مستمدة تفسيرها من البنية الإجمالية للدراسة. وكان منهجه في تقديم الأساطير يعتمد على جمعها من مجموعات وفق موضوعاتها لا وفق تسلسل زمني أو توزع جغرافي، لأن تفسير أسطورة ما، يبدو عصياً، إذا لم ينظر إليها من خلال منظور شامل، يجمعها مع غيرها من الأساطير التي تعالج نفس الموضوع. وهو منهج جديد في دراسة أساطير المنطقة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك قام الباحث ومن خلال أسفار الكتاب، بمقارنة شاملة مع كتاب التوراة العبرانية، فيما يتعلق بالنصوص الأسطورية الواردة فيه، وذلك لإظهار، مدى اعتماد الثقافة اليهودية على الثقافة السورية والبابلية في صياغة أهم مرجع ديني وثقافي لدى الشعب اليهودي، مظهراً علاقة الأساطير السورية والبابلية بأساطير الشعوب المجاورة كالمصريين والإغريق، متتبعاً ما أمكنه ذلك الأصول الشرقية للأساطير الإغريقية. أما لماذا اقتصر بحثه على سورية وبلاد الرافدين دون بغية ثقافات الشرق القديم، فيوضح الباحث بأن ذلك راجع لأسباب ثلاثة: الأول هو الوحدة الثقافية القائمة في هذا الجزء من المنطقة، هذه الوحدة الثقافية القائمة في هذا الجزء من المنطقة، هذه الوحدة هي التي تعطي لأي بحث يدور حولهما طابع الانسجام والتكامل. والثاني راجع لاتساع الموضوع وتشعبه، مما لا يسمح بدراسة وافية لميثولوجيا الشرق القديم في كتاب واحد ومن قبل مؤلف واحد. أما السبب الثالث فهو يرجع إلى ميل الباحث إلى آداب هذه المنطقة، وولعه بتاريخها وتراثها. وإلى ذلك كان توجه الباحث من خلال كتابه هذا لم يكن إلى زمرة معينة من القراء، بل توجهه كان إلى زمر متعددة فالقارئ العادي يجد فيه موضوعاً جديداً على الكتابات العربية الحديثة، لأنه أول كتاب يعالج موضوع الأسطورة على هذا المستوى من الإحاطة. وسيجد القارئ المطلع كثيراً من المعلومات الجديدة والتفسيرات الجديدة. كما سيجد المهتمون بالديانات المقارنة عدداً لا بأس به من النقاط القابلة للدراسة والمناقشة، وكذلك الأمر فيما يتعلق بدارسي الآداب والديانة اليهودية. أما بالنسبة للمتخصصين، فيأمل الباحث أن تفتح النظرات والأفكار الجديدة التي طرحها في ثنايا هذا الكتاب، مجالاً لحوارات مجدية.,,,Paperback,13th Edition,386 pages,"

The battleground is the human brain.  And there are no stalemates here:  It’s victory . . . or madness.BZRK unfolds with hurricane force around core themes of conspiracy and mystery, insanity and changing realities, engagement and empowerment, and the larger impact of personal choice.

","A literary sports classic, finally available in the U.S. Originally published in the Netherlands in 1978, The Rider became an instant cult classic, selling over 100,000 copies. Brilliantly conceived and written at a breakneck pace, it is a loving, imaginative, and, above all, passionate tribute to the art of bicycle road racing.  Not a dry history of the sport, The Rider is beloved as a bicycle odyssey, a literary masterpiece that describes in painstaking detail one 150-kilometer race in a mere 150 pages. We are, every inch of the way, inside amateur biker Tim Krabbé's head as his mind churns at top speed along with his furious peddling. Privy to his every thought-on the glory and vagaries of the sport itself, the weather, the characters and lineage of his rival cyclists, almost hallucinogenic anecdotes about great riders of the past-the book progresses kilometer by kilometer, thought by thought, and the reader is left breathless and exhilarated.  A thrillingly realistic look at what it is like to compete in a road race, The Rider is the ultimate book for bike lovers as well as the arm-chair sports enthusiast. Author Biography: Tim Krabbé is one of Holland's leading writers, and his novels are published all over the world. His many books include The Vanishing, which was made into a successful film, and The Cave. He lives in Amsterdam.",1582342903,9781582342900),Paperback,,152 pages,"

","Desde millones de fotos, carteles, vídeos, camisetas, postales, discos, libros, frases, testimonios —fantasmas todos ellos de la sociedad industrial, que no sabe depositar sus mitos en la sobriedad de la memoria—, el Che nos vigila. Más allá de toda parafernalia, retorna. Casi treinta años después de su muerte, su imagen cruza generaciones, su mito persigue los delirios de grandeza del neoliberalismo. Irreverente, burlón, terco —moralmente terco—, el Che siempre será motivo de debate.Con abundante material hasta ahora inédito —fotos, testimonios, diarios…—, Ernesto Guevara, también conocido como el Che es una biografía minuciosa y detallada que nos revela a un personaje diferente del que creemos conocer; un hombre que, siendo ministro de Industria en Cuba, jamás terminaba de amarrarse las botas. Es un encuentro con Ernesto Guevara, más allá del Che, pero también una reelaboración del mito.

","The smart and sassy detective Zephyr Zuckerman is now armed and undercover in a Greenwich Village hotel where mysteries—from garbage-grabbing guests to the reservation system—lurk around every corner.    Now working as a junior detective with the New York City Special Investigations Commission, Zephyr’s gone incognito as a concierge to find out who laundered a hundred grand off the hotel books—and why. But the discovery of a prone, flush-faced guest gasping for air in room 502 only hints at the sinister goings-on inside this funky establishment. While the rapid response of the fire department leads to a sweaty date with a smooth-talking, rock-climbing rescue worker, Zephyr finds herself even more hot and bothered by an attempted murder on her watch. Could the smart-mouthed Japanese yenta across the hall know more than she’s telling? How are cryptic phone calls from a mysterious corporation linked to the victim in 502? Under pressure and overwhelmed, Zephyr soon finds that a concierge cover is no protection in a place where crime, like the city itself, never sleeps.",0385342705,9780385342704),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Fans of Jean Mead's first novel in the Widow Makers series will love this, the second in the saga of the mining Standish family. Set in the mid-nineteenth century, it continues the tale of the family's fortune in the slate quarries of north Wales.The eldest son Tommy Standish is now the hard and ruthless manager of the Garddryn Quarry, while his father Joe and younger brother Frank are quarrymen. The family find themselves pitted against each other as Joe fights for fairer working conditions and pay for his fellow workers, while Tommy is determined to grind every last bit of sweat and toil out of them to further his own ambitions and wealth.A nasty character through and through, Tommy treats everyone equally badly - from his depressed and opium-addicted wife Henrietta to his young son Edward and his parents, who remind him of his embarrassingly humble upbringing. You find yourself caught up in the struggles of those he is oppressing, hoping that his scheming will be foiled and that someone will stand up to him, as Jean Mead sweeps you along with her vivid descriptions of nineteenth-century life and the harshness and beauty of Snowdonia. A compelling vivid account that leaves you finishing the last page with regret and hoping for more!HELENA EARNSHAW REVIEW FOR THE WELSH BOOKS COUNCIL. www.gwales.com",1907424148,9781907424144),Paperback,,,"

","In this book Dr. Tomislav Sunic describes the origins and dynamics of America's founding myths. Quoting and translating from many long-forgotten or suppressed sources from the fields of literature, history, anthropology and philosophy, the book represents an interdisciplinary compendium dealing with the topic of Americanism. The genealogy of early Calvinist Puritanism mixed with the techno-scientific religion of boundless economic progress and legally veiled in the obscure para-Biblical and Jewish-inspired sense of political self-chosenness, created a system that has little in common with its original design. Postmodern Americanism, with its abstract theories of multiculturalism and its global desire for world improvement, turned America into a menacing and self-destructive continent that puts not only the survival of America's European heritage at risk, but threatens the heritage of other peoples worldwide as well.",1419659847,9781419659843),Paperback,,254 pages,"

","New York City, 1847: A madman is on the loose. Someone is committing murders in the manner of Edgar Allan Poe's tales of terror. The police are stymied. When a corpse is found interred in a masonry wall in a subterranean chamber, they call on Poe himself to help solve the crime. Edgar Allan Poe's fictional detective, C. Auguste Dupin, has made the author famous as the master of deductive reasoning. But when ""the father of the detective story"" applies his powers of discovery to the ""Poe Murders"", he finds that the clues lead in only one direction: to Poe himself. Poe soon becomes the prime suspect, and he begins to doubt his own sanity as the evidence piles up against him. What of his somnambulistic trances that often find him at the graveside of his late wife, Virginia? Or the bizarre raven that visits him in his Fordham cottage? The strange mark on his neck? The odd behavior of his one-eyed cat, Pluto? And what of his doctor, Coppelius — he of the bulging pale blue eye — and his beautiful, other-worldly daughter, Olimpia? Nothing is as it seems.As the police tighten their noose around Poe's neck, he races against time to solve the crimes and clear his name. But he soon finds himself confronting horrors that not even his macabre fiction could have envisioned — and a conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of reality itself.Prepare yourself for a wild ride. This is not your father's Edgar Allan Poe. This Poe's packin' heat...",,,Kindle Edition,,241 pages,"

","Pushkin’s prose tales are the foundation stones on which the great novels of Turgenev, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky were built, but they are also brilliant and fascinating in their own right. In both prose and verse, Pushkin was one of the world’s great storytellers: direct and dramatic, clear-sighted, vivid, and passionate.This new and expanded Everyman’s edition of his stories includes all the mature work. In addition to such novella-length masterpieces as The Captain’s Daughter and The Tales of Belkin the collection now contains many more short pieces and the masterly History of Pugachev, a powerful account of the man who rebelled against Catherine the Great.",0375405496,9780375405495),Hardcover,,603 pages,"

","Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, this is a hefty, truly comprehensive guide to the theory and healing power of Chinese medicine. It's also a primer on nutrition--including facts about green foods, such as spirulina and blue-green algae, and the ""regeneration diets"" used by cancer patients and arthritics--along with an inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes.The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, so you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing ""sweet"" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!)Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds ""healing, awareness, and peace"" from following his program. The diet is certainly acetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these ""negative energy"" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he adds dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation (thyroid and immune-system problems may result; fluoride is a carcinogen). There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out.",1556434308,9781556434303),Paperback,Third Edition,784 pages,"

","Kyle MacDonald had a paperclip. One red paperclip, a dream, and a resume to write. And bills to pay. Oh, and a very patient girlfriend who was paying the rent while he was once again “between jobs.” Kyle wanted to be able to provide for himself and his girlfriend, Dominique. He wanted to own his own home. He wanted something bigger than a paperclip. So he put an ad on Craigslist, the popular classifieds website, with the intention of trading that paperclip for something better. A girl in Vancouver offered him a fish pen in exchange for his paperclip. He traded the fish pen for a doorknob and the doorknob for a camping stove. Before long he had traded the camping stove for a generator for a neon sign. Not long after that, avid snow-globe collector and television star Corbin Bernsen and the small Canadian town of Kipling were involved, and Kyle was on to bigger and better things. In One Red Paperclip, Kyle takes you on a journey around the globe as he moves from paperclip holder to homeowner in just fourteen trades. With plenty of irreverent and insightful anecdotes and practical tips on how you can find your own paperclip and realize your dreams, he proves it’s possible to succeed in life and achieve your dreams on your own terms. Quirky and inspirational, this story of a regular guy and a small, red, now-legendary paperclip will have you looking at your office supplies-and your life-in a whole new way.",0307353168,9780307353160),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","RM Johnson, the Essence bestselling author of Dating Games and The Harris Family, delivers an absorbing and provocative new novel about the lowdown schemes and broken dreams that follow a fractured marriage.Successful business entrepreneur Nate Kenny is thrilled to marry the beautiful and intelligent Monica, chiefly because it means he can at last fulfill his lifelong dream of having a family. While he isn't happy about it, he agrees with Monica to wait three years before trying for pregnancy. Once those three years are up and the couple discovers that she is unable to bear children, any love he once felt for Monica is gone, and Nate wants out of the marriage. But he’s worried about losing half of his sixty-million-dollar fortune in a divorce settlement. Desperate for an out, he searches for a way to exploit the infidelity clause in the couple’s prenuptial agreement.Enter Lewis Waters. With his baby's mother addicted to drugs, Lewis is already seriously down on his luck when he accidentally smashes his car into Nate’s Bentley. Without auto insurance or any way to pay for the repairs, Lewis is at the end of his financial rope. But the scheming Nate sees another way for the attractive young man to repay his debt: as sexual bait for Monica. And so Nate sets up Lewis with all of the accessories he believes Lewis will need to earn Monica's love, or at the very least, her lust: a big house, a fancy car, expensive clothes, and a full bank account. But as is often the case when it comes to matters of the heart, things don’t unfold according to plan. When Monica falls hard for Lewis, Nate panics—was protecting his fortune more important than trying to save his marriage? As he finds himself overwhelmed by second thoughts, Nate is willing to do anything to get Monica back.An inspired fusion of realism and romance, The Million Dollar Divorce is an unpredictable caper of lust, betrayal, and family ties.",0743258177,9780743258173),Paperback,,304 pages,"

Her tragic murder, at the young age of twenty-three, stripped the world of her talent and boundless potential, her tightly knit family of their beloved angel, and her husband, Chris Perez, of the greatest love he had ever known.For over a decade, Chris held on to the only personal thing he had left from his late wife: the touching and sometimes painful memories of their very private bond. Now, for the first time, Chris opens up about their unbreakable friendship, forbidden relationship, and blossoming marriage, which were cut short by Selena’s unforgivable death.Chris’s powerful story gives a rare glimpse into Selena’s sincerity and vulnerability when falling in love, strength and conviction when fighting for that love, and absolute resilience when finding peace and normalcy with her family’s acceptance of the only man she called her husband. While showcasing a side of Selena that has never been disclosed before and clarifying certain misconceptions about her life and death, To Selena, with Love is an everlasting love story that immortalizes the heart and soul of an extraordinary, unforgettable, and irreplaceable icon.",,,Hardcover,,304 pages,"

?There were times I was a bit reticent in taking out my camera, like when some ?old friends? stopped by to hang out. I didn?t want to intrude on these moments, but John insisted. He felt that I captured him in ways that no one else did because of his comfort level with me?For years, only my closest friends got to see these photos?which were literally tucked away in a shoebox in my closet. They were surprised that these images did not convey the John that was portrayed in the press during our time together. In fact, they saw a side of John seldom seen.??From INSTAMATIC KARMA
John Lennon is the most famously photographed Beatle?everyone from Iain MacMillian to Annie Lebowitz took iconic images of him?but there have never been pictures of him like these taken by May Pang, Lennon?s girlfriend from 1973 to 1975. In INSTAMATIC KARMA, they?re collected for the first time. With very few exceptions, these photos are that rare thing: never-before-seen images of an icon. The photos here show Lennon in a variety of settings: at work, at play, at home, and away. They show a playful Lennon, a casual, unguarded Lennon; they?re the kind of photos one lover takes of another. May has written rich captions to accompany her photos--taken together, they tell a simple story of the time May and Lennon spent together; a time, according to legend, when Lennon was unhappy and unproductive, estranged from his family and bandmates. Pang?s photos clearly tell another story?they show Lennon clowning around, working on his hit album ?Walls and Bridges?, embracing old friends and family, hanging out in their apartment on Manhattan?s East 52nd Street, relaxing in the country in upstate New York or spending peaceful days swimming in the waters of Long Island. 
The photographs in INSTAMATIC KARMA are both color and black & white, casual Polaroids and more composed shots. Each one is an intimate glimpse into a fascinating time in John Lennon?s life.

","Should cyberspace be regulated? How can it be done? It's a cherished belief of techies and net denizens everywhere that cyberspace is fundamentally impossible to regulate. Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig warns that, if we're not careful we'll wake up one day to discover that the character of cyberspace has changed from under us. Cyberspace will no longer be a world of relative freedom; instead it will be a world of perfect control where our identities, actions, and desires are monitored, tracked, and analyzed for the latest market research report. Commercial forces will dictate the change, and architecture—the very structure of cyberspace itself—will dictate the form our interactions can and cannot take. Code And Other Laws of Cyberspace is an exciting examination of how the core values of cyberspace as we know it—intellectual property, free speech, and privacy-—are being threatened and what we can do to protect them. Lessig shows how code—the architecture and law of cyberspace—can make a domain, site, or network free or restrictive; how technological architectures influence people's behavior and the values they adopt; and how changes in code can have damaging consequences for individual freedoms. Code is not just for lawyers and policymakers; it is a must-read for everyone concerned with survival of democratic values in the Information Age.",0465039146,9780465039142),Paperback,,416 pages,"

They had been best friends since they were six, spending hot Minneapolis summers and cold Minneapolis winters together, dreaming of Hogwarts and Oz, superheroes and baseball. Now that they were eleven, it was weird for a boy and a girl to be best friends. But they couldn't help it - Hazel and Jack fit, in that way you only read about in books. And they didn't fit anywhere else. And then, one day, it was over. Jack just stopped talking to Hazel. And while her mom tried to tell her that this sometimes happens to boys and girls at this age, Hazel had read enough stories to know that it's never that simple. And it turns out, she was right. Jack's heart had been frozen, and he was taken into the woods by a woman dressed in white to live in a palace made of ice. Now, it's up to Hazel to venture into the woods after him. Hazel finds, however, that these woods are nothing like what she's read about, and the Jack that Hazel went in to save isn't the same Jack that will emerge. Or even the same Hazel.Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Snow Queen,"" Breadcrumbs is a story of the struggle to hold on, and the things we leave behind.",0062015052,9780062015051),Hardcover,,312 pages,"

And what is the Anderson sisters' connection to another set of twin girls, Viola and Sorrel Quinton, born in London on 1st January 1900?

","Nadat haar man is gestorven verliest een jonge vrouw de draad van haar leven, haar huis, de voogdij over haar kind, ja, zelfs haar spraak..À bout de ressources, après plusieurs mois passés dans la rue, Marie part vivre à la campagne. Elle laisse à Paris sa fille de cinq ans, Nisa, placée dans une institution. Depuis la mort de son mari, elle vit dans le chagrin et la solitude. Elle était poète, elle n'écrit plus. Isolée dans une petite maison, elle ne pense qu'à récupérer sa fille. Elle va vivre une ultime épreuve, la perte des mots. Elle ne sait plus parler, ne peut plus s'exprimer...L'écriture limpide et élégante d'Isabelle Jarry, son regard aigu et sensible sur les êtres et la nature est un des charmes de ce beau roman qui traite de la perte d'un être aimé et de ce qui donne son sens à la vie. Mais ce livre est aussi la critique d'une société où le lien social s'est délité, où la création est en danger, où le sens se dilue et l'espoir s'amenuise.",2070307646,9782070307647),Paperback,Collection Folio n° 4427,203 pages,"

","First published in 1525, Martin Luther's ""Bondage of the Will"" is acknowledged by theologians as one of the great masterpieces of the Reformation. It is Luther's response to Desiderius Erasmus's ""Diatribe on Free Will, "" written in his direct and unique style, combining deep spirituality with humor. Luther writes powerfully about man's depravity and God's sovereignty. The crucial issue for Luther concerned what ability free will has, and to what degree it is subject to God's sovereignty. For Luther, this key issue of free will is directly connected to God's plan of salvation. Is man able to save himself, or is his salvation entirely a work of divine grace? This work is vital to understanding the primary doctrines of the Reformation and will long remain among the great theological classics of Christian history.",0800753429,9780800753429),Paperback,,322 pages,"

","Healthcare Kaizen focuses on the principles and methods of daily continuous improvement, or Kaizen, for healthcare professionals and organizations. Kaizen is a Japanese word that means ""change for the better,"" as popularized by Masaaki Imai in his 1986 book Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success and through the books of Norman Bodek, both of whom contributed introductory material for this book.Winner of a 2013 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award!In 1989, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, endorsed the principles of Kaizen in the New England Journal of Medicine, describing it as ""the continuous search for opportunities for all processes to get better."" This book shows how to make this goal a reality.Healthcare Kaizen shares some of the methods used by numerous hospitals around the world, including Franciscan St. Francis Health, where co-author Joe Swartz has led these efforts. Most importantly, the book covers the management mindsets and philosophies required to make Kaizen work effectively in a hospital department or as an organization-wide program. All of the examples in the book were shared by leading healthcare organizations, with over 200 full-color pictures and visual illustrations of Kaizen-based improvements that were initiated by nurses, physicians, housekeepers, senior executives and other staff members at all levels.Healthcare Kaizen will be helpful for organizations that have embraced weeklong improvement events, but now want to follow the lead of ThedaCare, Virginia Mason Medical Center, and others who have moved beyond just doing events into a more complete management system based on Lean or the Toyota Production System. It's often said, without much reflection, that people hate change. The experiences shared in this book prove that people actually love change when they are fully engaged in the process, get to make improvements that improve patient care and make their day less frustrating, and when they don't fear being laid off as a result of their improvements.Mark Graban explains why his new book Healthcare Kaizen is a great resource for healthcare organizations looking to make improvements on the frontlines.(www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4JdaH03Dbo&a...)

","Three narratives, set in the fifth, fourteenth, and twentieth centuries, all revolving around an ancient text and each with a love story at its center, are the elements of this ingenious novel, a follow-up to the bestselling, An Instance Of The Fingerpost.""May well be the best historical mystery ever written,"" proclaimed The Sunday Boston Globe about Iain Pears's An Instance of the Fingerpost, while Booklist called its publication ""a major literary event."" Iain Pears's international bestseller was greeted with front-page reviews (""A crafty, utterly mesmerizing intellectual thriller""--The Washington Post Book World), named a New York Times Notable Book, and hailed as a Book to Remember by the New York Public Library. Now he returns with a greatly anticipated novel that is so brilliantly constructed, the author himself describes it as ""a complexity."" The centuries are the fifth (the final days of the Roman Empire); the fourteenth (the years of the Black Death); and the twentieth (World War II). The setting for each is the same--Provence--and each has at its heart a love story. The narratives intertwine seamlessly, but what joins them thematically is an ancient text--""The Dream of Scipio""--a work of neo-Platonism that poses timeless philosophical questions. What is the obligation of the individual in a society under siege? What is the role of learning when civilization itself is threatened, whether by acts of man or nature? Does virtue lie more in engagement or in neutrality?

","La vita di Gerald Durrell, come ben sanno i suoi numerosi e affezionati lettori, è un continuo alternarsi di viaggi alla ricerca di animali da catturare e di soggiorni nell’Isola di Jersey, dove con gli anni è riuscito a creare un celebre parco zoologico. In questo libro, apparso per la prima volta nel 1961 e diventato nel frattempo uno dei suoi più popolari, Durrell si trova alle prese con nuove e spesso comiche avventure, fra lui e gli animali, in luoghi remoti dell’America del Sud. Pipistrelli e pinguini, elefanti marini e armadilli, oltre a una notevole fauna umana, osservata con l’occhio ironico del viaggiatore, saranno qui i protagonisti. E fra questi non bisognerà dimenticare una famiglia di volpi che danza graziosamente con un rotolo di carta igienica, nonché il tapiro Claudius che succhia rumorosamente una possente catena e poi, trascinandosela dietro come fosse un fantasma, irrompe fra gli invitati a una cena della buona società di Buenos Aires, come un sereno devastatore.",8845902870,9788845902871),Paperback,Piccola Biblioteca #213,277 pages,"

","What transformed a frontier bully into the seventh president of the United States? A southerner obsessed with personal honor who threatened his enemies with duels to the death, a passionate man who fled to Spanish Mississippi with the love of his life before she was divorced, Andrew Jackson of Tennessee left a vast personal correspondence detailing his stormy relationship with the world of early America. He helped shape the American personality, yet he remains largely unknown to most modern readers. Now historian Andrew Burstein (The Inner Jefferson, America’s Jubilee) brings back Jackson with all his audacity and hot-tempered rhetoric. Most people vaguely imagine Andrew Jackson as a jaunty warrior and man of the people, when he was much more: a power monger whom voters thought they could not do without—a man just as complex and controversial as Jefferson or Lincoln. Declared a national hero upon his stunning victory over the British at the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, this uncompromising soldier capitalized on his fame and found the presidency within his grasp.Yet Burstein shows that Jackson had conceived no political direction for the country. He was virtually uneducated, having grown up in a backwoods settlement in the Carolinas. His ambition to acquire wealth and achieve prominence was matched only by his confidence that he alone could restore virtue to American politics. As the “people’s choice,” this model of masculine bravado—tall, gaunt, and sickly through-out his career—persevered. He lost the election of 1824 on a technicality, owing to the manipulations of Henry Clay. Jackson partisans ran him again, with a vengeance, so that he became, from 1829 to 1837, a president bent on shaping the country to his will. Over two terms, he secured a reputation for opposing the class of moneyed men. To his outspoken critics, he was an elected tyrant.Burstein gives us our first major reevaluation of Jackson’s life in a generation. Unlike the extant biographies, Burstein’s examines Jackson’s close relationships, discovering how the candidate advanced his political chances through a network of army friends—some famous, like Sam Houston, who became a hero himself; others, equally important, who have been lost to history until now. Yet due to his famous temper, Jackson ultimately lost his closest confidants to the opposition party.The Passions of Andrew Jackson includes a fresh interpretation of Jackson’s role in the Aaron Burr conspiracy and offers a more intimate view of the backcountry conditions and political setting that shaped the Tennessean’s controversial understanding of democracy. This is the dynamic story of a larger-than-life American brought down to his authentic earthiness and thoughtfully demythologized. In a provocative conclusion, Burstein relates Jackson to the presidents with whom he was and still is often compared, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.",0375414282,9780375414282),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

Não qualquer início, evidente. Sou muito inovador espírito, é bom que se saiba. E não só muito como muitíssimo. De tal maneira que este relato nada tem de biográfico. Qualquer palerma pode biografar-se, mérito nenhum há nisto. Inventa-se um pouco aqui, romanceia-se um pouco acolá, e pronto, qualquer um faz supimpa figura. Não me é o caso. Não que não faça supimpa figura; refiro-me à patetice que é uma biografia. Gostava, antes, que os senhores tomassem estas linhas por uma necrografia. Sim, uma necrografia. Obscura-lhes, o termo?... Pois lhes aclaro o significado: uma necrografia, meus senhores, é a história de uma defuntice. Não a história de quem foi o defunto em vida, que isto seria uma biografia. Falo do defunto, defunto. Ou melhor, não do defunto, defunto, carcaça abominável e tenebrosa que as gentes têm o excelente costume de enfiar terra abaixo. Esta tem sempre a mesma história. Enterram-na, e apressa-se a apodrecer.”",,,,1,64 pages,"

","Το μυθιστόρημα-ντοκουμέντο για τη δολοφονία του Γρηγόρη Λαμπράκη (1963). Ένα βιβλίο-σύμβολο τα χρόνια της δικτατορίας, ένα μυθιστόρημα-σταθμός στην ελληνική λογοτεχνία. Γραμμένο εν θερμώ από το συγγραφέα σχεδόν παράλληλα με την εξέλιξη των γεγονότων και της δίκης που συντάραξε την Ελλάδα, το ""Ζ"" εκδόθηκε για πρώτη φορά στα μέσα της ταραγμένης δεκαετίας του 1960.""Λογοτεχνικό ρεπορτάζ"" ή ""φανταστικό ντοκιμαντέρ ενός εγκλήματος"" για τον ίδιο τον Βασίλη Βασιλικό, το ""Ζ"" κινείται στα όρια μεταξύ λογοτεχνίας και δημοσιογραφίας με το συγγραφέα να ενορχηστρώνει τα επίσημα ντοκουμέντα της υπόθεσης Λαμπράκη. Ο Βασίλης Βασιλικός εξηγεί: ""Είναι κάτι ανάλογο με το χαρακτηρισμό -μη μυθιστορηματικό μυθιστόρημα- 'non fiction novel' που λανσάρισε στο ""Εν Ψυχρώ"" ο Τρούμαν Καπότε. Σημαίνει, με άλλα λόγια, μια περίπτωση, που θα ήταν, κάτω από άλλες περιστάσεις, φανταστική ή μυθιστορηματική αλλά συμβαίνει να ’ναι εκατό τα εκατό πραγματική και μη μυθιστορηματική. Δηλαδή το Ζ υπακούει στους νόμους ενός έργου φαντασίας, έχει δική του νομοτέλεια, αυτόνομη, μόνο που τυχαίνει όλα αυτά να μην είναι διόλου φανταστικά, αλλά μια πιστή και υπεύθυνη αντιγραφή της πραγματικότητας"" (1966).",,,Paperback,,512 pages,"

Living rather too closely across the valley is Rupert Campbell-Black, divorced and as dissolute as ever, and now the Tory Minister for Sport.Declan needs only a few days at Corinium to realise that the Managing Director, Lord Baddingham, is a crook who has recruited him merely to help retain the franchise for Corinium. Baddingham has also enticed Cameron Cook, a gorgeous but domineering woman executive, to produce Declan's programme. Declan and Cameron detest each other, provoking a storm of controversy into which Rupert plunges with his usual abandon.As a rival group emerges to pitch for the franchise, reputations ripen and decline, true love blossoms and burns, marriages are made and shattered, and sex raises its (delicious) head at almost every throw as, in bed and boardroom, the race is on to capture the Cotswold Crown.",055215637X,9780552156370),Paperback,,716 pages,"

Previously thought to be normal people from Earth, the father and daughters had been magically transported to the land of Mythrania where they successfully battled the Scelestus, the evil entity bent on domination of the entire universe—or was it successful? In Book II, Paul is dead, murdered while rescuing Fraya from the clutches of the malignant Scelestus. Torn with grief, both Ameca and Fraya jump at the chance to bring their father back to life. Seeking the guidance of Menindus, the ancient Magi tells the girls they must leave Mythrania and return to their own world, taking three companions with them on a quest to recover a powerful magical artefact that has the ability to return the dead to life or make the living immortal.But all is not as they left it on their world. Their mother has been abducted—and so have they—according to the newspapers. The girls must contend with the police, who are trying to “rescue” them; Lord Bellatrix, the High Priest of the Scelestus, who is implementing a plan to enslave humanity; and the immortal Rex-Ultar, who has been waiting for them ever since Menindus killed his father, centuries ago. While they are occupied on their quest, the Scelestus’ agents continue their work to dominate the Kingdoms of Mythrania by infecting the population with a disease that turns them into almost indestructible, flesh-eating monsters.Can Ameca, Fraya and their companions recover the artefact and stop Bellatrix, rescue their mother and return to Mythrania to restore their father to life before the Kingdoms are overrun and the Scelestus returns triumphant?Look out evil...here come the girls...again.AMECA J AND THE LEGACY OF MENINDUS - Part I of the Ameca J Chronicles - releasing 10/09/12AMECA J AND THE REVENGE OF REX-ULTAR - Part II of the Ameca J Chronicles - releasing 12/13/12AMECA J AND THE DEMON GOD OF MYTHRANIA - Part III of the Ameca J Chronicles - releasing early 2013",,,Paperback,,273 pages,"

The Nightmare--What the  public did not see was Anna Marie Duke, a young girl  whose life changed forever at age seven when  tyrannical mangers stripped her of nearly all that was  familiar, beginning with her name. She was deprived  of family and friends. Her every word was  programmed, her every action monitored and criticized. She  was fed liquor and prescription drugs, taught to  lie to get work, and relentlessly drilled to win  roles. The Legend--Out of this nightmare emerged  Patty Duke, a show business legend still searching  for the child, Anna. She won three Emmy Awards and  divorced three husbands. A starring role in  Valley of the Dolls nearly ruined her  career. She was notorious for wild spending sprees,  turbulent liaisons, and an uncontrollable temper.  Until a long hidden illness was diagnosed, and her  amazing recovery recovery began. The Triumph--  Call Me Anna is an American success  story that grew out of a bizarre and desperate  struggle for survival. A harrowing, ultimately  triumphant story told by Patty Duke herself--wife,  mother, political activist, President of the Screen  Actors Guild, and at last, a happy, fulfilled woman  whose miracle is her own life.",0553272055,9780553272055),Paperback,,311 pages,"

","On a scorching June Sunday in 1876, thousands of Indian warriors - Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho - converged on a grassy ridge above the valley of Montana's Little Bighorn River. On the ridge five companies of United States cavalry - 262 soldiers, comprising officers and troopers - fought desperately but hopelessly. When the guns fell silent, no soldier - including their commanding officer, Lt Col. George Armstrong Custer - had survived. Custer's Last Stand is among the most enduring events in American history - 130 years after the fact, books continue to be written and people continue to argue about even the most basic details surrounding the Little Bighorn. Evan S. Connell, whom Joyce Carol Oates has described as 'one of our most interesting and intelligent American writers', wrote what continues to be the most reliable - and compulsively readable - account of the subject. Connell makes good use of his research and novelist's eye for story and detail to re-create the heroism, foolishness and savagery of this crucial chapter in the history of the West.",0330293400,9780330293402),Paperback,,441 pages,"

","As an artist and persona, Jim Morrison epitomized the late 1960s, bridging a burgeoning counterculture and popular culture, while acting out the iconoclastic rage, rampant libido, and spectacular flameout of a tumultuous era. The music he created with The Doors has sold over 50 million records worldwide—with over 13 million in the last decade alone, as their songs have been embraced by a new generation. But despite Morrison’s seminal importance, there has not yet been an authoritative biography that does justice to him and his creative legacy. Until now. Stephen Davis, the preeminent rock biographer and author of the classic Led Zeppelin history Hammer of the Gods (over 600,000 copies sold in three editions, and a #1 New York Times bestseller), has uncovered never-before-seen documents, conducted dozens of original interviews, and scoured Morrison’s unpublished journals and recordings to write the definitive biography of a misunderstood legend. Jim Morrison is packed with startling new revelations about every phase of his life and career, from his troubled youth in a strict military household to his blossoming as a rock icon among the avant-garde LA scene to his voracious drug abuse and secret sexual experiments. Davis also investigates one of the greatest mysteries in rock history—the circumstances surrounding Morrison’s mysterious and unsolved death—as he pieces together new evidence to tell the true and heartbreaking story of Morrison’s last tragic days in Paris. Compelling and unforgettable, Jim Morrison is destined to become a classic.",1592400647,9781592400645),Hardcover,,496 pages,"

","The broadcast interview of a young computer prodigy attracts the attention of aliens aboard an interstellar trading ship. The kidnapping of Tommy (and his cat) begins an adventure among the stars, a coming of age story entangled with computers, faster-than-light travel, a dying civilization, and an ancient evil.On board the five-thousand-meter starship, he meets a crew of humans, descended from peasants, priests, and soldiers taken from Earth a thousand years before. He soon learns that all are slaves to the seldom-seen aliens inhabiting the upper third of the ship. His first months are spent in mindless work that he later learns is meant to domesticate his “feral” nature.Eventually, he is introduced to the reason for his kidnapping: Tommy is expected to replace the ancient and failing computers on the ship with computers taken from Earth, beginning with the long-dead missile controller, without which the ship is defenseless. After the new missile controller, with Tommy as its operator, successfully defends the ship against attack, his “benefactor,” one of the alien Nesu masters, directs him to replace the environmental and navigation computers. This work leads to revelations that the star drive is from still another alien group -- called the Guardians by the Nesu -- who, fifteen hundred years before, destroyed the Nesu home world and now block all scientific advancement in the local arm of the galaxy.Tommy’s determination to return to his family expands to include returning all the human slaves to Earth, using his control of the computers that now run the ship. With the help of a Nesu mathematician, will he also find a way to free the Nesu from their enthrallment by the Guardians and protect the Earth from the fate of the Nesu home world?",,,Nook,,0 pages,"

","Study hard, do well on your assessment, and you'll be rewarded. The phrase had been repeated throughout Alexandria's life. A person's rank on their assessment test determined everything. Their job, where they lived, and even who they could marry. At least that's what Alexandria thought before she received the results. Alexandria's assessment elevates her to fast-tracker status, but Byron, her best friend turned true love, isn't as lucky. His results sink him to the lowest possible rank and a guaranteed life of hardship and misery. Everything Alexandria believed is a lie. Fast-trackers run the country. Anger one of them and your whole world could fall apart. Anger one of them and the people you love suffer. Disillusioned, Alexandria plunges herself into the fast-tracker's world in hopes of helping Byron. But can she help Byron before she completely loses herself to the allure of their lifestyle?",1463778198,9781463778194),Paperback,,262 pages,"

","Simple Justice is generally regarded as the classic account of the U.S. Supreme Court’s epochal decision outlawing racial segregation and the centerpiece of African-Americans’ ongoing crusade for equal justice under law.The 1954 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Brown v. Board of Education brought centuries of legal segregation in this country to an end. It was and remains, beyond question, one of the truly significant events in American history, “probably the most important American government act of any kind since the Emancipation Proclamation,” in the view of constitutional scholar Louis H. Pollak. The Brown decision climaxed a long, torturous battle for black equality in education, making hard law out of vague principles and opening the way for the broad civil rights upheavals of the 1960s and beyond.Simple Justice is the story of that battle. Richard Kluger traces the background of the epochal decision, from its remote legal and cultural roots to the complex personalities of those who brought about its realization. The result is a landmark work of popular history, graceful and fascinatingly detailed, the panoramic account of a struggle for human dignity in process since the birth of the nation.Here is the human drama, told in all its dimensions, of the many plaintiffs, men, women, and children, variously scared or defiant but always determined, who made the hard decision to proceed – bucking the white power structure in Topeka, Kansas; braving night riders in rural South Carolina; rallying fellow high school students in strictly segregated Prince Edward County, Virginia – and at a dozen other times and places showing their refusal to accept defeat.Here, too, is the extraordinary tale, told for the first time, of the black legal establishment, forced literally to invent itself before it could join the fight, then patiently assembling, in courtroom after courtroom, a body of law that would serve to free its people from thralldom to unjust laws. Heroes abound, some obscure, like Charles Houston (who built Howard Law School into a rigorous academy for black lawyers) and the Reverend J.A. DeLaine (the minister-teacher who, despite bitter opposition, organized and led the first crucial fight for educational equality in the Jim Crow South), others like Thurgood Marshall, justly famous – but all of whose passionate devotion proved intense enough to match their mission.Reading Simple Justice, we see how black Americans’ groundswell urge for fair treatment collides with the intransigence of white supremacists in a grinding legal campaign that inevitably found its way to the halls and chambers of the Supreme Court for a final showdown. Kluger searches out and analyzes what went on there during the months of hearings and deliberations, often behind closed doors, laying bare the doubts, disagreements, and often deeply held convictions of the nine Justices. He shows above all how Chief Justice Earl Warren, new to the Court but old in the ways of politics, achieved the impossible – a unanimous decision to reverse the 58-year-old false doctrine of “separate but equal” education for blacks. Impeccably researched and elegantly written, this may be the most revealing report ever published of America’s highest court at work.Based on extensive interviews and both published and unpublished documentary sources, Simple Justice has the lineaments of an epic. It will stand as the classic study of a turning point in our history.",1400030617,9781400030613),Paperback,,880 pages,"

He's also struggling to bury his past as a cripple and shed his financial ties to his benevolent ""Uncle"" Ebenezer by losing himself in the thick of London's underbelly. He boards at a brothel in exchange for teaching the mistress how to read and spends his nights dredging the Thames for dead bodies and the treasures in their pockets.Timothy's life takes a sharp turn when he discovers the bodies of two dead girls, each seared with the same cruel brand on the upper arm. The sight of their horror-struck faces compels Timothy to become the protector of another young girl, Philomela, from the fate the others suffered at the hands of a dangerous and powerful man.A different kind of Christmas story, this breathless flight through the teeming markets, shadowy passageways, and rolling brown fog of 1860s London would do Dickens proud for its surprising twists and turns, and its extraordinary heart.",0060534222,9780060534226),Paperback,,416 pages,"

He is straightforward, blunt, often irreverent, and outspoken, but takes pains not to glorify any of these murderers. Some of the unique cases Douglas discusses include:  The Clairemont killer -- Six women were found stabbed to death in San Diego, three in the same apartment complex. In each case, the killer entered through an unlocked door or window in the late morning to early afternoon. A suspect was in custody, tied to one of the murders through a DNA match. Douglas was called upon to use his profiling techniques to link the other five murders to the suspect. Douglas looked at the ""signature"" of the killer, and found that all the murders were committed by the same man. The prosecution used the profile to force the jury to find the defendant guilty ofall six murders, if they felt he was guilty of the one murder. Celophus Prince was found guilty on all counts.  The schoolgirl murders -- What became Canada's ""trial of the century."" Several schoolgirls disappeared in 1992; their bodies were dumped several weeks later, beaten and sexually attacked. Canadian police agencies contacted the FBI for help on the case and to get a profile on the killer and, according to witnesses, his accomplice. Following the advice of the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico, Canada aired a television special entitled ""The Abduction of Kristin French, "" allowing agent Gregg McCrary to describe the killer's profile on air. Knowing that the murderer and his accomplice would be watching, he planned to confront the unknown killer, assuring him he would be caught. Paul Bernardo was arrested on February 17, 1993, turned in by his wife and partner in crime, Karla Leanne Homolka.. The profile was dead on the money.  Richmond's First Serial Murderer -- In 1987, Richmodd, Virginia, was struck by a serial rapist/murderer. The Richmond police called upon the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico to make up a profile of the perpetrator. The crimes and profile beared a remarkable resemblance to a string of burglaries, rapes and murders in Alexandria, Virginia, several years before. Agent Steve Mardigian then formulated a complex strategy that caught the killer who fit the profile to a tee. In the process he helped free a wrongly convicted man, who due to his low intelligence level, had become confused and confessed to the crime.  The brutal and sadistic murder of Suzanne Marie Collins, a beautiful young Marine on the verge of a brilliant career. Theculprit was caught and confessed to her killing, but his story was very different than what really happened. By delving into Sedley Alley's mind, Douglas helped bring the murderer to justice, recreating the evening from the perspective of a sadistic and angry man. Suzanne Collins' horrifying end haunts Douglas to this day. Douglas delves into other cases, including Polly Klaas' abduction and murder by Richard Allen Davis, the tragedy that lead to the creation of Megan's Law; the abduction and murder of six-year-old Cassandra Lynn Hansen, who was snatched from an evening church service; and the vicious murder and sexual assault of Nancy Newman and her two daughters, eight-year-old Melissa and three-year-old Angie in Anchorage, Alaska. He also explores the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, focusing on the double homicide purely from a behavioral perspective. Douglas examines what the facts at and surrounding the crime scene told about the killer from a behavioral point of view. From Douglas's profile, the only viable suspect to date is O.J. Simpson.With ""Journey into Darkness, "" Douglas provides more than a glimpse into the minds of serial killers; he demonstrates what a powerful weapon behavioral science has become. Profiling criminals helps not only to capture them, but also helps society understand how these predators work and what can be done to prevent them from striking again.

","Lindsay Scott hit the big time at age five, when she became the star of the television show ""Just Me and the Kids."" It seemed like she was set for life--until she had a nervous breakdown when she was eleven, because Lindsay had suddenly developed a very dangerous sense of ESP--the ability to hear what anyone was thinking about here, at any time, anywhere in the world. Lindsay's father whisked her away to her long-gone mother's house in small town Springdale, and Lindsay was amazed to discover that within the four walls of the house, she can't hear anything out of the ordinary. And so Lindsay has stayed hidden in the house, safe from other people's thoughts, doing her best to stay out of sight and let the world forget her. When the tabloids print a ""where are they now"" story about her, claiming that Lindsay's maniacal father has kept her imprisoned in her house for the past five years, a couple of well-meaning teens attempt to ""rescue"" Lindsay. For the first time in five years, Lindsay is outside the protective quiet of her house. And that's when she hears the one voice she never expected to hear: her mother's. When she discovers that perhaps her mother didn't leave voluntarily, she has a choice to make: will she risk everything to find the truth about her past--and the source of her ability?",1416939180,9781416939184),Paperback,,272 pages,"

A riveting historical narrative of the shocking events surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and the follow-up to mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln.
More than a million readers have thrilled to Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln, the page-turning work of nonfiction about the shocking assassination that changed the course of American history. Now the anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts in gripping detail the brutal murder of John Fitzgerald Kennedy—and how a sequence of gunshots on a Dallas afternoon not only killed a beloved president but also sent the nation into the cataclysmic division of the Vietnam War and its culture-changing aftermath.In January 1961, as the Cold War escalates, John F. Kennedy struggles to contain the growth of Communism while he learns the hardships, solitude, and temptations of what it means to be president of the United States. Along the way he acquires a number of formidable enemies, among them Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and Allen Dulles, director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, powerful elements of organized crime have begun to talk about targeting the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy.In the midst of a 1963 campaign trip to Texas, Kennedy is gunned down by an erratic young drifter named Lee Harvey Oswald. The former Marine Corps sharpshooter escapes the scene, only to be caught and shot dead while in police custody.The events leading up to the most notorious crime of the twentieth century are almost as shocking as the assassination itself. Killing Kennedy chronicles both the heroism and deceit of Camelot, bringing history to life in ways that will profoundly move the reader. This may well be the most talked about book of the year.",0805096663,9780805096668),Hardcover,,325 pages,"

","Carefully researched, The Ecology of the Automobile is a classic that examines the central role that auto production and consumption have played in the 20th Century.More than seventeen million people have been killed on roads since the automobile first appeared. (1993) An incalculable number have been seriously hurt. In the future, half the world is likely to be run over in a terminal squabble for oil. For today we are possessed by a mindless monster which threatens the planet itself.Considering the widespread impact of the auto on many contemporary societies, it is surprising how little attention its social and political dimensions receive - even from ecologically oriented thinkers. This, despite the fact that vehicular traffic is viewed as a major problem.In this original book, authors Freund and Martin examine the central role that auto production and consumption have played in the twentieth century: as a technological system with major impacts on public policy, land use, cultural patterns, social relations, community, natural resources, environmental quality and options for spatial mobility. The overuse and misuse that has caused auto saturation and the costs of auto-centred transport are identified. Individualist and consumerist ideologies that tend to obscure the problems of auto hegemony, including environmental and public health effects, are vigorously questioned.""For policymakers and others interested in a critical appraisal of auto dependence.""--Earthwatch""An excellent read for those interested in the environmental impacts and social role of the automobile.

","A young girl is perched on the cold chrome of yet another doctor’s examining table, missing yet another day of school. Just twelve, she’s tall, skinny, and weak. It’s four o’clock, and she hasn’t been allowed to eat anything all day. Her mother, on the other hand, seems curiously excited. She's about to suggest open-heart surgery on her child to ""get to the bottom of this."" She checks her teeth for lipstick and, as the doctor enters, shoots the girl a warning glance. This child will not ruin her plans.SickenedFrom early childhood, Julie Gregory was continually X-rayed, medicated, and operated on—in the vain pursuit of an illness that was created in her mother’s mind. Munchausen by proxy (MBP) is the world’s most hidden and dangerous form of child abuse, in which the caretaker—almost always the mother—invents or induces symptoms in her child because she craves the attention of medical professionals. Many MBP children die, but Julie Gregory not only survived, she escaped the powerful orbit of her mother's madness and rebuilt her identity as a vibrant, healthy young woman.Sickened is a remarkable memoir that speaks in an original and distinctive Midwestern voice, rising to indelible scenes in prose of scathing beauty and fierce humor. Punctuated with Julie's actual medical records, it re-creates the bizarre cocoon of her family's isolated double-wide trailer, their wild shopping sprees and gun-waving confrontations, the astonishing naïveté of medical professionals and social workers. It also exposes the twisted bonds of terror and love that roped Julie's family together—including the love that made a child willing to sacrifice herself to win her mother's happiness. The realization that the sickness lay in her mother, not in herself, would not come to Julie until adulthood. But when it did, it would strike like lightning. Through her painful metamorphosis, she discovered the courage to save her own life—and, ultimately, the life of the girl her mother had found to replace her. Sickened takes us to new places in the human heart and spirit. It is an unforgettable story, unforgettably told.",0553803077,9780553803075),Hardcover,,244 pages,"

","Now available as an audio CD, in Eudora Welty's own voice, or as a book.Eudora Welty was born in 1909 in Jackson, Mississippi. In a ""continuous thread of revelation"" she sketches her autobiography and tells us how her family and her surroundings contributed to the shaping not only of her personality but of her writing. Homely and commonplace sights, sounds, and objects resonate with the emotions of recollection: the striking clocks, the Victrola, her orphaned father's coverless little book saved since boyhood, the tall mountains of the West Virginia back country that become a metaphor for her mother's sturdy independence, Eudora's earliest box camera that suspended a moment forever and taught her that every feeling awaits a gesture. She has recreated this vanished world with the same subtlety and insight that mark her fiction.Even if Eudora Welty were not a major writer, her description of growing up in the South--of the interplay between black and white, between town and countryside, between dedicated schoolteachers and the public they taught--would he notable. That she is a splendid writer of fiction gives her own experience a family likeness to others in the generation of young Southerners that produced a literary renaissance. Until publication of this book, she had discouraged biographical investigations. It undoubtedly was not easy for this shy and reticent lady to undertake her own literary biography, to relive her own memories (painful as well as pleasant), to go through letters and photographs of her parents and grandparents. But we are in her debt, for the distillation of experience she offers us is a rare pleasure for her admirers, a treat to everyone who loves good writing and anyone who is interested in the seeds of creativity.",0674639278,9780674639270),Paperback,,104 pages,"

","From the Author - I originally envisioned Edenwitch to be a short novel, but it quickly grew into something much larger. It is now a 6-part series, each part roughly the length of a long novella (approximately 50,000 words, or 120 pages paperback).In The Witches of Jericho, the first installment in the dark fantasy Edenwitch series, the realm of Eden is in the midst of drastic change. Eve and the other witches have been driven from their homes by an ancient breed of demons returned from a mythological past. No one seems to know how or why they have been called forth, but most believe the devil is to blame. Eve scales the mountains beyond Jericho in search of answers, and discovers a device that has the capability to change the world forever. She will be forced to make a decision that will have dire consequences for years to come.Ten years later her daughter Sophia Falcomye searches for her own answers, a search which will lead her directly into the den of the demons and a date with the Voodoo Witch. Her father Saul – once a Guardian and a protector - must face his own demons, as well as the Wolf who hunts his daughter and the other witches without mercy.Meanwhile, the new railroad nears completion. It will bring the north and the south together and drive money directly into the pockets of the powerful Mayor of Jericho. At the same time, an eccentric explorer searches for the passage that could lead through the once impenetrable edge of the world…Edenwitch is a character-driven, fast-paced and absorbing read that seamlessly weaves together several plot lines into a wonderfully dark adventure…and will eventually seek answers to the oldest of questions.",,,ebook,1st Electronic,135 pages,"

","Owen Gray is a sniper. Not just a sniper. He was America's best, with a record-breaking kill in Vietnam - a man who could be hidden, motionless, for days at a time, waiting for the microsecond in which he would take out an enemy with one clean shot at 1,300 yards. He did this 96 times. In recognition, the Marine Corps renamed its sniper range in his honor. Now Gray just wants to quietly live out his life as an assistant U.S. district attorney in New York, where he is raising three adopted children, all victims of the war he is trying resolutely to forget - and atone for. He never wants to see a rifle again. But suddenly, twenty-five years after Gray placed his Winchester rifle in the Marine Corps museum, a sniper is hunting him through the streets of New York City. The sniper's bullets find their mark. But the mark is not Gray. The sniper is challenging him, warning him that he will keep on killing until Gray picks up his rifle one more time.... Gray, falling in love with a woman who is beginning to break through his shell, is determined to protect her and his children. Reluctantly caught up once again in a game that both repels and excites him, Gray leads his rival into the woods of his native Idaho, where the two best-trained killers in the world will shoot it out to the death.",0671528173,9780671528171),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Jezebel's sexual lasciviousness, Mammy's devotion, and Sapphire's outspoken anger—these are among the most persistent stereotypes that black women encounter in contemporary American life. Hurtful and dishonest, such representations force African American women to navigate a virtual crooked room that shames them and shapes their experiences as citizens. Many respond by assuming a mantle of strength that may convince others, and even themselves, that they do not need help. But as a result, the unique political issues of black women are often ignored and marginalized.In this groundbreaking book, Melissa V. Harris-Perry uses multiple methods of inquiry, including literary analysis, political theory, focus groups, surveys, and experimental research, to understand more deeply black women's political and emotional responses to pervasive negative race and gender images. Not a traditional political science work concerned with office-seeking, voting, or ideology, Sister Citizen instead explores how African American women understand themselves as citizens and what they expect from political organizing. Harris-Perry shows that the shared struggle to preserve an authentic self and secure recognition as a citizen links together black women in America, from the anonymous survivors of Hurricane Katrina to the current First Lady of the United States.",0300165412,9780300165418),Hardcover,,378 pages,"

","Emi Lost & Found series - Winner of the Best Happily Ever After of 2013 - HEA Bookshelf  “Intense doesn't begin to cover it. I cried. I sobbed. I bawled. A lot. Constantly. Take my word when I say that you and Emi will become one. I felt every emotion as if I was in the story. I could have been Emi.” - Kelli, Alphas, Authors and Books Oh My  Emi Hennigan could never have predicted her life would be like this. After wasting more than ten years being “just a friend” to her true love, Nate Wilson, Emi feels more than a little regret. Her future was set, though. Nate loved her as much as she loved him, and they were moving forward with a romance that took them both by surprise. They already knew their bad habits, quirks and the subtle nuances of expressions, but the love was all-encompassing and new to them both.  No man could compete, Emi thought, until one night – one evening, one party, one journey, one second alters her course completely.  That night, her brother’s confident best friend, Jack Holland, comes back into her life with a mission: to spend more time with Emi to prove he is the right man for her. A romance with him is the furthest thing from Emi’s mind, though, staying loyal and steadfast to a trusted man that she will always love.  In a year’s time, though, Emi must learn to make changes she’d never before considered after being impacted by unexpected events. While her fragile spirit takes time to heal, Jack slowly finds a comfortable place in her life. Only time will tell if it’s right for Emi – and enough for him.

","The Paper Garden is unlike anything else you have ever read. At once a biography of an extraordinary 18th century gentlewoman and a meditation on late-life creativity, it is a beautifully written tour de force from an acclaimed poet. Mary Granville Pendarves Delany (1700-1788) was the witty, beautiful and talented daughter of a minor branch of a powerful family. Married off at 16 to a 61-year-old drunken squire to improve the family fortunes, she was widowed by 25, and henceforth had a small stipend and a horror of a marriage. She spurned many suitors over the next twenty years, including the powerful Lord Baltimore and the charismatic radical John Wesley. She cultivated a wide circle of friends, including Handel and Jonathan Swift. And she painted, she stitched, she observed, as she swirled in the outskirts of the Georgian court. In mid-life she found love, and married. Upon her husband's death 23 years later, she arose from her grief, picked up a pair of scissors and, at the age of 72, created a new art form, mixed-media collage. Over the next decade, Mrs Delany created an astonishing 985 botanically correct, breathtaking cut-paper flowers, now housed in the British Museum and referred to as the Botanica Delanica.Delicately, Peacock has woven parallels in her own life around the story of Mrs Delany's and, in doing so, has made this biography into a profound and beautiful examination of the nature of creativity and art.Gorgeously designed and featuring 35 full-colour illustrations, this is a sumptuous and lively book full of fashion and friendships, gossip and politics, letters and love. It's to be devoured as voraciously as one of the court dinners it describes.",0771070330,9780771070334),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

It might all seem mysterious,even miraculous, if it were not so clearly explained with disarming simplicity.",,,Kindle Edition,Third,318 pages,"

","There comes a time when setting your differences aside isn’t just necessary, it’s a means of survival. After losing over half of their dens to a group rogue shifters, the wolves and leopards merged as one Pack, but living together is much more of a challenge then they expected.Danica Welsh was born to be the leopard pack healer. An accident involving a drug induced youth left her badly burned and scared—emotionally and physically. Without the ability to heal by touch, she secludes herself to the edge of town, away from Ashwood Falls’ overly concerned citizens. All hope of mating and family become a distant dream. When she finally starts to accepts the long, lonely existence ahead of her, a stranger crashes into her life, and her heart. After Nevan Mathews’ fiancé died three ago, he submerged himself into his work, cutting off all reminders of a life he dreamed of with the woman he loved. He lets his step-mother talk him into taking the first vacation in five years to visit for the holidays. But an accident delays his travel plans, sending him to Danica’s doorstep and raises a need he thought he would never feel again. Can they tear down the walls around their hearts and submit to the passion before another claims Dani for his own? Warning: Contains a shifter who's scars run deeper than skin, a human who has the heart of a shifter, and a snow storm that's sure to have them both reaching for warmth.",1623220165,9781623220167),ebook,,,"

In this time of uncertainty, only the blind boy oracle,Tersias, can see what the future holds. But awareness of his power is growing, and he is captured by Solomon, a false prophet whose purple-robed minions swarm London, looking for disciples. Tersias is just what Solomon needs, and with Tersias under his control, Solomon believes he’s finally in a position to complete his master plan. Tersias is not without friends—an unlikely alliance of teenage highwaymen and a charlatan magician swear to break down Solomon’s Citadel and rescue Tersias from his clutches. They wonder if Tersias’s power can save them all—but they haven’t realized the source of his second sight, and they aren’t aware of a much darker force that torments his soul . . .",0399242589,9780399242588),Paperback,,262 pages,"

","A serial killer is on the loose! But you may die laughing before the next victim is found. With the publication of Killing Me Softly With Your Love, a humorous mystery, award-winning author, Dan Anderson, takes us on an unforgettable romp through the noir underbelly of Southern California in the pursuit of a serial killer who murders his female victims in a most unusual manner.Chauncey McFadden, a portly, wisecracking private detective with limited homicide experience is hardly prepared for the danger and intrigue into which he is drawn when he is lured from his world of mundane investigations to find the perpetrator of a series of grisly murders. Realizing that he may be in over his head, Chauncey watches the body count climb as he pursues one lead after another with discouraging results. The pursuit of the killer leads through a cast of zany characters that includes a quirky police lieutenant who puts Chauncey down at every opportunity, a crime syndicate boss who forces Chauncey to work for him, a secret government intelligence agency that operates outside of normal boundaries, and an international consortium of Palestinian and yakuza terrorists. Will the beleaguered Chauncey survive an attack on his own life and bring the killer to justice, or will he become another fatality at the hands of the ruthless serial killer? In The McFadden Chronicles, Dan Anderson combines his two favorite subjects, mysteries and humor, to bring a new voice to the genre and show how much fun reading can be in the hands of an irreverent craftsman.",098375523X,9780983755234),ebook,,244 pages,"

The prime suspect, their son Nick, has a talent for disappearing, and the Chalmerses are a family with money and memories to burn. As Archer zeros in on Nick, he discovers a troubled blonde, a stash of wartime letters, a mysterious hobo. Then a stiff turns up in a car on an empty beach. And Nick turns up with a Colt .45. In The Goodbye Look, Ross Macdonald delves into the world of the rich and the troubled and reveals that the past has a deadly way of catching up to the present.If any writer can be said to have inherited the mantle of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, it is Ross Macdonald. Between the late 1940s and his death in 1983, he gave the American crime novel a psychological depth and moral complexity that his pre-decessors had only hinted at. And in the character of Lew Archer, Macdonald redefined the private eye as a roving conscience who walks the treacherous frontier between criminal guilt and human sin.",0375708650,9780375708657),Paperback,,256 pages,"

Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom.  But things have changed so there's nothing holding Jack in check any longer.  Other changes are occurring as well.  Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken's time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place.
 
Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady.  Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality.  But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom's go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy.  
 
Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby.  The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined.
 
Now the stage is set for Jack's massive assault on Rasalom.  Jack knows he's got just one shot.  But it's not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn's child and minimize collateral damage.  So, he comes up with a foolproof plan.

","There's A Big Life Ahead Of Her. But Can She Find The Courage To Live It?Emma is twenty-six, pretty, intelligent, and happily living with her childhood sweetheart John in a cute little Dublin apartment. Her biggest problem is that her mother won't stop nagging her to get married already. Emma and John feel like the perfect couple, their future alive with possibilities. But out of the blue, a tragedy throws her life into disarray, and Emma is suddenly, incomprehensibly, alone. As she emerges from grief, Emma has to find a whole new way of living, and her loyal friends rally round in an attempt to help. Clodagh, Emma's lifelong friend, with whom she's shared everything from mud pies to dating disasters. Anne and Richard, more-or-less happily married and debating a move to the country. Emma's brother Noel, the young Catholic priest, finding his own faith tested even as he tries to comfort Emma. Sean, the gorgeous bad boy of a thousand one-night stands, uncomfortably aware of his and Emma's growing connection. Witty, acerbic, and sometimes downright shocking, Emma documents the stories of her friends and her own recovery from grief with a candor that engages the reader from the very first page. With an amazing insight into the power of friendship and a wry, irreverent humor that considers no subject off-limits, talented new Irish writer Anna McPartlin tells a heartwarming story of the courage it takes to move past loss and learn to live.",1842232533,9781842232538),Paperback,,367 pages,"

It's a modern state driven by contemporary technology & possessed of vast oil deposits, yet its powerful religious establishment would have its customs & practices rolled back 1000 years to match those of the prophet Muhammad. With Inside the Kingdom, journalist & bestselling author Robert Lacey has given us one of the most penetrating & insightful looks at Saudi Arabia ever produced. While living for years among the nation's princes & paupers, its clerics & progressives, Lacey endeavored to find out how the consequences of the 1970s oil boom produced a society at war with itself. Filled with stories that trace a path thru the Persian Gulf War & the events of 9/11 to the oilmarket convulsions of today, Inside the Kingdom gives a modern history of the Saudis in their own words, revealing a people attempting to reconcile life under religious law with the demands of a rapidly changing world. Their struggle will have powerful reverberations around the globe.

","The Love Story of JFK Jr. and Christina HaagAn elegy to first love, a lost New York, and a young man who led his life with surprising and abundant grace   When Christina Haag was growing up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, John F. Kennedy, Jr., was just one of the boys in her circle of prep school friends, a skinny kid who lived with his mother and sister on Fifth Avenue and who happened to have a Secret Service detail following him at a discreet distance at all times. A decade later, after they had both graduated from Brown University and were living in New York City, Christina and John were cast in an off-Broadway play together. It was then that John confessed his long-standing crush on her, and they embarked on a five-year love affair. Glamorous and often in the public eye, but also passionate and deeply intimate, their relationship was transformative for both of them. With exquisite prose, Haag paints a portrait of a young man with an enormous capacity for love, and an adventurous spirit that drove him to live life to its fullest.

A haunting book, Come to the Edge is a lasting evocation of a time and a place—of the indelible sting of the loss of young love, and of the people who shape you and remain with you, whether in person or in spirit. It is about being young and full of hope, with all the potential of your life as yet unfulfilled, and of coming of age at a moment in New York’s history when the city at once held danger, magic, and endless possibilities for self-discovery.  Rarely has a love story been told so beautifully.",0385523173,9780385523172),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Self-knowledge is the starting point of all true change in the individual and the world. The darkness of the subconscious and the ego can be uncovered to reveal the light of consciousness - the eternal spiritual part of us which contains all love, peace, inner faculties, and happiness, and which can be permanently awakened and increased.In Self-Knowledge for Spiritual Awakening by Belsebuub, discover the timeless and universal form of transcendental psychology found at the root of the world's great spiritual teachings and put it into practice immediately with key spiritual exercises such as awareness, self-observation, analysis of an ego, mantras, dream recall, and meditation.In over twenty-two chapters, Belsebuub outlines the multi-dimensional structure of the psyche beyond what modern science has been able to understand, and provides a hands-on guide to using eternal sacred practices to break free of depression, addiction, anger, fear, etc. and discover one's true self and purpose.The book is based on the hugely popular Searching Within online course by Belsebuub taken by tens of thousands of people worldwide.“Everyone has the ability to change far more radically than is usually assumed. Just because the information on how to do this is currently obscure or difficult to find in society doesn't mean that it cannot be done and that a huge and radical transformation cannot be achieved. What is needed are the correct techniques to use; if they are applied properly, you will be astonished at what you can do…” ~ Belsebuub",,,ebook,,,"

Falling in love is the last thing on his busy agenda…but compromising positions can lead just about anywhere.
 David Strong knows how to do a lot of things—run an international fitness company, finesse stock portfolios and stay out of emotional entanglements. That is, until he gets tangled up with Sophie Delfino and her Sensational Sex workout. He’s supposed to help her demonstrate Kama Sutra positions for her couples’ yoga class. The rigorous postures require more than just physical control. And his co-instructor unexpectedly tests his control to the limit. Sophie’s been fantasizing about David since her teens, but she never dreamed she’d actually be expected to run through her intimate desires—with an audience! The class is very professional, tame even—or it would be, if she’d been in any of the positions before. But she hasn’t—except in her wildest fantasies about David. Sophie knows she wants David in every way, and she’s flexible enough to use whatever she has to get him. David can’t afford any unexpected distractions. Besides the sensual positions he has to endure without embarrassing himself in public, there’s an embezzler stealing from his company. And then there’s Sophie—who is well on her way to stealing his well-guarded heart.",,,Kindle Edition,,248 pages,"

","Chantal Breelan is a ward of the state, living under the care of a woman who is cold and heartless. Her past is a mystery, and her future is even more uncertain. She can’t recall why she had been taken from her parents and so she’s left with nothing but an empty hole where her childhood should have been. When she awakens from her nightmares, she’s left with terrible, violent images, as well as a boy whose face is oddly familiar, yet can’t be placed. Scared and alone, Chantal begins to confide in an imaginary friend – a shadow in the shape of a man who stands in the corner of her room. She is comforted when she believes he listens to her. On her eighteenth birthday, Chantal is forced to leave her foster home. She moves to New York City, but the start of her new life doesn’t begin as smoothly as she’d hoped. In this environment, she faces a whole new set of challenges. One night at a subway station, Chantal meets a young boy who runs away from her, and she’s compelled to follow him down into the tunnels. But this Rabbit Hole reveals a world where reality is a nightmare. Her dreams are clues to her future, and her life becomes twisted and dangerous when she learns that things that go bump in the night are not just in fairy tales and childhood stories.",1612130402,9781612130408),Paperback,1st Edition,170 pages,"

","A bold historical novel from ""one of the most original new voices of Latin American literature"" (Mario Vargas Llosa, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature).   In the early twentieth century, a struggling Joseph Conrad wrote his great novel Nostromo, about a South American republic he named Costaguana. It was inspired by the geography and history of Colombia, where Conrad spent only a few days. But in Juan Gabriel Vásquez's novel The Secret History of Costaguana, we uncover the hidden source- and one of the great literary thefts.  On the day of Joseph Conrad's death in 1924, the Colombian-born José Altamirano begins to write and cannot stop. Many years before, he confessed to Conrad his life's every delicious detail-from his country's heroic revolutions to his darkest solitary moments. Conrad stole them all. Now Conrad is dead, but the slate is by no means clear- Nostromo will live on and Altamirano must write himself back into existence. As the destinies of real empires collide with the murky realities of imagined ones, Vásquez takes us from a flourishing twentieth-century London to the lawless fury of a blooming Panama and back.  Tragic and despairing, comic and insightful, The Secret History of Costaguana is a masterpiece of historical invention. It will secure Juan Gabriel Vásquez's place among the most original and exuberantly talented novelists working today.",1594488037,9781594488030),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewNebula Awardwinning author Catherine Asaro, renowned for her epic science fiction saga of the Skolian Empire (The Quantum Rose, Spherical Harmonic, et al.), has penned her first full-length fantasy novel with The Charmed Sphere -- a story about insatiable greed, wild magic, and untamed love.Originally a novella entitled ""Moonglow"" in 2003's Charmed Destinies anthology, The Charmed Sphere is the much-expanded story about a reluctant mage and an equally reluctant heir. Chime is living an idyllic life with her family in the rural hamlet of Jacob's Vale. But her life is turned upside down when one of the King of Aronsdale's most trusted advisers, searching the kingdom for shape-mages, identifies her as a promising mage with powerful undeveloped ability. Chime reluctantly agrees to travel to Castle Suncroft, where she is to be trained in the art of magecraft -- and also groomed for her marriage to Prince Muller, the heir to the throne of Aronsdale! Muller is the nephew to the king, and the last thing he wants to do is get married and rule a kingdom. He's more concerned with fashion than affairs of state. When the King of Aronsdale dies and Muller continues to postpone his royal ascension, the leader of a neighboring kingdom -- along with an insane mage bent on destroying Aronsdale -- sees the transition as the perfect time to strike.Simply put, The Charmed Sphere is a novel of superlatives. If a reader were to choose only one new romantic fantasy to read, it should be Catherine Asaro's unforgettable gem. Paul Goat Allen",037381111X,9780373811113),Paperback,,473 pages,"

","An irresistible look into more than 300 years of fashion through an exquisite collection of designer dresses What woman can resist imagining herself in a beautiful designer dress? Here, for the first time ever, are 100 fabulous gowns from the permanent collection of the renowned Costume Institute at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, each of which is a reminder of the ways fashion reflects the broader culture that created it.Featuring designs by Paul Poiret, Coco Chanel, Madame Grès, Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace, Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen, and many others, this one-of-a-kind collection presents a stunning variety of garments. Ranging from the buttoned-up gowns of the late 17th century to the cutting-edge designs of the early 21st, the dresses reflect the sensibilities and excesses of each era while providing a vivid picture of how styles have changed—sometimes radically—over the years. A late 1600s wool dress with a surprising splash of silver thread; a large-bustled red satin dress from the 1800s; a short, shimmery 1920s dancing dress; a glamorous 1950s cocktail dress; and a 1960s minidress—each tells a story about its period and serves as a testament to the enduring ingenuity of the fashion designer’s art.Images of the dresses are accompanied by informative text and enhanced by close-up details as well as runway photos, fashion plates, works of art, and portraits of designers. A glossary of related terms is also included.",0300166559,9780300166552),Paperback,,232 pages,"

","Astronomers have determined that our universe is 13.7 billion years old. How exactly did they come to this precise conclusion? How Old Is the Universe? tells the incredible story of how astronomers solved one of the most compelling mysteries in science and, along the way, introduces readers to fundamental concepts and cutting-edge advances in modern astronomy. The age of our universe poses a deceptively simple question, and its answer carries profound implications for science, religion, and philosophy. David Weintraub traces the centuries-old quest by astronomers to fathom the secrets of the nighttime sky. Describing the achievements of the visionaries whose discoveries collectively unveiled a fundamental mystery, he shows how many independent lines of inquiry and much painstakingly gathered evidence, when fitted together like pieces in a cosmic puzzle, led to the long-sought answer. Astronomers don't believe the universe is 13.7 billion years old--they know it. You will too after reading this book. By focusing on one of the most crucial questions about the universe and challenging readers to understand the answer, Weintraub familiarizes readers with the ideas and phenomena at the heart of modern astronomy, including red giants and white dwarfs, cepheid variable stars and supernovae, clusters of galaxies, gravitational lensing, dark matter, dark energy and the accelerating universe--and much more. Offering a unique historical approach to astronomy, How Old Is the Universe? sheds light on the inner workings of scientific inquiry and reveals how astronomers grapple with deep questions about the physical nature of our universe.",0691147310,9780691147314),Hardcover,,370 pages,"

","In September 1998, Michael J. Fox stunned the world by announcing he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease -- a degenerative neurological condition. In fact, he had been secretly fighting it for seven years. The worldwide response was staggering. Fortunately, he had accepted the diagnosis and by the time the public started grieving for him, he had stopped grieving for himself. Now, with the same passion, humor, and energy that Fox has invested in his dozens of performances over the last 18 years, he tells the story of his life, his career, and his campaign to find a cure for Parkinson's.Combining his trademark ironic sensibility and keen sense of the absurd, he recounts his life -- from his childhood in a small town in western Canada to his meteoric rise in film and television which made him a worldwide celebrity. Most importantly however, he writes of the last 10 years, during which -- with the unswerving support of his wife, family, and friends -- he has dealt with his illness. He talks about what Parkinson's has given him: the chance to appreciate a wonderful life and career, and the opportunity to help search for a cure and spread public awareness of the disease. He is a very lucky man, indeed.",0091879205,9780091879204),Hardcover,,260 pages,"

","ILHAM FITRI… Sekaliku menyatakan cinta, usahlah kau meraguinya lagi. Sekaliku janji padamu, cukuplah untuk selamanya. Namun, semakin meniti masa, cintamu kian ragu di mana luhurnya. Hinggakan kudus cinta itu sirna begitu saja. Takku tahu setulus mana kasih, tidakku pasti setelus mana cinta. Sanggupku tentang satu dunia demi cintamu dan apalah kiranya andai kau sendiri yang menentang. Andai jodoh itu bukan milik kita, aku akan berlalu dari hidupmu dan biarkanlah kasih yang terlerai itu tidak bercantum lagi. Sesungguhnya, andai Dia mengizinkanku, aku ingin menyintaimu selagi ada nafas di sebalik jasadku yang sudah hampir rebah. – Nur Wafiah.“Fiah takut ada pulak yang terjatuh cinta dekat Am. Menangis lagu dangdut la Fiah nanti,” gurauku agar dia tidak rasa bersalah.- Wafiah“Ala… biarlah dia orang nak terjatuh cinta ke, terjatuh tangga ke, Am peduli apa! Bukan Am yang terjatuh pun. Am terjatuh pada Nur Wafiah aje.” – Ilham FitriNUR WAFIAH… Kau cinta pandang pertamaku. Namun, makin meniti ketika, ukhuwah yang berlandaskan cinta itu seakan-akan palsu pula. Adakah kau yang berdusta atau akukah yang terlalu curiga? Andai kasih yang singgah hanya sebagai peneman resah, maafkanlah aku kerana telah menyentuh hati dan tulus kasihmu. Sehinggakan kesan air mata itu tak dapat kering lagi walaupun kisah pedih itu kian berlalu pergi. –Ilham Fitri“Akaun dengan cinta, sama ke?” tanyaku dengan kening yang sedikit terjongket.- Wafiah“Eh, mestilah. Sebab cinta ni adalah hasil tambah Ilham dan Wafiah!” ucapnya ceria. - Ilham FitriBenarkah cinta perlukan masa untuk mendalaminya? Adakah jangka waktu mengenali itu penting dalam hubungan mereka? Bila Ilham Fitri mengatakan tidak perlu, Nur Wafiah mengakuinya. Tika kasih tercipta, Ilham Fitri membantah hakikat itu pula. Nur Wafiah pasrah demi maruah hingga kasih itu terlerai jua pada akhirnya. Hati yang retak bisa bercantum, terlerai kasih mereka mungkinkah akan bersambung?",,,Paperback,,858 pages,"

","“Idel’s book has broken new ground in the study of the mystical Judaism of Eastern Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. By applying what he calls the panoramic approach, in contrast to the existentialist approach of Buber and the historicist approach of Scholem, Idel has been able to illuminate the phenomenon of Hasidism in all its complexity and diversity. Rather than focusing on any one immediate aspect of Jewish mysticism, Idel proposes to understand Hasidism as the aggregation of multiple streams, including magic, theosophic kabbalah, and ecstatic kabbalah. By applying Idel’s orientation one can appreciate the complex fabric woven by the Hasidic masters from previous mystical sources. His book is provocative and stimulating.” ― Elliot R. Wolfson, New York University“The author succeeds in broadening our understanding of Hasidism through clarifying its relations to phenomenological models that are typical of earlier stages of Jewish mysticism. As a result of Idel’s vast knowledge of mystical and philosophical literature, he is able to demonstrate and clarify the extent that Hasidism is dependent on non-Lurianic schools of Kabbalah. Thus, Hasidism emerges as an important stage in Jewish mysticism, rather than as a mere reaction or result of historical and social forces such as Sabbatianism.""Idel focuses on one of the most significant, yet little understood developments in the history of Jewish thought and religion. His close study of ecstasy and magic will be essential for all those who are in any way interested in this area.“The book is full of brilliant insights concerning the meaning of key concepts and practices in early Hasidism."" ― Miles Krassen, Oberlin College",0791417344,9780791417348),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","""In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and last but not least I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all of these things I am not the least bit sorry. I have no conscience so that does not worry me. I don't believe in man, God nor Devil. I hate the whole damn human race including myself.""Carl Panzram, who called himself the ""world's worst murderer,"" wrote these words in a full autobiography and confession he prepared for the one friend in his life-a young prison guard named Henry Lesser. PANZRAM: A JOURNAL OF MURDER, combines these brutally forthright memoirs with the commentary of authors Gaddis and Long, into a compelling chronicle of the forces that engender hate. The authors provide a historical and sociological framework for Panzram's own words, using this uniquely detailed self-analysis by a mass murderer to depict what happens when an intelligent and unbreakable personality that has been interminably and unmercifully abused strikes back in vengeance.  PANZRAM arrives as a gripping warning from America's recent past to our newly repressive era of prison-industrial complex, death penalty abuse, and unprecedentedly high rates of incarceration from a man who walked the halls of Death Row with a blindingly clear vision.

The historic underground maze of pipes and tunnels is famous for making the City of Light sanitary, and to Monk, that is worth paying tribute to. The only problem is that their explorations lead them to another hidden world below the Parisian streets: the catacombs, filled with aging skulls and bones.

","Not since The Diary of Anne Frank has there been such a book as this; The joyful but ultimately heartbreaking journal of a young Jewish woman in occupied Paris, now being published for the first time, 63 years after her death in a Nazi concentration camp. Born April 7, 1942, Berr, a 21-year-old Jewish student of English literature at the Sorbonne, took up her pen and started to keep a journal, writing with verve and style about her everyday life in Paris. about her studies, her friends, her growing affection for the boy with the grey eyes, about the sun in the dewdrops, and about the effect of the growing restrictions imposed by France's Nazi occupiers. Berr brought a keen literary sensibility to her writing, a talent that renders the story it relates all the more rich, all the more heartbreaking. The first day Berr has to wear the yellow star on her coat, she writes, ;I held my head high and looked people so straight in the eye they turned away. But it's hard.; More, many more, humiliations were to follow, which she records, now with a view to posterity. She wants the journal to go to her fiance, who has enrolled with the Free French Forces, as she knows she may not live much longer. She was right.

In secular Europe, the veracity of modern science is almost always taken for granted. Whether they think of the evolutionary proofs of Darwin or of spectacular investigation into the boundaries of physics conducted by CERN's Large Hadron Collider, most people assume that scientific enquiry goes to the heart of fundamental truths about the universe. Yet elsewhere, science is under siege. In the USA, Christian fundamentalists contest whether evolution should be taught in schools at all. And in Muslim countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Pakistan and Malaysia, a mere 15% of those recently surveyed believed Darwin's theory to be ""true"" or ""probably true."" This thoughtful and passionately argued book contends absolutely to the contrary: not only that evolutionary theory does not contradict core Muslim beliefs, but that many scholars, from Islam's golden age to the present, adopted a worldview that accepted evolution as a given. Guessoum suggests that the Islamic world, just like the Christian, needs to take scientific questions -- quantum questions -- with the utmost seriousness if it is to recover its true heritage and integrity. In its application of a specifically Muslim perspective to important topics like cosmology, divine action and evolution, the book makes a vital contribution to debate in the disputed field of ""science and religion.""

","Perhaps now best known as an acclaimed (and bestselling) author of fiction, Joe Klein has for nearly three decades been one of contemporary journalism's premiere reporters. In ""Woody Guthrie: A Life"", Klein's signature style of insightful narrative nonfiction brings to life a vivid chapter in the history of American culture.In 1998, the Woody Guthrie Foundation made public for the first time more than 10,000 of his papers, letters, song lyrics, and artworks, sparking renewed interest in the life of an American folk legend who influenced generations of musicians to come. The New York Times, reporting on the phenomenon, described Guthrie's appeal and legacy succinctly: ""(Woody Guthrie was) one of the most influential cultural figures of the century. Guthrie inspired Bob Dylan and virtually created the modern folk tradition and singer-songwriter genre, and his music remains as vital today as when he was performing"".Born in Oklahoma in 1912, Guthrie spent his early years among the farmers and migrant workers of the dust bowl. As a young man during the Great Depression, he traveled across the country by boxcar with his guitar, composing the indelible folk ballads that made him a leader of the politically vital folk movement of the pre-war era. Tragically, the onset of Huntington's disease, gradually diminished his mind, body, and work, and led to his untimely death at the age of 55. Still, Guthrie's life and music have inspired every important folk and folk rock artist since, from Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez to Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, and Ani DiFranco.",0385333854,9780385333856),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Life can be cruel. People can be ruthless and evil. The world can be cold and uninviting. No one knows these things better than Josephine Geroux. By her own definition, she is a twenty-five year old “nobody with nothing,” and she is content to stay that way. Growing up an orphan has made her tough and indifferent to the people around her until she meets a strangely familiar man with a face that haunts her for reasons she can’t understand.Despite the pain that will inevitably ensue, she makes it her mission to discover what parts of her tragic puzzle she is missing. On her journey to discovering why the she feels an alarming connection to an absolute stranger, her greatest fear is reawakening the demons and darkness from the past that will surely overtake her if she lets her guard down. Little does Josephine know that the past should be the least of her worries. She is toying with a man who has already broken her heart once. She just doesn’t realize it.Although she makes it a point to avoid interactions with others, Josephine’s life becomes entangled with the enigmatic stranger. Before she realizes it, she has given herself over to the one person who is close enough to wreck her.Word Count: 60,230 ",,,Nook,,181 pages,"

","Every woman makes choices. And no one has made more difficult choices than Olivia Grayson. The enormously successful businesswoman missed out on much of her children’s lives while she built her legendary home-furnishings empire. In Danielle Steel’s character-rich new novel, Olivia faces the past, tries to balance the present, and makes amends where due, while still running her vastly successful business. THE SINS OF THE MOTHER As a way of making up to them for time lost, Olivia spends months every year planning a lavish holiday that everyone in her family will enjoy. This summer she has arranged a dream trip in the Mediterranean on a luxurious yacht, which she hopes will be the most memorable vacation of all. Her lavish gesture every year expresses her love for them, and regret at all the important times she missed during her children’s younger years. Her younger daughter, Cassie, a hip London music producer, refuses the invitation altogether, as she does every year. Her older daughter, Liz, lives in her mother’s shadow, with a terror of failure as she tries to recapture her dream of being a writer. And her sons, John and Phillip, work for Olivia, for better or worse, with wives who wish they didn’t. In the splendor of the Riviera, this should be a summer to remember, with Olivia’s children, grandchildren, and daughters-in-law on board. But as with any family gathering, there are always surprises, and no matter how glamorous the setting things don’t always turn out as ones hopes.  Family dynamics are complicated, old disappointments die hard, and as forgiveness and surprising revelations enter into it, new bonds are formed, and the future takes on a brighter hue. And one by one, with life’s irony, Olivia’s children find themselves committing the same “sins” for which they blamed their mother for so many years. It is a summer of compassion, important lessons, and truth. The Sins of the Mother captures the many sides of family love: complex, challenging, funny, passionate, and hopefully enduring. Along the way, we are enthralled by an unforgettable heroine, a mother strong enough to take more than her fair share of the blame, wise enough to respect her children for who they really are, and forgiving enough to love them unconditionally.",0385343205,9780385343206),Hardcover,,354 pages,"

","The book was first published in 1899. The story of Husain and Zammarrud fallen in the grip of the Assassins take us back to the last days of Hasan Bin Sabah's merciless followers, at the end of which the sect's stronghold, the famous fort of Alamoot, was destroyed by the even more merciless Mongol hordes. Sharar writes famously in the style of a Walter Scott novel, the novel itself being a new literary form in his day. But there are shades of an earlier indigenous genre - the Dastaan - in his work. Yet although he tells a gripping tale, part Scott and part Dastaan, he is not unaware of character. Husain may be credulous, and smitten silly by his love for Zammarrud, but he can still ask Shaikh Vujoodi intelligent questions which the Shaikh can only parry by the display of great wrath and superhuman knowledge. Husain's credulity in accepting his answers immediately has a lot to do with his fear that he would not be allowed to visit his beloved in 'Paradise.' There is a definite modern streak in Sharar's work. His treatment of Zamarrud is different from the usual portrayal of female characters in his day. Zamarrud has a mind of her own. She is observant and intelligent and capable of rebuffing her lover when he sounds credulous and foolish. No old fashioned perceptions of female 'duty' or the superior status of men holds her back from realizing that she is more clear-headed than Husain. She is moreover not mild of manner or adulatory of her man, as the prototypes of female perfection tend to be in Urdu literature of the day. Yet non of this detracts from her femininity, as she runs around 'like a delicate, fleet-footed doe' but fully determined to have her way. Much has been written about the Assassins in English and other languages. Sharar's novel has its own charm, and given a chance it should become a very popular book. Translated into Tajik, Sharar's works have quite a lot of readers in Tajikistan, where they are also the subject of a Ph.D. dissertation by Vladimir Lanikin.",9693501306,9693501306,Hardcover,,165 pages,"

","The story of the rise of the human rights movement by the renowned international attorney, in a newly revised and expanded edition. For centuries it seemed an impossible dream that international institutions could ever tell nation-states how to treat their own citizens. But after a century in which 160 million lives have been wasted by war, genocide, and torture, the worldwide human rights movement is gaining popular and political strength. In a book that has been called ""an epic work"" by ""The Times"" (London), Geoffrey Robertson, one of the world's leading human rights lawyers, weaves together disparate strands of history, philosophy, international law, and politics to show how an identification of the crime against humanity, first defined at Nuremberg, has become the key that unlocks the closed door of state sovereignty, enabling the international community to bring tyrants and torturers to heel. This newly revised and expanded edition features additional chapters on Iraq and Guantanamo, and incorporates insights from the author's experience since 2002 as a UN appeals judge for the Special Court on war crimes in Sierra Leone. Robertson also brings us up to date on the trials against Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein and the International Criminal Court at Darfur.",0141024631,9780141024639),Paperback,,658 pages,"

","India today is a vibrant free-market democracy, a nation well on its way to overcoming decades of widespread poverty. The nation's rise is one of the great international stories of the late twentieth century, and in India Unbound the acclaimed columnist Gurcharan Das offers a sweeping economic history of India from independence to the new millennium.Das shows how India's policies after 1947 condemned the nation to a hobbled economy until 1991, when the government instituted sweeping reforms that paved the way for extraordinary growth. Das traces these developments and tells the stories of the major players from Nehru through today. As the former CEO of Proctor & Gamble India, Das offers a unique insider's perspective and he deftly interweaves memoir with history, creating a book that is at once vigorously analytical and vividly written. Impassioned, erudite, and eminently readable, India Unbound is a must for anyone interested in the global economy and its future.",0385720742,9780385720748),Paperback,,432 pages,"

What does our universe look like? What does it have in common with human physiology? How are we connected to it? What natural infrastructures are designed into it? What did the inhabitants of Babel intend to accomplish when they started building a pyramid? What of our Heavenly progenitors? Is there an eternal pattern of creation, opposition, and redemption common to the Fathers of our God? Are human beings mere creations of God, or are we His literal offspring?

First, that Matthew Stover was one of the most gifted fantasy writers of his generation. And second, that Caine was a hero whose peers go by such names as Conan and Elric. Like them, Caine was something new: a civilized man who embraced savagery, an actor whose life was a lie, a force of destruction so potent that even gods thought twice about crossing him. Now Stover brings back his greatest creation for his most stunning performance yet.Caine is washed up and hung out to dry, a crippled husk kept isolated and restrained by the studio that exploited him. Now they have dragged him back for one last deal. But Caine has other plans. Those plans take him back to Overworld, the alternate reality where gods are real and magic is the ultimate weapon. There, in a violent odyssey through time and space, Caine will face the demons of his past, find true love, and just possibly destroy the universe.

","From the witty and excoriating voice of journalist Nick Cohen, a powerful and irreverent dissection of the agonies, idiocies and compromises of mainstream liberal thought. He comes from the Left. When he was a child, his mother would search supermarket shelves for politically reputable citrus fruit, and despair. Aged 13, when he learned his kind and thoughtful English teacher voted Conservative, he nearly fell off his chair: 'To be good, you had to be on the Left.' Today he's no less confused. When he looks around him, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq, he sees a community of Left-leaning liberals standing on their heads. Why do apologies for a militant Islam standing for everything the liberal-Left is against come from a section of it? After the US/UK wars in Bosnia and Kosovo against Milosevic's ethnic cleansers, why were some on the Left denying the existence of Serb concentration camps? Why is Palestine a cause for the liberal-Left, but not, for instance, China, the Sudan, Zimbabwe or North Korea? Why can't those who say they support the Palestinian cause tell you what type of Palestine they'd like to see? After the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington DC, why were you as likely to read that a conspiracy of Jews controlled US or UK foreign policy in a liberal literary journal as in a neo-Nazi rag? It's easy to know what the Left is fighting against--the evils of Bush and corporations--but what and who are they fighting for? As he tours the follies of the Left, he asks us to reconsider what it means to be liberal today. With the angry satire of Swift, he reclaims the values of democracy and solidarity that united the movement against fascism, asking: What's Left?.",0007229690,9780007229697),Paperback,1st Edition,405 pages,"

One night with a leather-clad man of mystery has led to a divine punishment: the Mark of Cain.Thrust into a world where sinners are drafted into service to kill demons, Eve’s learning curve is short. A longtime agnostic, she begrudgingly maneuvers through a celestial bureaucracy where she is a valuable but ill-treated pawn. She’s also become the latest point of contention in the oldest case of sibling rivalry in history... But she’ll worry about all that later.

","Niall Ferguson follows the money to tell the human story behind the evolution of finance, from its origins in ancient Mesopotamia to the latest upheavals on what he calls Planet Finance. Bread, cash, dosh, dough, loot, lucre, moolah, readies, the wherewithal: Call it what you like, it matters. To Christians, love of it is the root of all evil. To generals, it’s the sinews of war. To revolutionaries, it’s the chains of labor. But in The Ascent of Money, Niall Ferguson shows that finance is in fact the foundation of human progress. What’s more, he reveals financial history as the essential backstory behind all history. With the clarity and verve for which he is known, Ferguson elucidates key financial institutions and concepts by showing where they came from. What is money? What do banks do? What’s the difference between a stock and a bond? Why buy insurance or real estate? And what exactly does a hedge fund do? This is history for the present. Ferguson travels to post-Katrina New Orleans to ask why the free market can’t provide adequate protection against catastrophe. He delves into the origins of the subprime mortgage crisis.",1594201927,9781594201929),Hardcover,,442 pages,"

Yet more disturbing is the discovery, a day later, of the matching hand. Both have been recently amputated, and the indications are that the victim was still alive when they were removed.DI Jack Caffery has been newly seconded to the Major Crime Investigation Unit in Bristol.

","The sequel to the international best-selling novel The Art of Hearing Heartbeats
 
 Almost ten years have passed since Julia Win came back from Burma, her father’s native country. Though she is a successful Manhattan lawyer, her private life is at a crossroads; her boyfriend recently left her, she has suffered a miscarriage, and she is, despite her wealth, unhappy with her professional life. Julia is lost and exhausted.   One day, in the middle of an important business meeting, she hears a stranger’s voice in her head that causes her to leave the office without explanation. In the following days, her crisis only deepens. Not only does the female voice refuse to disappear, but it starts to ask questions Julia has been trying to avoid. Why do you live alone? To whom do you feel close? What do you want in life?   Interwoven with Julia’s story is that of a Burmese woman named Nu Nu who finds her world turned upside down when Burma goes to war and calls on her two young sons to be child soldiers.

","A prophecy of old continued to burn in the embers of time; long left dormant until the Cruentus family rose above all others as darkness ascended the lands. Greed and deception were the name of the game, and Arturo Cruentus would stop at nothing as he concocted the ultimate scheme to get everything he wanted. No price was too high. The scene was set, the pieces strategically placed. The Gallo family could not come against him, and in the end Guido and Palmiria Gallo would come out the biggest losers, watching their only daughter, Emiliana, be taken away to render a debt settled.Young Emiliana Gallo, a victim of circumstance, was thrust into a world she did not understand and forced to marry a man she did not know. But what no one expected, not even Arturo, was that Emiliana and his son, Donato, would fall in love against all odds. For Arturo, love made one weak, but for his son, it was love at first sight. Donato became an opportunist in his father’s dirty schemes and did everything in his power to ensure the woman he admired for so long not only took his name in marriage, but also fell in love with him. Donato wanted it all, his gamble paid off richly, and he achieved both marriage and love. However, on the day they said ‘I do’ and the Cruentus and Gallo families were joined, Emiliana was ripped from their home like a thief in the night.An unknown force too unsettled to let the vision spill and strengthen the Cruentus family decided to do the unthinkable—double-cross the Cruentus family. Rage and disdain fuelled Donato and Arturo. Though their reasons were very different-their goal unified them. They squared off with the leader of the Russian Coven to take back Emiliana, and in the end the Russian coven paid the highest price as the leader's blood was spilled in retribution for his crime at the hands of Arturo. News spread quickly to the Magia Council, and before long Arturo was called before them to answer for his crime of murder unjustly. The Ancients of the roundtable at Mount Blanc, the mountain range bordering Italy and France, was now enacted as they listened to the tale that had unfolded. Little did they know that they were a part of the grand scheme Arturo Cruentus shrewdly planned for the ultimate betrayal.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Love is something everyone longs for at the deepest level—but for some, love is a curse. This is most certainly true for Asher Lake, the Keeper of an unknown group of people called ani-shifts. Ani-shifts, those with the ability to shift into animal forms, compose a secretive body of individuals known simply as the Union.A wolf in shifter form, Asher lives with a curse placed upon him and his predecessors by the elusive Raven—a dark entity whose identity remains a mystery. According to the ancient archives, the Raven’s curse is conditional and set in motion by one fatal decision: if a Keeper ever allows himself to fall in love he will die. Choosing to live in isolation within the walls of Lake Manor, a private estate concealed by the dense woods of Brokenridge, Asher has vowed never to love or to fall in love with anyone believing it to be the only way to survive. However, after ten years of neglecting his people and the protégés left in his care, along with the impending threats of an uprising, Asher learns the only way to break the Raven’s curse on future Keepers, thereby preventing them from suffering the same fate, is to accept his. This becomes his strongest challenge of all when he encounters Elle Ison, the woman of his dreams. Does Elle hold the key? Can she help him change his fate?",1014820414,1014820414,Paperback,,264 pages,"

Its leader, Jim Ralston, is a blue-collar worker who is approached by disenfranchised youths seeking his leadership in establishing an activist group in their downtrodden community. Their worst fears are realized when a serial killer makes his presence known in the area, the crime scenes indicating a racial motivation. Detective Darrell Mathis initiates a campaign against the Orion Killer, focusing his investigation on the Klansmen. The novel explores the intricate relations between activist groups and their surrounding communities, and how they are forced to make decisions that change their own world views and social philosophies in resolving complex issues. The Klan finds itself increasingly empowered in changing the neighborhoods in which they live, and racial barriers begin to collapse as they recognize their responsibility towards their fellow man regardless of race or creed.",1608360709,9781608360703),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Set on the crazier fringes of 1950s literary London, A Far Cry from Kensington is a delight, hilariously portraying love, fraud, death, evil, and transformation. Mrs. Hawkins, the majestic narrator of A Far Cry from Kensington, takes us well in hand and leads us back to her threadbare years in postwar London. There, as a fat and much admired young war widow, she spent her days working for a mad, near-bankrupt publisher (""of very good books"") and her nights dispensing advice at her small South Kensington rooming house. At work and at home Mrs. Hawkins soon uncovered evil: shady literary doings and a deadly enemy; anonymous letters, blackmail, and suicide. With aplomb, however, Mrs. Hawkins confidently set about putting things to order, little imagining the mayhem that would ensue. Now decades older, thin, successful, and delighted with life in Italy--quite a far cry from Kensington--Mrs. Hawkins looks back to all those dark doings and recounts how her own life changed forever. She still, however, loves to give advice: ""It's easy to get thin. You eat and drink the same as always, only half...I offer this advice without fee; it is included in the price of this book.""",0811214575,9780811214575),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","Roger Dawson's Secrets of Power Negotiating has changed the way American business thinks about negotiating. Thinking ""win-win""--looking for that magical third solution in which everyone wins but nobody loses--can be a naive and ultimately unsuccessful approach in today's tough business environment. Power Negotiating teaches that the way you negotiate can get you everything you want and still convince the other side that they won also. This third edition has been completely revised and updated to reflect the changing dynamics of business today. New and expanded sections include:Twenty sure-fire negotiating gambits.How to negotiate over the telephone, by e-mail, and via instant messaging.How to read body language.Listening to hidden meanings in conversation.Dealing with people from other cultures.How to become an expert mediator.Secrets of Power Negotiating covers every aspect of the negotiating process with practical, proven advice, from beginning steps to critical final moves: how to recognize unethical tactics, key principles of the Power Negotiating strategy, why money is not as important as everyone thinks, negotiating pressure points, understanding the other party and gaining the upper hand, and analyses of different negotiating styles.",1601631391,9781601631398),Paperback,15th Anniversary Edition,352 pages,"

","A stunning fictionalized account of the infamous life of British colonial officer and translator Sir Richard Francis BurtonThis fictionalized account imagines the life of Sir Richard Francis Burton--a nineteenth-century British colonial officer with a rare ability to assimilate into indigenous cultures. Burton's obsessive traveling took him from England to British India, Arabia, and on a quest for the source of the Nile River in Africa. He learned more than twenty lan-guages, translated ""The Arabian Nights"" and the Kama Sutra, and took part in the pilgrimage to Mecca, in addition to writing several travel books.This elegant, layered novel tells the story of Burton's adventures in British West India, his experience on the hajj to Mecca, and his exploration of East Africa. In each section, perspective shifts between Burton and the voices of those men he encounters along the way: his Indian servant tells the stories of his travails with Burton to a scribe; the qadi, the governor, and the shari in Mecca investigate Burton's hajj; and Sidi Mubarak Bombay, his African guide, shares his story with friends in Zanzibar. The concentric narratives examine the underbelly of colonialism while offering a breathtaking tour of the nineteenth century's most stunning landscapes.""The Collector of Worlds"" won the fiction prize of Germany's Leipzig Book Fair in 2006 and the Berlin Literary Award, in addition to being a runaway bestseller in Germany",0571236537,9780571236534),Hardcover,,454 pages,"

For when a young couple finds a boy asleep on their porch, their lives take an unexpectedly joyous turn.When John and Marta found the boy on the porch, they were curious, naturally, as to why he was there-and they didn't expect him to stay, not at first, but he did stay, day after day, until it seemed as if he belonged, running and smiling and laughing his silent laugh, tapping and patting on every surface as he made his music, and painting-with water, with paint, with mud-those swirly swirls and swings and trees.One day a young couple wakes to find a boy asleep on their porch. Unable to speak, the boy cannot explain his history. What kind of person would leave their child with strangers? All they know is that they have been chosen to care for this boy. And as their connection to him grows, they embrace his exuberant spirit and talents. The three of them blossom into an unlikely family, and John and Marta and the boy begin to see the world in brand-new ways.

The same can’t be said of Abraham Karastovsky, Brooklyn’s friend and former employer.  On the eve of a celebration for his latest book restoration, Brooklyn finds her mentor lying in a pool of his own blood. With his final breath Abraham leaves Brooklyn with a cryptic message, “Remember the Devil,” and gives her a priceless—and supposedly cursed—copy of Goethe’s Faust for safe-keeping.

","Who Owns Arizona is a murder mystery set in the American West during the traumatic post-Civil War period. This fast-paced story has more twists and turns than a runaway river in flood stage. It begins in San Francisco when Drew Steele, a Civil War-veteran turned detective, is hired by newspaperman John Rudd to go to the Arizona territory to find a long-lost Spanish land grant that supposedly lays claim to the entire Arizona territory. Murders ensue, and Steele suspects the motive may be related to the missing Spanish land grant. Steele confronts hired gunslingers, marauding Indians, and of course, a number of beautiful, but dangerous, women as he searches for an illusive and exceptionally clever serial killer.

","Winter Simmons received the surprise of her life when she discovered the man she had been dating for the last two years was actually Viper, president of the Last Riders. A high school principal, Winter has no intention of ruining her reputation in the community to be with a man who betrayed her trust. Unforgiving, she turns her back on him, only to find that Viper is not the gentleman he portrayed. Determined to find his brother’s killer, Loker James kept his identity as President of The Last Riders a secret from Winter. When the truth comes out, he is determined to make her see the real man who can control not only a group of dangerous bikers, but a woman whose life is a rulebook. Unable to prevent herself from being drawn into the very club she despises, Winter is about to lose everything important to her, unless Viper can prove she’s more than a moonlight run. This work of fiction is intended for mature audiences only. All sexually active characters portrayed in this ebook are eighteen years of age or older. Please do not buy if strong sexual situations, multiple partners, and explicit language offends you.",,,ebook,,277 pages,"

","Mistrz i Małgorzata to komiks oparty na motywach powieści Michaiła Bułhakowa. Askold Akiszyn i Misza Zasławski nie zdecydowali się jednak na proste przełożenie powieści na język komiksu, wgłębili się we wszystkie rękopisy autora i wybrali z nich najważniejsze dla historii sceny. Sceny, które nie koniecznie znalazły się w znanej nam wersji powieści. Dlatego też komiks ten jest doskonałym uzupełnieniem dobrze znanej książki. Jego brudna warstwa graficzna oddaje moskiewską rzeczywistość tamtych lat, na przykład poprzez muzyczne motywy tła.Komiks został wydany przy współpracy z Międzynarodowym Festiwalem Komiksu i Gier w Łodzi w nowo otwartej serii Zagraniczny Wybór MFKiG.",,,Paperback,,122 pages,"

But adrenaline doesn't explain the voice in her head giving her battle tips and warnings.While worrying that she's going crazy (always a reputation ruiner), Rileigh gets a visit from Kim, a handsome martial arts instructor, who tells Rileigh she's harboring the spirit of a five-hundred-year-old samurai warrior.Relentlessly attacked by ninjas, Rileigh has no choice but to master the katana--a deadly Japanese sword that's also the key to her past. As the spirit grows stronger and her feelings for Kim intensify, Rileigh is torn between continuing as the girl she's always been and embracing the warrior inside her.",0738730408,9780738730400),Paperback,,375 pages,"

","This book intervenes in debates over the significance of Diana, Princess of Wales, by offering a critical account of her status as a media icon from 1981 to the present. It outlines the historical development of representations of Diana, analyzing the ways in which she has been understood via discourses of gender, sexuality, race, economic class, the royal, national identity, and the human. The book goes on to assess the issues at stake in debates over the ""meaning"" of Diana, such as the gender politics of cultural icon-making and deconstruction, and conflicting notions of cultural value.",0333736885,9780333736883),Hardcover,,260 pages,"

","Over the course of his 60 years, Christopher Hitchens has been a citizen of both the United States and the United Kingdom. He has been both a socialist opposed to the war in Vietnam and a supporter of the U.S. war against Islamic extremism in Iraq. He has been both a foreign correspondent in some of the world's most dangerous places and a legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for alcohol and literature. He is a fervent atheist, raised as a Christian, by a mother whose Jewish heritage was not revealed to him until her suicide.  In other words, Christopher Hitchens contains multitudes. He sees all sides of an argument. And he believes the personal is political. This is the story of his life, a life lived large.",0446540331,9780446540339),Hardcover,,435 pages,"

","How rude! Jodie Sweetin melted our hearts and made us laugh for eight years as cherub-faced, goody-two-shoes middle child Stephanie Tanner. Her ups and downs seemed not so different from our own, but more than a decade after the popular television show ended, the star publicly revealed her shocking recovery from methamphetamine addiction. Even then, she kept a painful secret—one that could not be solved in thirty minutes with a hug, a stern talking-to, or a bowl of ice cream around the family table. The harrowing battle she swore she had won was really just beginning. In this deeply personal, utterly raw, and ultimately inspiring memoir, Jodie comes clean about the double life she led—the crippling identity crisis, the hidden anguish of juggling a regular childhood with her Hollywood life, and the vicious cycle of abuse and recovery that led to a relapse even as she wrote this book. Finally, becoming a mother gave her the determination and the courage to get sober. With resilience, charm, and humor, she writes candidly about taking each day at a time. Hers is not a story of success or defeat, but of facing your demons, finding yourself, and telling the whole truth—unSweetined.",1439158207,9781439158203),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

There are the deep pine and spruce forests, the grouse and the deer, and the hunter's gun. There is Magdalena, the beautiful mistress of the village priest, whose suicide unleashes her ghost to haunt the parish. There are also the loving grandparents with whom Thomas lives, who provide a balance of the not-quite-Dostoevskian devils that visit the villagers. In the end, Thomas is severed from his childhood and the Issa River, and leaves prepared for adventures beyond his valley.

","In the slave city of Spire, Ellis has been discarded. His former master, a man who was supposed to teach him and take care of him, passed away, leaving Ellis alone and in danger of being taken to the Facility. Ellis is desperate to avoid that fate. He seeks a master to take him on, guiding him into adulthood as well as a profession. Ellis has had desire stolen from him—he’s been trained to blush, to submit, to give in. He doesn’t know how to cope with William, a man who wants the real Ellis.William is a Master, a man born in a neighbour city that does not deal in slavery. He has had bad experiences with slaves in the past, but all that changes when he rescues Harte, a young slave whose abusive master had all but destroyed him. Together, they are content in their mutual roles, not looking for anything more. But when Ellis catches the eye of Harte, and by extension, William, their relationship changes in ways for which they are unprepared.Harte is a born submissive, a young man who lives for his role. He’s bratty but genuine. William, his master, is his entire life. Harte never expected to have room in his heart for another, but Ellis is beautiful and different and fills a place in his life that he hadn’t known was empty.If only Ellis could learn to ask for what he desired, what he needed, then maybe William and Harte could help him. But Ellis is trapped inside himself, insecure and afraid. To stay with William, he only has to ask...but that’s the one thing Ellis cannot do...Advisory: This book contains some non-consensual sex, hardcore bondage and punishment, torture and abuse.

","A place where vampires rule, witches play, danger lurks and dreams really do come true.Eternal Island is a paranormal suspense novel, deeply rooted into myth. Vampires and magic form a unique backdrop to a love story with long reaching consequences. Human girl Ariana Lochalan finds herself transported from the relative calm of her ‘Nowhere, Arkansas’ life into a diametrically opposite existence when she discovers she is a powerful witch and meant to wed High Vampire of Eternal Island, Abe Cambridge. Despite first-sight magnetism, the two protagonists are being pushed apart, obstacles tripping them at every step, outside forces interfering and threatening their peace, and ultimately their lives. A world rich in magic and intrigue, Eternal Island is the first installment of a saga which has love at its core and delves through the mire that is human nature in a turmoil of feeling and emotion. Would courage, resilience and love be enough to bring together two soul mates? How much would you sacrifice to save the one who owns your heart?.",,,Kindle Edition,First,346 pages,"

","On the eve of World War II, in a place called Half-Village, a young man nicknamed the Pigeon falls in love with a girl fabled for her angelic looks. To court Anielica Hetmanská he offers up his ""golden hands"" to transform her family’s modest hut into a beautiful home, thereby building his way into her heart. Then war arrives to cut short their courtship, delay their marriage, and wreak havoc in all their lives, even sending the young lovers far from home to the promise of a new life in Kraków. Nearly fifty years later, their granddaughter, Beata, repeats their postwar journey, seeking a new life in the fairy-tale city of her grandmother’s stories. But when she arrives in Kraków, instead of the whispered prosperity of the New Poland, she discovers a city caught between its future and its past, and full of frustrated youths. Taken in by her toughtalking cousin Irena and Irena’s glamorous daughter Magda, Beata struggles to find her own place in 1990s Kraków and in the constellation of Irena and Magda’s fierce love. But unexpected events-- tragedies and miracles-- can change lives and open eyes. And Beata may just find a new way of seeing her family's and her country's history-- as well as a vision for her own role in the New Poland. Whimsical, wise, beautiful, magical, and sometimes even heartbreaking, A Long, Long Time Ago and Essentially True weaves together two remarkable stories, reimagining half a century of Polish history through the legacy of one unforgettable love affair.",0547055072,9780547055077),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","From some accidents of love and weather we never quite recover. At the worst of the Prairie dust bowl of the 1930s, a young man appears out of a blizzard and forever alters the lives of two sisters. There is the beautiful, fastidious Lucinda, and the tricky and tenacious Norma Joyce, at first a strange, self-possessed child, later a woman who learns something of self-forgiveness and of the redemptive nature of art. Their rivalry sets the stage for all that follows in a narrative spanning over thirty years, beginning in Saskatchewan and moving, in the decades following the war, to Ottawa and New York City. Disarming, vividly told, unforgettable, this is a story about the mistakes we make that never go away, about how the things we want to keep vanish and the things we want to lose return to haunt us.",1841199281,9781841199283),Paperback,,344 pages,"

","Menyamar Pedagang Durian hingga Sniper AmbonIsi buku Kopassus untuk Indonesia yang diluncurkan Kopassus TNI-AD tak sembarangan. Buku dengan desain gaul itu membuka rahasia dapur korps terbaik ketiga di dunia itu, termasuk operasi intelijen bawah tanah. Seperti apa?RIDLWAN HABIB, JakartaWANITA itu bukan tentara. Gaya pakaiannya juga santai. Turun dari mobil New Honda City metalik, dia disambut hormat oleh prajurit Kopassus. “Mbak Esti ini sudah kami anggap bagian dari keluarga,” kata Letkol Farid Makruf yang menyambut Esti di Markas Komando Kopassus, Cijantung, Jakarta Timur Kamis lalu (7/1).Siang itu suasana sekitar Kesatrian Kopassus agak lengang. Sebab, pada jam dinas, semua prajurit sibuk dengan tugas masing-masing. “Sebelum mengenal mereka, saya benar-benar awam dengan dunia militer,” kata Esti yang sengaja berkunjung ke Kopassus untuk menemui Jawa Pos.Nama lengkapnya Erastiani Asikin Natanegara. Bersama penulis lain, Iwan Santosa, mereka diberi kepercayaan penuh oleh Komandan Jenderal (Danjen) Kopassus untuk menulis buku yang mulai beredar tiga minggu lalu itu.“Buku ini adalah buku resmi Kopassus pertama yang ditulis sipil dan untuk umum,” kata Letkol Farid yang ikut berbincang. Farid adalah alumnus Akmil 1991 yang juga menjadi salah satu narasumber buku. Mantan kepala staf pribadi (Kaspri) Danjen Kopassus itu juga menjadi anggota tim penyusun buku bersama 16 orang lainnya.Menurut Farid, Kopassus sengaja meminta orang luar agar tulisannya objektif. “Mbak Esti ini mulai nul puthul. Kita memang buka apa adanya. Kalau mau ditulis jelek, ya tulis saja,” kata perwira asal Pulau Madura itu.Isi buku setebal 345 halaman itu memang blak-blakan. Misalnya, cerita seorang anggota Sandhi Yudha Kopassus yang bertugas sebagai intelijen Kopassus saat masa darurat militer di Aceh pada 2003. Sersan Badri (nama samaran, Red) bertugas untuk masuk ke lingkaran utama Gerakan Aceh Merdeka.Untuk menyukseskan misinya, Badri harus menyamar sebagai pedagang durian dari Medan. Berselang setahun, sendirian, Badri menembus akses untuk mendapat kepercayaan anggota GAM. “Saat paling sulit, saat dia diminta pimpinan GAM melindungi istrinya dari kejaran pasukan TNI. Selama tiga bulan, Badri harus mencari tempat kos yang aman dari kejaran TNI yang sebenarnya temannya sendiri,” katanya.Agar jaringan intelijen sempurna dan tidak bocor, Badri tidak pernah diketahui identitasnya sebagai anggota Kopassus kecuali oleh beberapa pimpinan operasi. Meski menyamar sebagai pedagang durian, Badri menggunakan kesempatan itu untuk menyabot senjata-senjata GAM. “Misalnya, alat pembidik pada senapan-senapan GAM sengaja digeser agar tembakan mereka melenceng atau tidak tepat sasaran,” katanya.Kisah lain yang juga sengaja dibuka Kopassus adalah tim Kopassus yang bertugas mengamankan kerusuhan Ambon pada Januari 2001. Mereka bertugas di tengah-tengah kelompok Merah (Nasrani) dan kelompok Putih (muslim). Namun, ternyata, sumber kerusuhan adalah sniper (penembak jitu) gelap yang memprovokasi serangan.Narasumber dalam kisah itu adalah Wakil Asisten Intelijen Kopassus Letkol Nyoman Cantiasa yang saat itu masih berpangkat kapten. Kebetulan Nyoman pernah menceritakan kisahnya secara singkat kepada Jawa Pos beberapa bulan lalu saat tak sengaja bertemu di Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata.Dalam buku itu, dikisahkan bahwa Nyoman memerintahkan beberapa anggota tim untuk mencari asal sniper yang menembak di malam hari. Ternyata, para perusuh itu bersembunyi di Hotel Wijaya II Ambon. Mereka juga menyadap saluran HT pasukan Nyoman. Bahkan, kata sandi Nyoman saat itu yakni Arjuna 2 juga diketahui.Berdasar penghitungan matang, Nyoman akhirnya memerintahkan tim dengan seizin Pangdam Pattimura (saat itu dijabat Mayjen M. Yasa) menyerbu Hotel Wijaya. Terjadi baku tembak selama dua jam sebelum seluruh sniper dilumpuhkan. Mereka berhasil menyita beragam senjata, seperti AK 101, AK 102, SKS, MK1, SS1 , M16, dan US Karabine 30 mm.Selain Aceh dan Ambon, Kopassus membuka kisah di balik operasi-operasi di Papua, Timor Leste (dulu Timor Timur), dan berbagai lokasi lain di Indonesia. Tidak khawatir strategi Kopassus bocor ke tangan intelijen asing? Menurut Farid, kekhawatiran selalu ada. “Tapi, ibarat memasak nasi goreng. Bumbunya tidak semua orang tahu, tapi hasilnya enak. Jadi, secara detail teknisnya masih kami tutupi,” kata Farid yang sekarang menjabat kepala penerangan Kopassus itu.Tanpa bermaksud sombong, kata Farid, Kopassus mempunyai kemampuan intelijen dan antiteror yang bisa diandalkan. “Rata-rata pembebasan sandera hanya butuh tiga menit. Di Woyla dulu juga cukup tiga menit,” katanya.Saat ditanya tentang operasi Densus 88 di Temanggung yang butuh waktu 17 jam untuk meringkus Ibrohim, otak peledakan Ritz-Carlton, Farid menggeleng. “Kami tidak mau mengomentari keahlian orang lain. Cukuplah masyarakat yang menilai dengan buku. Kalau memang Kopassus jelek, ya, silakan dianggap jelek. Apa pun itu kami bangga bertugas demi negara. Itu kehormatan komando,” kata perwira yang pernah dikirim ke Sierra Leone, Afrika, itu.Masih banyak kisah lain yang ditulis Esti. Misalnya, proses perekrutan anggota Kopassus yang ketat. Seorang prajurit yang bisa diterima Kopassus harus bisa berlari 12 menit dengan jarak tempuh minimal 2.800 meter. Lalu pull up 12 kali, push up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, sit up 40 kali minimal dalam satu menit, renang dasar 50 meter dan tidak takut ketinggian lebih dari 15 meter.Setelah itu mereka harus ikut seleksi psikologi dan jika lolos harus menjalani pendidikan komando selama tujuh bulan. Pelatihan itu sangat berat. “Mereka punya istilah kaki tomat, yakni kaki yang melepuh karena harus long march dari Bandung ke Cilacap jalan kaki dengan jarak tempuh 500 kilometer selama 10 hari dengan beban perorangan 30 kg di pundak,” kata Esti.Kisah-kisah kegalakan pelatih juga dideskripsikan. Misalnya, galaknya Kapten Encun di Pusat Pendidikan Kopassus Batujajar. Encun yang ahli melempar pisau komando itu sudah melatih spesialisasi komando 26 tahun. “Semua pohon randu di Batujajar tidak ada yang selamat. Semua dibabat habis untuk latihan lempar pisau,” katanya.Kisah-kisah humanis anggota Kopassus saat bertugas di luar negeri juga dideskripsikan. Juga saat korps baret merah itu menjadi garda depan penanggulangan bencana alam. Wanita alumnus Sastra Tiongkok, Universitas Indonesia itu mengaku hanya butuh tiga minggu untuk menyelesaikan bukunya.“Sehari saya wawancara delapan hingga 10 prajurit, mulai pangkat terbawah sampai jenderal,” katanya. Interaksi tiga minggu itu telah mengubah pandangannya tentang Kopassus. “Mereka orang-orang aneh yang mengidap adrenalin junkie, yakni orang yang bekerja sangat prima dalam kondisi stres dan dalam tekanan tinggi,” katanya.Dia mencontohkan salah seorang bintara bernama Serka Sumardi. Orang itu istimewa karena sudah 14 kali ditugaskan di medan operasi. Sedangkan rata-rata prajurit yang lain hanya empat kali. Sumardi pernah sekali ditugaskan sebagai anggota pasukan PBB di Bosnia.“Saat saya tanya apa yang paling enak dalam penugasan, dia menjawab saat dikirim ke Bosnia karena bisa merasakan enaknya landing (mendarat). Ternyata selama 14 kali terjun operasi, dia selalu dilempar ke udara dengan parasut dan belum pernah sekalipun naik pesawat. Ini ndeso, tapi jujur,” kata Esti sambil melirik Farid.Farid tertawa lepas. “Kisah-kisah seperti itu kami harap bisa menarik minat anak muda bergabung ke Kopassus. Kalau yang tua-tua, terus terang, kami capek meyakinkan mereka,” katanya. (*/iro)Sumber: Jawa Pos, 11 Januari 2010",,,Paperback,,351 pages,"

","Since his death in 1966, Lenny Bruce has been lauded as a great satirist ""in the tradition of Swift,"" as a great parodist, a moralist, a preacher, even as a shaman exorcizing the demons of our modern society. Whatever Bruce was, he was above all an incredibly funny man with an extraordinarily original and fertile comic imagination.Transcribed from hundreds of hours of taped performances, this book brings into print Lenny Bruce's greatest insights and inventions in their original form. Here is Lenny Bruce on religion, sex, the police, censorship, pot, Dracula--the whole gamut of contemporary perplexities put into perspective by a mind that deflated pretense with uninhibited wit and made people laugh in a way they had never laughed before.",,,Hardcover,,243 pages,"

","Nothing can prepare you for Anthony Loyd's portrait of war. It is the story of the unspeakable terror and the visceral, ecstatic thrill of combat, and the lives and dreams laid to waste by the bloodiest conflict that Europe has witnessed since the Second World War. Born into a distinguished military family, Loyd was raised on the stories of his ancestors' exploits and grew up fascinated with war. Unsatisfied by a brief career in the British Army, he set out for the killing fields in Bosnia. It was there--in the midst of the roar of battle and the life-and-death struggle among the Serbs, Croatians, and Bosnian Muslims--that he would discover humanity at its worst and best. Profoundly shocking, poetic, and ultimately redemptive, this is an uncompromising look at the brutality of war and its terrifyingly seductive power.",0140298541,9780140298543),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","Kriget hade pågått i nio långa år då Karl XII i juni 1709 befann sig vid den belägrade lilla staden Poltava i Ukraina på sin marsch mot Moskva. Den ryska armén under Peter den store hade närmat sig steg för steg och stod nu endast en halvmil bort. Svenskarna hade förberett sig för drabbningen och dragit ihop sina trupper som varit vitt spridda över hela den ukrainska slätten. Kungen utsåg fältmarskalken Rehnsköld till överbefälhavare och gav order om anfall, vilket skulle ske i gryningen måndagen den 28 juni. Man hade planerat att göra uppmarschen i skydd av mörkret och ta ryssarna med överraskning, men förflyttningen gick trögare än väntat och när solen gick upp var uppställningen inte klar. Det första anfallet misslyckades.Peter Englund skildrar det ödesdigra slaget timme för timme, katastrofen som ledde till det svenska stormaktsväldets fall. Mänskligt sett var det en brutal mass-slakt som ägde rum dessa heta sommardagar då 10.000 liv gick till spillo. Dagböcker och brev från tiden ger ögonvittnesskildringar.

What she didn't expect was Emrys. After their initial crash-meeting in the tunnels of the underground, she seems to bump into him everywhere: in the library and even on the street. He knows almost as much as she does about her subject area - and he's not even in school! His actions are sometimes awkward, and very out-of-the-blue - often to the level of absurdity. So when he offers to give her a tour of the old places in Wales - not far from his home - she can't help but wonder who fate has brought her. As the legends get closer and the journey becomes more dangerous, Dyllan finds more questions and fewer answers. Will she be able to finish her thesis?

","""Not Fade Away is a rock 'n' roll road novel with rhythm to burn, traveling in time from the Beat era to the dawn of the sixties. George Gastin is a San Francisco tow-truck operator who wrecks cars as part of an insurance scam. One of the cars Gastin is hired to destroy is a snow-white 1959 Cadillac that was supposed to be a present for the Big Bopper, who dies in a plane crash with Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens. Instead, Gastin takes off in the car and heads for Texas, where the Big Bopper was buried. Armed with a thousand hits of Benzedrine, Gastin navigates a road trip that will cover many miles and states of mind between the coffeehouses of San Francisco's North Beach and the open plains of the Midwest. Along the way Gastin picks up some extraordinary hitchhikers -- the self-proclaimed ""world's greatest salesman, "" the Reverend Double-Gone Johnson, and a battered housewife with a box of old 45s. As the miles and sleepless hours roll by, Gastin's trip becomes a blur of fantasy and reality fueled by a soundtrack of classic rock 'n' roll.",0802197647,9780802197641),ebook,,304 pages,"

","This is a modern revision of the classic digital design textbook. The book teaches the basic tools for the design of digital circuits in a clear, easily accessible manner. New to This Edition: *Nine sections on Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) inserted in discrete sections, allowing the material to be covered or skipped as desired. The Verilog HDL presentation is at a suitable level for beginning students who are learning digital circuits for the first time. *Reorganized material on combinational circuits is now covered in a single chapter. *The emphasis in the sequential circuits chapters is now on design with D flip-flops instead of JK and SR flip-flops. *The material on memory and programmable logic is now consolidated in one chapter. *Chapter 8 consists mostly of new material and now covers digital design in the Register Transfer Level (P) FL), preparing the reader for more advanced design projects and further Verilog HDL studies. *A new section in Chapter 11 supplements the laboratory experiments with HDL experiments. These unable the reader to check the circuits designed in the laboratory by means of hardware components and/or by HDL simulation.* Text accompanied by Verilog simulator software-SynaptiCAD's VeriLogger Pro evaluation version, a Verilog simulation environment that combines all of the features of a traditional Verilog simulator with a powerful graphical test vector generator. Fast model testing in VeriLogger Pro allows the reader to perform bottom-up testing of every model in a design. All of the HDL examples in the book can be found on the CD-ROM. *A Companion Website includes resources for instructors and students such as transparency masters of all figures in the book, all HDL code examples from the book, a Verilog tutorial, tutorials on using the VeriLogger Pro software, and more.

","""Understanding suffering always helps the energy of compassion to be born."" ~ Thich Nhat Hanh In an instant my husband stripped away my identity as wife, stay-at-home mom, and best friend. With his suicide, our world changed forever. He'd been the center of our universe, but then he was gone. Grief is a dark journey, one often tainted with judgment and false perceptions. Add the word 'suicide' to the mix and more complications arise. This memoir, Free Fall, is intended for those who may be facing their own tragedy and feeling alone, hopeless, confused, scared, and misunderstood. Free Fall is the journey of piecing our lives back together—overcoming children's anxiety as we traversed the brutal grief and trauma process, learning to say the words 'widow' and 'single mom' without cringing, surviving the fall out with friends and family who simply couldn't understand our healing process, triumphing over the stigma of 'suicide', forgiving my husband, and finding peace after chaos. Free Fall is for widows, widowers, parents, survivors of suicide, family members or friends of one who mourns. This story is for anyone who needs encouragement that there is another side to grief. There is. We're there now. We're looking back and holding our hands out to you saying, ""hang in there, you're not alone, and you'll get here, too.""",0615879543,9780615879543),Paperback,,128 pages,"

","What happens when you eat an apple? The answer is vastly more complex than you imagine.Every apple contains thousands of antioxidants whose names, beyond a few like vitamin C, are unfamiliar to us, and each of these powerful chemicals has the potential to play an important role in supporting our health. They impact thousands upon thousands of metabolic reactions inside the human body. But calculating the specific influence of each of these chemicals isn’t nearly sufficient to explain the effect of the apple as a whole. Because almost every chemical can affect every other chemical, there is an almost infinite number of possible biological consequences.And that’s just from an apple.Nutritional science, long stuck in a reductionist mindset, is at the cusp of a revolution. The traditional ""gold standard” of nutrition research has been to study one chemical at a time in an attempt to determine its particular impact on the human body. These sorts of studies are helpful to food companies trying to prove there is a chemical in milk or pre-packaged dinners that is ""good” for us, but they provide little insight into the complexity of what actually happens in our bodies or how those chemicals contribute to our health.In The China Study, T. Colin Campbell (alongside his son, Thomas M. Campbell) revolutionized the way we think about our food with the evidence that a whole food, plant-based diet is the healthiest way to eat. Now, in Whole, he explains the science behind that evidence, the ways our current scientific paradigm ignores the fascinating complexity of the human body, and why, if we have such overwhelming evidence that everything we think we know about nutrition is wrong, our eating habits haven’t changed.Whole is an eye-opening, paradigm-changing journey through cutting-edge thinking on nutrition, a scientific tour de force with powerful implications for our health and for our world.",1937856240,9781937856243),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

After years of estrangement from her father, himself an archaeologist who recently died, Freya has come to find out what she can about his work. As she reads through his research notes, she sees he learned a great deal about the Viking and Christian history of the island. But what he found only scratches the surface of the discoveries Freya is about to make.In 800 A.D. a Pictish girl named Signy loses her entire family during a Viking raid. She is taken in by the surviving members of the Christian community on Findnar, but when she falls deeply in love with a Viking boy, she is cast out. She eventually becomes a nun and finds herself at the center of the clash between the island’s three religious cultures. The tragedy of her story is that, in the end, she must choose among her adopted faith, her native religion, and the man she loves.Centuries apart, Freya and Signy are each on the verge of life-changing events that will bring present-day and Viking-era Scotland together.

","The moving, inspiring memoir of one of the great women of our times, Shirin Ebadi, winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize and advocate for the oppressed, whose spirit has remained strong in the face of political persecution and despite the challenges she has faced raising a family while pursuing her work. Best known in this country as the lawyer working tirelessly on behalf of Canadian photojournalist, Zara Kazemi - raped, tortured and murdered in Iran - Dr. Ebadi offers us a vivid picture of the struggles of one woman against the system. The book movingly chronicles her childhood in a loving, untraditional family, her upbringing before the Revolution in 1979 that toppled the Shah, her marriage and her religious faith, as well as her life as a mother and lawyer battling an oppressive regime in the courts while bringing up her girls at home. Outspoken, controversial, Shirin Ebadi is one of the most fascinating women today. She rose quickly to become the first female judge in the country; but when the religious authorities declared women unfit to serve as judges she was demoted to clerk in the courtroom she had once presided over. She eventually fought her way back as a human rights lawyer, defending women and children in politically charged cases that most lawyers were afraid to represent. She has been arrested and been the target of assassination, but through it all has spoken out with quiet bravery on behalf of the victims of injustice and discrimination and become a powerful voice for change, almost universally embraced as a hero. Her memoir is a gripping story - a must-read for anyone interested in Zara Kazemi's case, in the life of a remarkable woman, or in understandingthe political and religious upheaval in our world.",1400064708,9781400064700),Hardcover,,232 pages,"

","There is a certain line of destiny for each one of us, which seems as if no one and nothing could ever change. Is that really so, however? Perhaps, some people would disagree. These are the people that will always believe that it may be changed because it is like a strip of sand, which remains after the tide at the seashore and is different every time. Part of those people is this couple – two young companions, who can still love and have their dreams. They are gazing at the profound essence of the world’s earthly, human time as well as the one of eternity within them, the heart one. A criss-cross of interweaving roads leads them far away but only a single one brings them back home. Quite often it turns out that it is in fact the longest, really arduous and sometimes the loneliest one. When taking a look at signs in life, we can see the recollections of anguish or short-lived happiness and bliss. Nevertheless, they will always be seeking their home or perhaps the family warmth the way they remember it, that is, their hearth. In the course of time, they will realise that it is no longer there, but has turned into an unfamiliar place of lost feelings.",,,Kindle Edition,,103 pages,"

","Carmen is a novella by Prosper Mérimée, written & 1st published in 1845. It has been adapted into a number of dramatic works, including the famous opera by Georges Bizet. According to a letter Mérimée wrote to the Countess of Montijo, Carmen was inspired by a story she told him on his visit to Spain in 1830. He said, ""It was about that ruffian from Málaga who had killed his mistress, who consecrated herself exclusively to the public...As I have been studying the Gypsies for some time, I have made my heroine a Gypsy."" An important source for the material on the Romani people (Gypsies) was George Borrow's book The Zincali (1841). Another source may have been the narrative poem The Gypsies (1824) by Alexander Pushkin, which Mérimée would later translate into French prose (Briggs 2008). The novella comprises four parts. Only the 1st three appeared in the original publication in the 10/1/1845 issue of the Revue des Deux Mondes (Robinson 1992); the 4th 1st appeared in the book publication in 1846. Mérimée tells the story as if it had really happened to him on his trip to Spain in 1830.",2011552354,9782011552358),Paperback,,64 pages,"

In the summer of 1972, an innocence was lost when twenty-six young boys in a small rural town set out to accomplish something bigger than themselves. Their journey of nearly 1,400 miles would take them through eight states, crossing over the Great Smoky Mountains. It was a tremendous achievement--one that would be hailed as the longest organized bike hike in the history of Scouting.",,,Kindle Edition,,390 pages,"

","La noche de San Juan, título de la novela más importante de Mircea Eliade, corresponde, en el original rumano, a Noaptea de Sânziene, a ""la noche de las hadas"", celebrada el 23 de junio (solsticio de verano), a la que tradicionalmente se atribuye un carácter profético, capaz de vaticinar la suerte o desdicha que el destino deparará durante el año. Bajo la magia de este misterio, en la espera de esa revelación, se desarrolla el entramado heterogéneo de paisajes físicos y humanos de esta novela, que abarca, en un período de 12 años, un ciclo perfecto, cerrado y homologable a los ciclos cósmicos. El centro mágico de la obra es Bucarest, ciudad llena de símbolos iniciáticos y foco inagotable de mitos, donde, en el bosque Baneasa, se conocen los protagonistas, Stefan e Ileana. Sobre este trasfondo se proyecta el ambiente, el estado de ánimo de la juventud intelectual rumana del período de entreguerras, la tensión colectiva que desembocó en la dictadura de la Guardia de Hierro, la guerra mundial, la entrada de los rusos y la toma del poder por los comunistas con la consiguiente represión y el exilio. La actitud frente a la inexorabilidad de la Historia y del Tiempo, eje del tejido narrativo, revela aquí toda su significación simbólica para el ser humano, marcando la vida y las relaciones sentimentales de los personajes de la novela, inmersos en un torbellino que evoca, con inolvidable realismo, pero sin falta de humor e ironía, el drama de la Europa del Este, condenada, ante la indiferencia de Occidente, a ser objeto, y nunca sujeto, de la historia.",9788425420,9788425420,Paperback,,616 pages,"

Hiding out in a town in rural Italy, she has been staying as far off the map as she can—until she's tracked down by an old colleague. Diego had been a bodyguard in Florence, protecting an engineer and her invention, when they were attacked by a highly trained paramilitary group. Diego alone escaped and the White Scorpions, a Serbian mercenary group known for their indiscriminate violence, are now after him. Well, after him and Daria, now that he's dragged her into the picture.At the same time, a small group of disgraced CIA agents have been waiting for their chance to exact revenge on the person they blame for their discharge—Daria Gibron. When they learn she's in contact with Diego, they get the okay from their former bosses to take her out. With several highly trained teams out to get her, a partner withholding critical information, and a missing invention around which everything turns, Daria is in the worst danger of her life.

","Gastien Beauchamp will discover that destiny has a way of completing what it starts. He is the final link of the Beauchamp destiny – a destiny that will not be denied. Being the new darling of the cutthroat New York City art scene is wonderful, but a kiss from his mentor opened a door to a new and terrifying world. America in the 1940s is no easy place to be gay. His secret could cost him more than just his blossoming career. He could lose his life. As his fame and wealth grow, Gastien’s personal life plummets out of control. Finally embracing who he is, Gastien meets the man of his dreams when he moves to Paris. Unfortunately, that man has vowed to never give love a chance to break his heart again – and everything about Gastien sends loud warning signals to his brain. Gastien wants it all: fame, fortune, and love. Maybe that’s asking for too much. This historical fiction novel is book 5 of a 5 book drama/family saga for adults (The Gastien Series). Each book can stand on its own, but is most compelling read in order.",,,Kindle Edition,1st,408 pages,"

","One of The Barnes and Noble Review Editors' Picks: Best Nonfiction of 2012Selected by The Christian Science Monitor as one of ""21 smart nonfiction titles we think you'll enjoy this summer""Selected by The New Scientist as one of 10 books to look out for in 2012We've long understood black holes to be the points at which the universe as we know it comes to an end. Often billions of times more massive than the Sun, they lurk in the inner sanctum of almost every galaxy of stars in the universe. They're mysterious chasms so destructive and unforgiving that not even light can escape their deadly wrath.Recent research, however, has led to a cascade of new discoveries that have revealed an entirely different side to black holes. As the astrophysicist Caleb Scharf reveals in Gravity's Engines, these chasms in space-time don't just vacuum up everything that comes near them; they also spit out huge beams and clouds of matter. Black holes blow bubbles.With clarity and keen intellect, Scharf masterfully explains how these bubbles profoundly rearrange the cosmos around them. Engaging with our deepest questions about the universe, he takes us on an intimate journey through the endlessly colorful place we call our galaxy and reminds us that the Milky Way sits in a special place in the cosmic zoo—a ""sweet spot"" of properties. Is it coincidental that we find ourselves here at this place and time? Could there be a deeper connection between the nature of black holes and their role in the universe and the phenomenon of life? We are, after all, made of the stuff of stars.",0374114129,9780374114121),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

Each is about to discover the woman who is his perfect match--but perfection doesn't come easily, even for the noble Duke of Ashton. . .Battered by the sea, Adam remembers nothing of his past, his ducal rank, nor of the shipwreck that almost claimed his life. However, he's delighted to hear that the golden-haired vision tending his wounds is his wife. Mariah's name and face may not be familiar, but her touch, her warmth, feel deliciously right. . .When Mariah Clarke prayed for a way to deter a bullying suitor, she didn't imagine she'd find the answer washed ashore on a desolate beach.

","In this fierce essay, leading Bible scholar Scot McKnight tells the story of Junia, a female apostle honored by Paul in his Letter to the Romans--and then silenced and forgotten for most of church history. But Junia's tragedy is not hers alone. She's joined by fellow women in the Bible whose stories of bold leadership have been overlooked. She's in the company of visionary women of God throughout the centuries whose names we've forgotten, whose stories go untold, and whose witness we neglect to celebrate.But Junia is also joined by women today--women who are no longer silent and who are experiencing a re-voicing as they respond to God's call to lead us into all truth.

","Of all of the books in the entire world, there is only one that is free of errors and defects, and that Book is none other than the Noble Quran. The word 'magnificent' is a loose translation of the word that is used in the title of the original Arabic version of this book: 'Adhama. 'Adhama conveys many similar meanings, such as magnificence, grandeur, greatness, exaltedness, and splendor. In the times we live in, great masses of people are ignorant of the greatness and magnificence of the Noble Quran; hence the dire need of books that deal specifically with the subject-matter of this work. The objective of this book is to reveal to readers certain aspects of Quran’s greatness and magnificence. This book shows readers that Allah (SWT) bestowed a great favor upon the Prophet (PBUH) and the people of his nation by giving them the best and most magnificent of all divinely revealed books. The author warns Muslims not to become heedless of the Noble Quran. For it is every Muslim's duty not just to recite the Quran, but also to understand it, to reflect upon its meanings, and to implement its rulings and teachings. This book also corrects some of the more dangerous misconceptions that people have regarding the Noble Quran.",,,ebook,,363 pages,"

","A dazzling blend of military history, high-flying fantasy, and edge-of-your-seat adventure, Naomi Novik’s Temeraire novels, set in an alternate Napoleonic era in which intelligent dragons have been harnessed as weapons of war, are more than just perennial bestsellers—they are a worldwide phenomenon. Now, in Tongues of Serpents, Naomi Novik is back, along with the dragon Temeraire and his rider and friend, Capt. Will Laurence.Convicted of treason despite their heroic defense against Napoleon’s invasion of England, Temeraire and Laurence—stripped of rank and standing—have been transported to the prison colony at New South Wales in distant Australia, where, it is hoped, they cannot further corrupt the British Aerial Corps with their dangerous notions of liberty for dragons. Temeraire and Laurence carry with them three dragon eggs intended to help establish a covert in the colony and destined to be handed over to such second-rate, undesirable officers as have been willing to accept so remote an assignment—including one former acquaintance, Captain Rankin, whose cruelty once cost a dragon its life.Nor is this the greatest difficulty that confronts the exiled dragon and rider: Instead of leaving behind all the political entanglements and corruptions of the war, Laurence and Temeraire have instead sailed into a hornet’s nest of fresh complications. For the colony at New South Wales has been thrown into turmoil after the overthrow of the military governor, one William Bligh—better known as Captain Bligh, late of HMS Bounty. Bligh wastes no time in attempting to enlist Temeraire and Laurence to restore him to office, while the upstart masters of the colony are equally determined that the new arrivals should not upset a balance of power precariously tipped in their favor.    Eager to escape this political quagmire, Laurence and Temeraire take on a mission to find a way through the forbidding Blue Mountains and into the interior of Australia. But when one of the dragon eggs is stolen from Temeraire, the surveying expedition becomes a desperate race to recover it in time—a race that leads to a shocking discovery and a dangerous new obstacle in the global war between Britain and Napoleon.",0345496892,9780345496898),Hardcover,,274 pages,"

","When seventeen-year-old Haley Sullivan is dragged to a corporate party with her parents, she's searching for one thing - the nearest exit. Instead, she finds a mysterious stranger who plays by his own rules and chases his own dreams, and he's definitely cute enough to disappear with for the night. Convinced that he can help her escape the perfectly corporate future that's been planned for her, Haley agrees to meet him the next day. However, Mr. Mysterious is a no show.Determined to track him down, Haley enlists her best friend Linzi to help, but according to the local newspapers, the guy she met has been dead for years. Knowing he's very much alive, Haley and Linzi follow clues on a scavenger-hunt-style road trip that ultimately lands them in the surf town of Crescent Cove, California, where her mystery guy is no mystery at all. He's living as Colby Taylor, the west coast's biggest professional surfer.But talking to the surf star again is nearly impossible when he's guarded by a hierarchy of beach bums who are determined to send Haley back to the east coast. Haley is up for the challenge of submerging herself in their world, from wild summer nights and beach parties to ocean air and secret kisses in the dark, but when the lines blur between the ocean and the shore, she isn't so sure she's here for Colby anymore. Sure, being thrown off a jet ski sucks, but falling in love with one of these California boys might just be worse.(This is book #1 of the Drenaline Surf series but can be read as a stand-alone novel.)​",,,Paperback,"Updated cover, Jan 2014",,"

","Think ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" but with a plot, some mystery, and maybe a ghost. Set in a near future 'now' and marked by moment-to-moment, life-and-death crises that are a practicing veterinarian's life, meet Warren Jeffreys, D.V.M. Raised white, half Cree, he's gifted with animals, but not very people savvy. Struggling to survive his first year in private practice, despite the huge chip on his shoulder, college debt, and a plague of bigotry and prejudice, his bad luck and worse judgment lands him broke and homeless, camping out with vagrants and vagabonds. He's cleansing cows and cutting up dead lambs inside bawling ewes—an animal mechanic working for a small-time veterinary service in rural North Idaho. As his hopes for prestige and preeminence buckle under the rigors of day-to-day practice, he finds a new dream—a reconciliation to home and family—and with it comes a certain peace…until, once again, as fame and fortune tempt, he faces hard choices. Filled with intense, critical emergencies, all of them based on true cases, the book has been “vetted” by modern, practicing veterinarians. It's the animals that make you really pull for Dr. Warren Jeffreys, because, despite his best attempts not to, he cares. A lot. And, because he cares, because he competes against death, regardless the odds, he makes a difference. Unfortunately, the often cantankerous farm folk he serves don’t always appreciate his efforts and skill. Nor do they trust him, the ""too tall, long-haired Injun."" Warren truly is a man without a home, with a foot in two worlds, but welcome in neither until he learns to trust his own heart. EXCERPT FROM A REVIEW BY Clayton C. Bye of Chase Enterprises Publishing Set against the background of constant veterinary emergencies, Warrens story unwinds before our eyes. But to the author's credit, both in personal knowledge and her research skills, this novel doesn't just gloss over these emergencies, but rather it gives us a detailed look inside the world of treating farm animals, pets and, of course, horses--jumpers, racers, studs, pregnant mares, etc. It is as if [E. J. Ruek] has lived each moment and has stood in the shoes of this awesome breed that is the country vet. Never have I read a story like this one. Old Hickory Lane is the book that All Creatures Great and Small should have been. The novel has all the characters: quirky, bitter, angry, rude, stand offish, passionate, caring and otherwise. Similarly, Ruek treats her animals like the intelligent and full-of-character beings they are. And when something goes wrong, her vet(s) perform detailed procedures and surgeries that only a true insider would know. For realism at its finest and for the very best in heart stopping drama, I award this novel...5 stars and the Chase Enterprises Publishing Award of Excellence!",,,Kindle Edition,First Electronic,318 pages,"

Terrified and powerless at the foot of Molech's altar, Hezekiah encounters for the first time the one true God of his royal ancestry, Yahweh. But his journey to the Holy One is riddled by influence from an assortment of men: Zechariah, a grandfather of noble standing who has fallen into drunkenness; Uriah, the High Priest whose lust for power forces him to gamble the faith he proclaims; and Shebna, the Egyptian intellectual who guides Hezekiah's instruction. For the two women who love Hezekiah, the meaning of love--and its sacrificial essence--will direct the course of their lives and help shape the young prince's future.",0764229893,9780764229893),Paperback,,317 pages,"

The story is complete with twenty-seven recipes from the life and tumultuous times of Eden Douglass. Eden was born in 1920 into a contentious California tribe, and the ingredients of her life include her grandmother's reserve, her aunt's instinct for action, and her mother's foggy warmth.  Seasoned with spicy herbs, and a few bitter ones, simmered and stirred over time, these instincts shape her destiny. Two strong-willed women--her grandmother Ruth Douglass and her aunt Afton Lance--struggle to pull Eden from the comfy sloth of her parents' home.  Her ill-matched parents drift toward financial collapse, and her father, pursuing phantom wealth, takes the family to an Idaho mining town.  He finds fulfillment in Idaho, but Eden's mother breaks down, and Eden must shoulder the household drudgery, burdens not in keeping with her aspirations to be a journalist.Eden's adventurous spirit takes her far from her faith and family.  She falls in love in wartime London and rides a motorcycle across war-torn Belgium.  After the war, still reeling from a devastating loss, Eden returns to Southern California and is hired by a newspaper, only to confront insidious opposition, yet find an unexpected ally. Then, in 1952, fate puts Eden Douglass in the path of a runaway horse at Greenwater Movie Ranch, where they're filing a B-movie Western.  She falls flat on her face, and Matt March lifts her from the dust.  Charming and charismatic, with good looks, cowboy boots, and appetite for life, and his VistaVision of the Western, Matt ignites Eden's passion.  Three months later, they elope to Mexico. In these exuberant California boom years, Eden nourishes Matt's dreams, even though they are sauced with secrets and larded with debt.  He tests Eden's strengths and his children's love. A big-cast book, American Cookery fulfills the wide embrace of its title.  The novel chronicles the stories behind family recipes and the lives that touch Eden's--lives of horse thieves, ranchers, railroad men, developers, dreamers, migrants, immigrants, natives, Latter-Day Saints, sinners, silent-film stars, sidekicks, and stunt people. The good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful emerge in these pages as American Cookery serves up the whole gorgeous banquet of life.",0312348118,9780312348113),Hardcover,,419 pages,"

","Super-spy Mykola Chernichenko comes from a family of geniuses, and though he's no idiot himself, he'd rather be where the action is than analyze it to death. That's why his vacation has just been cut short by a call to get two of his siblings out of some serious trouble--while protecting a nerdy scientist whose latest project could change the world...and get her killed.The guy who'd rather act than think guarding an egghead in a lab coat? Myk would appreciate the irony more if he weren't so busy trying to figure out how, exactly, to get under said lab coat. Because Lana Ericson just happens to be the hottest thing working the scientific method since, well, ever. Myk has a feeling Lana's laser-like focus would translate to something equally intense in the bedroom.

","From the bestselling author of Tenth of December comes a splendid new edition of his acclaimed collaboration with the illustrator behind The Stinky Cheese Man and James and the Giant Peach! Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious images, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a modern fable for people of all ages that touches on the power of kindness, generosity, compassion, and community. In the seaside village of Frip live three families: the Romos, the Ronsens, and a little girl named Capable and her father. The economy of Frip is based solely on goat’s milk, and this is a problem because the village is plagued by gappers: bright orange, many-eyed creatures the size of softballs that love to attach themselves to goats. When a gapper gets near a goat, it lets out a high-pitched shriek of joy that puts the goats off giving milk, which means that every few hours the children of Frip have to go outside, brush the gappers off their goats, and toss them into the sea. The gappers have always been everyone’s problem, until one day they get a little smarter, and instead of spreading out, they gang up: on Capable’s goats. Free at last of the tyranny of the gappers, will her neighbors rally to help her? Or will they turn their backs, forcing Capable to bear the misfortune alone? Featuring fifty-two haunting and hilarious illustrations by Lane Smith and a brilliant story by George Saunders that explores universal themes of community and kindness, The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is a rich and resonant story for those that have all and those that have not.Praise for The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip“In a perfect world, every child would own a copy of this profound, funny fable. . . . Every adult would own a copy too, and would marvel at how this smart, subversive little book is even deeper and more hilarious than any child could know.”—Entertainment Weekly “Saunders’s idiosyncratic voice makes an almost perfect accompaniment to children’s book illustrator Smith’s heightened characterizations and slightly surreal backdrops.”—Publishers Weekly “A riveting, funny, and sly new fairy tale.”—Miami Herald",1932416374,9781932416374),Hardcover,,84 pages,"

","'...And then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped.' Harriet TubmanIn five years, Jesmyn Ward lost five men in her life, to drugs, accidents, suicide, and the bad luck that can follow people who live in poverty, particularly black men. Dealing with these losses, one after another, made Jesmyn ask the question: why? And as she began to write about the experience of living through all the dying, she realized the truth--and it took her breath away. Her brother and her friends all died because of who they were and where they were from, because they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle that fostered drug addiction and the dissolution of family and relationships. Jesmyn says the answer was so obvious she felt stupid for not seeing it. But it nagged at her until she knew she had to write about her community, to write their stories and her own. Jesmyn grew up in poverty in rural Mississippi. She writes powerfully about the pressures this brings, on the men who can do no right and the women who stand in for family in a society where the men are often absent. She bravely tells her story, revisiting the agonizing losses of her only brother and her friends. As the sole member of her family to leave home and pursue high education, she writes about this parallel American universe with the objectivity distance provides and the intimacy of utter familiarity.",160819521X,9781608195213),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

It was this incident that made him decide to turn his life around. A hardscrabble wrestler who had been told that he didn't have what it took to make it in professional wrestling, Batista took that as a personal challenge and signed with WWE. His determination to come back from injuries and the heart he shows in the ring have won him countless fans. More than once, on the brink of success, he has had it torn from him until finally, in 2007, he became WWE World Heavyweight Champion.

","Fifteen-year-old Bridget Liu just wants to be left alone: by her overprotective mom, by the hunky son of the police officer who got her father killed, and by the eerie voices which she can suddenly and inexplicably hear. Turns out the voices are demons - the Biblical kind, not the Buffy kind - and Bridget possesses the rare ability to banish them.San Francisco's senior exorcist and his newly assigned partner from the Vatican enlist Bridget's help with increasingly bizarre and dangerous cases of demonic possession. But when one of Bridget's oldest friends turns up dead in a ritualistic sacrifice that mirrors her father's murder, Bridget realizes she can't trust anyone. An interview with her father's murderer reveals a link between Bridget and the Emim: a race of part-demons intent on raising their forefathers to the earth in human form. Now Bridget must unlock the secret to the Emim's plan before someone else close to her winds up dead, or worse - the human vessel for a Demon King.",0062060716,9780062060716),Hardcover,First Edition,382 pages,"

","From the acclaimed author of Atticus and Mariette in Ecstasy comes a stylish novel set in the hard-drinking, fast-living New York City of the Jazz Age that follows two lovers in a torrid affair on an arc of murder and sexual self-destruction. Based on a real case whose lurid details scandalized Americans in 1927 and sold millions of newspapers, acclaimed novelist Ron Hansen’s latest work is a tour de force of erotic tension and looming violence. Trapped in a loveless marriage, Ruth Snyder is a voluptuous, reckless, and altogether irresistible woman who wishes not only to escape her husband but that he die—and the sooner the better. No less miserable in his own tedious marriage is Judd Gray, a dapper corset-and-brassiere salesman who travels the Northeast peddling his wares. He meets Ruth in a Manhattan diner, and soon they are conducting a white-hot affair involving hotel rooms, secret letters, clandestine travels, and above all, Ruth’s increasing insistence that Judd kill her husband. Could he do it? Would he? What follows is a thrilling exposition of a murder plan, a police investigation, the lovers’ attempt to escape prosecution, and a final reckoning for both of them that lays bare the horror and sorrow of what they have done. Dazzlingly well-written and artfully constructed, this impossible-to-put-down story marks the return of an American master known for his elegant and vivid novels that cut cleanly to the essence of the human heart, always and at once mysterious and filled with desire.",1451617550,9781451617559),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","This book offers a complete translation of the Digha Nikaya, the long discourses of the Buddha, one of the major collections of texts in the Pali Canon, the authorized scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. This collection--among the oldest records of the historical Buddha's original teachings, given in India two and a half thousand years ago--consists of thirty-four longer-length suttas, or discourses, distinguished as such from the middle-length and shorter suttas of the other collections.These suttas reveal the gentleness, compassion, power, and penetrating wisdom of the Buddha. Included are teachings on mindfulness (Mahasatipatthana Sutta); on morality, concentration, and wisdom (Subha Sutta); on dependent origination (Mahanidrana Sutta); on the roots and causes of wrong views (Brahmajala Sutta); and a long description of the Buddha's last days and passing away (Mahaparinibbana Sutta); along with a wealth of practical advice and insight for all those travelling along the spiritual path.Venerable Sumedho Thera writes in his foreword: ""[These suttas] are not meant to be 'sacred scriptures' that tell us what to believe. One should read them, listen to them, think about them, contemplate them, and investigate the present reality, the present experience, with them. Then, and only then, can one insightfully know the truth beyond words.""Introduced with a vivid account of the Buddha's life and times and a short survey of his teachings, The Long Discourses of the Buddha brings us closer in every way to the wise and compassionate presence of Gotama Buddha and his path of truth.",0861711033,9780861711031),Hardcover,,648 pages,"

And then there's the runner who simply vanished one day. Joe doesn't mind admitting that the farther he rides, the more he wishes he could just turn around and go home. And he is right to be concerned. Because what awaits him is like nothing he's ever dealt with, like something out of an old story, except this is all too real and too deadly.

The literary master, then seventy-one, accepted the offer, which led to a twelve-year-long apprenticeship for Telushkin.Throughout Dvorah Telushkin's tenure with Singer, she kept detailed diaries chronicling both their literary efforts and the evolution of their personal relationship. Indeed, Telushkin was the one person to whom Singer tried to teach his craft as a writer. She writes about the great moments in Singer's public life, his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978, his fiery encounter with the Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, his surprising meeting with Barbra Streisand, who adapted and starred in the movie version of Singer's short story ""Yentl.""

","The Parallax View is Slavoj Zizek's most substantial theoretical work to appear in many years; Zizek himself describes it as his magnum opus. Parallax can be defined as the apparent displacement of an object, caused by a change in observational position. Zizek is interested in the ""parallax gap"" separating two points between which no synthesis or mediation is possible, linked by an ""impossible short circuit"" of levels that can never meet. From this consideration of parallax, Zizek begins a rehabilitation of dialectical materialism.Modes of parallax can be seen in different domains of today's theory, from the wave-particle duality in quantum physics to the parallax of the unconscious in Freudian psychoanalysis between interpretations of the formation of the unconscious and theories of drives. In The Parallax View, Zizek, with his usual astonishing erudition, focuses on three main modes of parallax: the ontological difference, the ultimate parallax that conditions our very access to reality; the scientific parallax, the irreducible gap between the phenomenal experience of reality and its scientific explanation, which reaches its apogee in today's brain sciences (according to which ""nobody is home"" in the skull, just stacks of brain meat--a condition Zizek calls ""the unbearable lightness of being no one""); and the political parallax, the social antagonism that allows for no common ground. Between his discussions of these three modes, Zizek offers interludes that deal with more specific topics--including an ethical act in a novel by Henry James and anti-anti-Semitism.The Parallax View not only expands Zizek's Lacanian-Hegelian approach to new domains (notably cognitive brain sciences) but also provides the systematic exposition of the conceptual framework that underlies his entire work. Philosophical and theological analysis, detailed readings of literature, cinema, and music coexist with lively anecdotes and obscene jokes. This is Zizek at the height of his powers, both as a writer and a thinker.",0262240513,9780262240512),Hardcover,,433 pages,"

","""Greetings from the dead,"" declares Maxwell Broadbent on the videotape he left behind after his mysterious disappearance. A notorious treasure hunter and tomb robber, Broadbent accumulated over a half a billion dollars' worth of priceless art, gems, and artifacts before vanishing---along with his entire collection---from his mansion in New Mexico.At first, robbery is suspected, but the truth proves far stranger: As a final challenge to his three sons, Broadbent has buried himself and his treasure somewhere in the world, hidden away like an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.

","SOME LAWS YOU BREAK. SOME BREAK YOU.AND THEN THERE’S CAINE’S LAW. From the moment Caine first appeared in the pages of Heroes Die, two things were clear. First, that Matthew Stover was one of the most gifted fantasy writers of his generation. And second, that Caine was a hero whose peers go by such names as Conan and Elric. Like them, Caine was something new: a civilized man who embraced savagery, an actor whose life was a lie, a force of destruction so potent that even gods thought twice about crossing him. Now Stover brings back his greatest creation for his most stunning performance yet.Caine is washed up and hung out to dry, a crippled husk kept isolated and restrained by the studio that exploited him. Now they have dragged him back for one last deal. But Caine has other plans. Those plans take him back to Overworld, the alternate reality where gods are real and magic is the ultimate weapon. There, in a violent odyssey through time and space, Caine will face the demons of his past, find true love, and just possibly destroy the universe. Hey, it’s a crappy job, but somebody’s got to do it.From the Trade Paperback edition.",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged,,"

","The latest in the New York Times bestselling Cork O’Connor mystery series—the action never stops when the private detective ends up in the crosshairs of a political assassin.
The dying don’t easily become the dead.
 The next novel in William Kent Krueger’s New York Times bestselling series finds Cork O’Connor sitting in the shadow of a towering monolith known as Trickster’s Point, deep in the Minnesota wilderness. With him is Jubal Little, who is favored to become the first Native American elected governor of Minnesota, and who is slowly dying with an arrow through his heart. Although the men have been bowhunting, a long-standing tradition among these two friends, this is no hunting accident. The arrow turns out to be one of Cork’s, and he becomes the primary suspect in the murder. He understands full well that he’s been set up. As he works to clear his name and track the real killer, he remembers his long, complex relationship with the tough kid who would grow up to become a professional football player, a populist politician, and the lover of the first woman to whom Cork ever gave his heart. Jubal was known by many for his passion, his loyalty, and his ambition. Only Cork knows that he was capable of murder. Full of nail-biting suspense, plus a fascinating look into Cork’s teenage years in Aurora, a town blessed with natural beauty yet plagued by small-town feuds and heated racial tension, Trickster’s Point is a thrilling exploration of the motives, both good and ill, that lead men and women into the difficult, sometimes deadly, political arena.",1451645678,9781451645675),Hardcover,,329 pages,"

","L.E. Modesitt's bestselling fantasy novels set in the world of Recluce are among the most popular in contemporary fantasy. Rich in detail, Modesitt's Recluce books are a feast of wonderous marvels. Booklist notes, ""Modesitt's elaborate and intelligent working out of a system of magic and a system of technology parallel to it is becoming more the lifeblood of the Recluce books with every new volume. . . his saga continues to gain in popularity.""The White Order is the story of Cerryl, a boy orphaned when the powerful white mages killed his father to protect their control of the world's magic. Cerryl, raised by his aunt and uncle, is a curious boy, attracted to mirrors and books, though he is unable to read. When he is old enough, Cerryl is apprenticed to the local miller. The miller's daughter teaches Cerryl to read his father's books, and it seems that the talent for magic has been passed from father to son. When Cerryl witnesses a white mage destroy a renegade magician, the miller realizes the boy will not be safe there, so Cerryl must be sent to the city of Fairhaven to find his destiny.Thus Modesitt takes one of the most enduring and mythic themes in fantasy and makes it his own. The White Order is a powerful new addition to the Recluce saga, guaranteed to add many new readers to Modesitt's devoted following.The White Order is the eighth book in the saga of Recluce.",0812541715,9780812541717),Mass Market Paperback,,468 pages,"

","Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight, and DiseaseIn this groundbreaking book, the result of seven years of research in every science connected with the impact of nutrition on health, award-winning science writer Gary Taubes shows us that almost everything we believe about the nature of a healthy diet is wrong.For decades we have been taught that fat is bad for us, carbohydrates better, and that the key to a healthy weight is eating less and exercising more. Yet with more and more people acting on this advice, we have seen unprecedented epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Taubes argues persuasively that the problem lies in refined carbohydrates (white flour, sugar, easily digested starches) and sugars–via their dramatic and longterm effects on insulin, the hormone that regulates fat accumulation–and that the key to good health is the kind of calories we take in, not the number. There are good calories, and bad ones.Good CaloriesThese are from foods without easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. These foods can be eaten without restraint.Meat, fish, fowl, cheese, eggs, butter, and non-starchy vegetables. Bad CaloriesThese are from foods that stimulate excessive insulin secretion and so make us fat and increase our risk of chronic disease—all refined and easily digestible carbohydrates and sugars. The key is not how much vitamins and minerals they contain, but how quickly they are digested. (So apple juice or even green vegetable juices are not necessarily any healthier than soda.) Bread and other baked goods, potatoes, yams, rice, pasta, cereal grains, corn, sugar (sucrose and high fructose corn syrup), ice cream, candy, soft drinks, fruit juices, bananas and other tropical fruits, and beer. Taubes traces how the common assumption that carbohydrates are fattening was abandoned in the 1960s when fat and cholesterol were blamed for heart disease and then –wrongly–were seen as the causes of a host of other maladies, including cancer. He shows us how these unproven hypotheses were emphatically embraced by authorities in nutrition, public health, and clinical medicine, in spite of how well-conceived clinical trials have consistently refuted them. He also documents the dietary trials of carbohydrate-restriction, which consistently show that the fewer carbohydrates we consume, the leaner we will be. With precise references to the most significant existing clinical studies, he convinces us that there is no compelling scientific evidence demonstrating that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease, that salt causes high blood pressure, and that fiber is a necessary part of a healthy diet. Based on the evidence that does exist, he leads us to conclude that the only healthy way to lose weight and remain lean is to eat fewer carbohydrates or to change the type of the carbohydrates we do eat, and, for some of us, perhaps to eat virtually none at all.The 11 Critical Conclusions of Good Calories, Bad Calories: 1. Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, does not cause heart disease. 2. Carbohydrates do, because of their effect on the hormone insulin. The more easily-digestible and refined the carbohydrates and the more fructose they contain, the greater the effect on our health, weight, and well-being. 3. Sugars—sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup specifically—are particularly harmful. The glucose in these sugars raises insulin levels; the fructose they contain overloads the liver.4. Refined carbohydrates, starches, and sugars are also the most likely dietary causes of cancer, Alzheimer’s Disease, and the other common chronic diseases of modern times. 5. Obesity is a disorder of excess fat accumulation, not overeating and not sedentary behavior. 6. Consuming excess calories does not cause us to grow fatter any more than it causes a child to grow taller. 7. Exercise does not make us lose excess fat; it makes us hungry. 8. We get fat because of an imbalance—a disequilibrium—in the hormonal regulation of fat tissue and fat metabolism. More fat is stored in the fat tissue than is mobilized and used for fuel. We become leaner when the hormonal regulation of the fat tissue reverses this imbalance. 9. Insulin is the primary regulator of fat storage. When insulin levels are elevated, we stockpile calories as fat. When insulin levels fall, we release fat from our fat tissue and burn it for fuel. 10. By stimulating insulin secretion, carbohydrates make us fat and ultimately cause obesity. By driving fat accumulation, carbohydrates also increase hunger and decrease the amount of energy we expend in metabolism and physical activity.11. The fewer carbohydrates we eat, the leaner we will be. Good Calories, Bad Calories is a tour de force of scientific investigation–certain to redefine the ongoing debate about the foods we eat and their effects on our health.From the Hardcover edition.",1400033462,9781400033461),Paperback,,634 pages,"

","Tatkala dunia Barat menurun setelah Imperium Romawi runtuh, sebuah peradaban baru—peradaban Arab-Muslim—muncul di Timur, mencapai puncak awalnya di Baghdad di bawah Harun ar-Rasyid, khalifah legendaris negeri Seribu Satu Malam, yang kekuasaanya di dunia nyata semegah kisahnya dalam cerita fiksi.Ketika Harun berkuasa, Islam membentang dari Samudra Atlantik ke China, dan imperium Muslim merupakan kekuasaan terkuat dan terbesar. Meski Islam menyebar terutama melalui perang, kaum Muslim mencapai prestasi budaya amat besar—hingga berabad-abad berikutnya, peradaban Arab-Muslim memberi dampak “abadi” terhadap Barat dalam astronomi, geometri, aljabar, obat-obatan, kimia, dan ilmu pengetahuan lainnya. Dari teknik, fashion, hingga persenjataan, pengaruh Arab-Muslim membentuk dunia Barat, begitu pula bidang hukum, musik, dan sastra.Dalam buku memikat ini, Benson Bobrick menceritakan kenaikan Harun ar-Rasyid ke tampuk kekuasaan, juga keagungan dan pengaruhnya yang luas. Perseteruan berabad-abad antara bangsa Arab dan Byzantium pun tak luput dari penuturan. Bahkan, melemah hingga jatuhnya kekhalifahan Baghdad akibat friksi internal keluarga istana terkisahkan pula secara dramatis. Dan, buku ini begitu terang merekam zaman keemasan Islam beserta kontribusi permanennya bagi peradaban yang terus terasa sampai kini.",,,Paperback,,416 pages,"

","Then she opened her mouth to scream—and recognised me. It was what I’d been waiting for. She froze. She looked into my eyes. She said, “It’s you.” Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but you’d never suspect it. Nonstop sex and exercise will do that for you—and a diet with lots of animal protein. Jake is a werewolf, and after the unfortunate and violent death of his one contemporary, he is now the last of his species. Although he is physically healthy, Jake is deeply distraught and lonely.Jake’s depression has carried him to the point where he is actually contemplating suicide—even if it means terminating a legend thousands of years old. It would seem to be easy enough for him to end everything. But for very different reasons there are two dangerous groups pursuing him who will stop at nothing to keep him alive.Here is a powerful, definitive new version of the werewolf legend—mesmerising and incredibly sexy. In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century—a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human.

","BESTSELLING AUTHORS GO HOLMES—IN AN IRRESISTIBLE NEW COLLECTION edited by award-winning Sherlockians Laurie R. King and Leslie S. Klinger Neil Gaiman. Laura Lippman. Lee Child. These are just three of eighteen superstar authors who provide fascinating, thrilling, and utterly original perspectives on Sherlock Holmes in this one-of-a-kind book. These modern masters place the sleuth in suspenseful new situations, create characters who solve Holmesian mysteries, contemplate Holmes in his later years, fill gaps in the Sherlock Holmes Canon, and reveal their own personal obsessions with the Great Detective.Thomas Perry, for example, has Dr. Watson tell his tale, in a virtuoso work of alternate history that finds President McKinley approaching the sleuth with a disturbing request; Lee Child sends an FBI agent to investigate a crime near today’s Baker Street—only to get a twenty-first-century shock; Jacqueline Winspear spins a story of a plucky boy inspired by the detective to make his own deductions; and graphic artist Colin Cotterill portrays his struggle to complete this assignment in his hilarious “The Mysterious Case of the Unwritten Short Story.”*In perfect tribute comes this delicious collection of twisty, clever, and enthralling studies of a timeless icon.Featuring stories from Alan BradleyTony BroadbentJan BurkeLionel ChetwyndLee ChildColin Cotterill*Neil GaimanLaura LippmanGayle Lynds & John SheldonPhillip & Jerry MargolinMargaret MaronThomas PerryS.

","Author of The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand (1905-1982) is one of the most widely read philosophers of the twentieth century. Yet, despite the sale of nearly thirty million copies of her works, there have been few extended scholarly examinations of her thought. Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical provides the first comprehensive analysis of the intellectual roots and philosophy of this controversial thinker. Chris Sciabarra views Rand's ""Objectivism"" as a rejection - and affirmation - of key elements in the Russian tradition. Born in Russia during the Silver Age, Rand was educated at Leningrad University and studied with N. O. Lossky. She absorbed a dialectical method of inquiry that profoundly influenced her literary and philosophic project. Her distinctive libertarian synthesis is presented as a major contribution to radical social theory. Ultimately, Sciabarra challenges Rand's followers and critics to reassess her thought and its place in intellectual history.",0271014415,9780271014418),Paperback,,477 pages,"

","Welcome to the Nightingale Scripts. This book consists of a film script entitled Night And Day and the pilot episode for a TV series entitled White Gold Las Vegas. Please read and find out what my vision was for these two projects which were sadly never made. I’ve decided to release them in book form because I believe that if we give up on our dreams that we give up on ourselves. Jason Nightingale (Still Undiscovered 2014)WHITE GOLDSERIES 1 SYNOPSIS Retired New York Mob captain Johnny Rizzo moves to Las Vegas, attracted in part by the glamour and excess of the city. Rich beyond his wildest dreams and too young for a retirement home, 35 year old Johnny finds himself in the Strip, on what originally was intended to be an extended holiday. Lucky enough to have come out of a life in the Mafia in one piece, and with the dangers of what he used to do in the past, Johnny finds unexpected peace in the world’s gambling mecca. Contentment and happiness is an usual feeling for Johnny, and the main reason for this is Julia. Womanising and hard drinking Johnny finds himself in love for the first time in his life with the attractive and charismatic Julia. Three months later they are married and Julia is pregnant. Johnny never expected to be able to lead a normal life and finds it hard to hide his joy but unfortunately it all comes to an end when he is shot and dies Julia’s arms. However this isn’t where our story ends, it’s where it begins for when Johnny’s old partner in crime, Sebastian Romano, hears of his murder he leaves his luxury life in Florida and arrives in Las Vegas determined to have revenge on Johnny’s killers. Sebastian and Johnny grew up together on the tough streets of New York. As kids they only had two ambitions, money and power. Johnny ended up joining the mafia and Sebastian became a corrupt NYPD officer. Together they became powerful figures in the New York underworld, and now Sebastian’s only desire is for revenge. NIGHT AND DAY BY JASON NIGHTINGALENight and Day is a criminal comedy centred around Ismail a hapless min-cab driver. Ismail is down on his luck, a bankrupt restaurant owner he is now forced to work Night and Day driving various clients around London until a chance meeting with Janet, a highly attractive client, lures him into the murky world of hi-tech crime and the Turkish mafia. Janet is an experienced hacker and well used by Turkish gang leader Mustafa Karadayi. Madly in love with Janet, the far from brave Ismail, in part forced by the police takes on Mustafa Karadayi’s gang in a game of sleuth and wits. Most of the film’s comic moments come from Ismail’s lack of bravery in certain situations. Yet the irony is that he is risking his life for a woman he hardly knows. Ismail forms a plan, to play the police and the Turkish gang off, against each other, and therefore escape with Janet in the resulting confusion.Will Ismail’s plan come off or will he and Janet be killed by the gangsters? Or will Ismail spend the rest of his life behind bars? Does Janet even love him? All is revealed at the end of this fast paced and entertaining film script.",,,Kindle Edition,1,207 pages,"

","Every generation rediscovers Jane Austen with a renewed passion for her timeless stories of romance, family relations, and foibles of human nature. Today she is more popular than ever. Natalie Tyler captures the essence of this enthusiasm in a book that shuns obscure academic approaches and provides lively discussions about every one of Austen's novels and characters. Readers can experience the highlights of Austen's early writings, learn about the man who almost won her hand, and puzzle over what on earth she meant by the last line of Persuasion. Tyler includes quizzes, eye-catching illustrations, interviews with Austen scholars and lovers of her work-such as Jane Smiley, T. C. Boyle, and Miss Manners-plus a filmography, a bibliography, and browsable quotes and sidebars to create this wildly entertaining Austen companion.",0141001925,9780141001920),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","La rebeldía es un acto de la consciencia que se hace contra algo que se quiere cambiar. Pero también se apaga con la misma rapidez e intensidad con la que surge: los guerreros rebeldes dejan de serlo cuando toman el poder; los artistas, cuando su obra es aceptada.  Desde ese punto de vista, no puede decirse que Olivia Hamilton se rebele. Ella, simplemente, es distinta, y nada puede hacerla cambiar. Si usa ropa de varón, lo hace ya que resulta más cómoda para montar; si se duerme en clase, se debe a que no quiere saber la aburrida lista de formas de cortesía con la que tiene que dirigirse a un conde o a un duque; si dice las cosas tal cual son, es porque detesta la hipocresía. De eso, claro, hay mucho en el colegio de señoritas en el que está recluida por decisión de sus padres con el objetivo de encauzarla.  Alexander Sinclair, duque de Ashford, mentor del internado para muchachas que está en sus tierras, sonríe una o dos veces al año. Con un pasado sombrío, con varios desengaños a cuestas, apenas se interesa por las mujeres lo justo como para saciar sus necesidades y aspirar a que una le provea un heredero.  Sin embargo, se cruzará con Olivia y el impacto será como el de un choque de planetas: nada de lo conocido podía prepararlos para ese encuentro en el que el carácter y la sensualidad desbordarán. La escena está preparada, la trama dispuesta con la claridad que puede ver una quiromántica que sepa leer la línea del corazón de las manos de Olivia y Alexander.  Con protagonistas profundos y complejos, con personajes secundarios deliciosos que parecen querer salir del papel y materializarse, Lena Michell nos trae una novela adorable e irreverente, de las que permanecen en la memoria mucho después de terminar la lectura.",,,Paperback,,354 pages,"

","In a team that included some famously heavy drinkers, and players who did not always set the highest standards in their behaviour, Dennis Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal and soon everything changed. Along with the likes of Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira, he provided an inspirational cutting edge to the Gunners' play and set them on the way to becoming one of the most formidable sides in the world, winning trophy after trophy. In 2003-04, Arsenal were quite literally unbeatable in the league. Now, with unique insight and eloquent recall, Bergkamp reveals how it was done and explains his footballing philosophy - a way of playing that has been handed down from Cruyff and the era of Dutch 'Total Football' via Arsene Wenger and on today to Pep Guardiola. But, now at Ajax, he is part of a team that is working to create a way of playing football that could take the game on to a whole new level. Whether you want to relive the glories of his past, or share his vision of the future, once you have read this book you will never see Bergkamp or football in the same way again.",1471129519,9781471129513),Hardcover,,269 pages,"

","In the heart of New York City, hidden in the back room of an old Laundromat, are nine rare and valuable plants. Hothouse Flower and the Nine Plants of Desire tells the story of this legendary garden, and the distance one woman must travel—from the cold, harsh streets of Manhattan to the lush jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula—to claim what is hers.Lila Nova lives alone in a plain, white box of an apartment. Recovering from a heartbreaking divorce, Lila’s life is like her home: simple, new, and empty. But when she meets a handsome plant-seller named David Exley, an entire world opens up before her eyes. Late one night Lila stumbles across a strange Laundromat and sees ferns so highly-prized that a tiny cutting can fetch thousands of dollars. She learns about flowers with medicinal properties to rival anything found in drugstores. And she hears the legend of nine mystical plants that bring fame, fortune, immortality, and passion. The owner of the Laundromat, Armand, presents Lila with a test: if she can make the cutting from a fire fern grow roots, he will show her the secret of his locked room. But Lila is too trusting, and with one terrible mistake she ruins her chance to see Armand’s plants. The only way to win it back is to travel, on her own, to the Yucatan. Deep in the rain forests of Mexico, Lila enters a world of shamans and spirit animals, snake charmers, and sexy, heart-stopping Huichols. Alone in the jungle, Lila is forced to learn more than she ever wanted to know about nature—and about herself. An exhilarating journey of love and self-discovery, Hothouse Flower and the Nine Plants of Desire brings together mystery, adventure, and heat, in every sense of the word.",0307377849,9780307377845),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Zum ersten Mal als Taschenbuch: der letzte Roman Erich Maria Remarques – ein Vermächtnis!Er blieb Fragment und fasziniert dennoch nachhaltig: Der Roman »Das gelobte Land«, an dem Remarque bis zu seinem Tod im September 1970 arbeitete, bietet ein schillerndes Bild des New York der Vierzigerjahre, der Weltmetropole, Kunststadt und Emigrantenhochburg.Ludwig Sommer hat es geschafft: Er ist als deutscher Flüchtling dem Naziregime entkommen und mit jüdischem Pass auf Umwegen nach New York gelangt. Er findet Anschluss an die Emigrantenszene und Anstellung bei einem Kunsthändler. Binnen Kurzem steht ihm das gesellschaftliche Leben der Stadt offen, er bewegt sich zwischen rauschenden Festen, teuren Restaurants und exklusiven Appartements – und doch kann er die Unbeschwertheit nicht zurückgewinnen. Erinnerungen an die Flucht suchen ihn heim, an die Monate in einem Versteck unter einem belgischen Museum und die Gefangenschaft in einem deutschen Konzentrationslager, wo er Zeuge der Ermordung seines Vaters wurde. Während er aufgrund seines Kunstverstands und seines kaufmännischen Geschicks immer erfolgreicher wird, quält ihn die Frage, ob ein Leben im Angesicht des Holocaust moralisch überhaupt vertretbar ist. Die Nachricht von der Befreiung Paris’ weckt Hoffnung auf eine Rückkehr und die Aussicht auf Rache, doch als kurz darauf Jessie Stein, eine selbstlose Unterstützerin der Emigranten, schwer erkrankt, entschließt sich Sommer zu bleiben. Und dann eröffnet sich die Möglichkeit, seiner Geliebten Maria Fiola nach Hollywood zu folgen.Das Ende bleibt offen, mehrere Skizzen Remarques sind überliefert, aber das Nachwort von Tilmann Westphalen liefert Aufschluss über die Entstehungsgeschichte und das mögliche Ende.",3462042661,9783462042665),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","After several decades of looking for true love and never finding it, aging model and lingerie designer, Alexa Ranger, has finally given up the search. A couple years ago, she got tired of the game completely and just stopped dating. Now friends and family keep her mostly content, so it’s shocking at 50 yrs old to find herself suddenly wanting a sex life again. It’s even more shocking to be attracted to a much younger man this time. She definitely thinks medically retired Marine, Casey Carter is sexy, but can’t get passed their twelve year age difference to even consider a fling. Not that it matters anyway, anything resembling a normal dating relationship is totally out of the question because Casey is related to and living with her daughter’s boyfriend. The very last thing Alexa needs is yet another talk-show worthy drama in her already complicated life, no matter how amazing Casey’s kisses make her feel.***This is a great character study in romance and the first of the series. I can't wait to read them all. I definitely recommend this author and her books to anyone who loves a good romance and likes to laugh. And keep an eye out for more from this wonderful lady. ~ Jesse V. Coffey, National Examiner and On Air Host of Edin Road Radio",,,Kindle Edition,,282 pages,"

The scope and breadth of Kim’s talent is evident on every page of this breathtaking novel.” —ListIn 1904, as the Russo-Japanese War deepened, Asia was parceled out to rising powers and the Korean empire was annexed by Japan. Facing war and the loss of their nation, more than a thousand Koreans left their homes to seek possibility elsewhere—in unknown Mexico.After a long sea voyage, these emigrants—thieves and royals, priests and soldiers, orphans and entire families—disembark with the promise of land. Soon they discover the truth: they have been sold into indentured servitude.Aboard ship, an orphan, Ijeong, fell in love with the daughter of a noble; separated when the various haciendados claim their laborers, he vows to find her. After years of working in the punishing heat of the henequen fields, the Koreans are caught in the midst of a Mexican revolution. Some flee with Ijeong to Guatemala, where they found a New Korea amid Mayan ruins. A tale of star-crossed love, political turmoil, and the dangers of seeking freedom in a new world, Black Flower is an epic story based on a little-known moment in history.",0547691130,9780547691138),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Jessamy ""Jess"" Harrison is eight years old. Sensitive, whimsical, possessed of an extraordinary and powerful imagination, she spends hours writing haiku, reading Shakespeare, or simply hiding in the dark warmth of the airing cupboard. As the child of an English father and a Nigerian mother, Jess just can't shake off the feeling of being alone wherever she goes, and the other kids in her class are wary of her tendency to succumb to terrified fits of screaming. Believing that a change from her English environment might be the perfect antidote to Jess's alarming mood swings, her parents whisk her off to Nigeria for the first time where she meets her mother's family--including her formidable grandfather. Jess's adjustment to Nigeria is only beginning when she encounters Titiola, or TillyTilly, a ragged little girl her own age. To Jess, it seems that, at last, she has found someone who will understand her. But gradually, TillyTilly's visits become more disturbing, making Jess start to realize that she doesn't know who TillyTilly is at all. Helen Oyeyemi draws on Nigerian mythology to present a strikingly original variation on a classic literary theme: the existence of ""doubles,"" both real and spiritual, who play havoc with our perceptions and our lives. Lyrical, haunting, and compelling, The Icarus Girl is a story of twins and ghosts, of a little girl growing up between cultures and colors.

","The winter of 1947 is about to fall on the Yorkshire Dales. With it comes the gypsy, William Cooper — a dark-haired and dark-eyed twenty-four-year-old, whose sculptured body shames Michelangelo’s David. Although, best with horses, he is a Jack-of-all-trades and is seeking work. A chance meeting with the newlywed Henleys, results in his employment — an encounter that will steer all their paths.From the moment William put on the Italian suit, it set the yearning. One day, he was going to have his own. And here, being part of the Whernside estate, he had a good shot at it. It was just a matter of focusing the master on his worth.Whernside moves through the years of 1947 to 1973. It tells of the lives, loves and losses of those connected to it — four generations — just over a quarter of a century taken from its 400 year history. A history steeped in tales.",,,Kindle Edition,,262 pages,"

","Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00DENSV6U.  Prepare yourself for the one of the most exciting rides of your life.  Volume Two of The King Trilogy, The Tainted Trust is, in addition to a moving and action packed thriller, a brilliant depiction of what perfectly normal people will do for love and money. It is the continuing story of an inconvenient fortune and its catastrophic impact on a loving family.  No one wept when Jim Servito died. He left an estate amounting to $325,000,000 when his wife, Karen killed him in Caracas. He had accumulated the fortune the old fashioned way: he stole it from the U.S. and Canadian Governments using a brilliant gasoline tax evasion scam. The money is hot, deposited in a Cayman Island bank, and its cursed. It has a profound affect on everyone who touched it. It is managed by Alfred Schnieder, an aging and unscrupulous Caracas banker.  Mike King, the love of Karen’s life, and nearly ruined by the Feds’ scorched earth efforts to recover Servito’s fortune, convinces her to keep the money, instead of returning it to its rightful owners. With the assistance of Schnieder, they form The King Trust, a near fatal mistake. Desperate to recover the money, the Feds continue to spare no expense and effort to do so. Phillip, the only child of Karen and Jim Servito, assumes he is the natural heir to his father’s fortune, and has his own greedy plans for the money. Aging Alfred Schnieder relinquishes the trust’s management to Louis Visconti, a thirty-two year old Wall Street whiz kid and brilliant financial engineer. Dubbed ‘The Crown Prince of Wall Street’, and substantially more unscrupulous than Schnieder, Visconti takes The King Trust to bewildering heights, then fails, miserably.  Kerri Pyper, Mike King’s twenty-three year old estranged daughter, has not seen or communicated with her father since she was nine. She discovers the existence of The King Trust and is shocked to learn that her natural father is its Trustee. Visconti, desperate and assuming he is still the smartest man in the room, embezzles the fortune and flees to Monaco. He made only two mistakes: he deceived both Mike King and Alfred Schnieder and fell in love with Kerri.",,,Kindle Edition,ACE,,"

","William Wordsworth (1771-1850) is the foremost of the English Romantic poets. He was much influenced by the events of the French Revolution in his youth, and he deliberately broke away from the artificial diction of the Augustan and neo-classical tradition of the eighteenth century. He sought to write in the language of ordinary men and women, of ordinary thoughts, sights and sounds, and his early poetry represents this fresh approach to his art. Wordsworth spent most of his adult life in the Lake District with his sister Dorothy and his wife Mary, by whom he had four children. His remarkable autobiographical poem The Prelude was completed in 1805, but was not published until after his death, and it is included in this full edition of Wordsworth's poetry.",1853264016,9781853264016),Paperback,,1120 pages,"

","As the 1950s close down, Peanuts definitively enters its golden age. Linus, who had just learned to speak in the previous volume, becomes downright eloquent and even begins to fend off Lucy's bullying; even so, his security neurosis becomes more pronounced, including a harrowing two-week ""Lost Weekend"" sequence of blanketlessness. Charlie Brown cascades further down the hill to loserdom, with spectacularly lost kites, humiliating baseball losses (including one where he becomes ""the Goat"" and is driven from the field in a chorus of BAAAAHs); at least his newly acquired ""pencil pal"" affords him some comfort. Pig-Pen, Shermy, Violet, and Patty are also around, as is an increasingly Beethoven-fixated Schroeder. But the rising star is undoubtedly Snoopy. He's at the center of the most graphically dynamic and action-packed episodes (the ones in which he attempts to grab Linus's blanket at a dead run). He even tentatively tries to sleep on the crest of his doghouse roof once or twice, with mixed results. And his imitations continue apace, including penguins, anteaters, sea monsters, vultures and (much to her chagrin) Lucy. No wonder the beagle is the cover star of this volume.",1560976705,9781560976707),Hardcover,,325 pages,"

","Budd Schulberg's celebrated novel of the prize ring has lost none of its power since its first publication almost fifty years ago. Crowded with unforgettable characters, it is a relentless expose of the fight racket. A modern Samson in the form of a simple Argentine peasant is ballyhooed by an unscrupulous fight promoter and his press agent and then betrayed and destroyed by connivers. Mr. Schulberg creates a wonderfully authentic atmosphere for this book that many critics hailed as even better than What Makes Sammy Run? ""The quintessential novel of boxing and corruption.""--USA Today ""The book will stand not only as the novel about boxing but also as a book that indirectly tells more about civilization than do most books about civilization itself.""--Arthur Miller.

","London, 1894. Juliet Moreau has built a life for herself-working as a maid, attending church on Sundays, and trying not to think about the scandal that ruined her life. After all, no one ever proved the rumours about her father′s gruesome experiments. But when she learns her father is alive and continuing his work on a remote tropical island, she is determined to find out if the accusations were true.Juliet is accompanied by the doctor′s handsome young assistant and an enigmatic castaway, who both attract Juliet for very different reasons. They travel to the island only to discover the depths of her father′s madness: he has created animals that have been vivisected to resemble, speak, and behave as humans. Worse, one of the creatures has turned violent and is killing the island′s inhabitants. Juliet knows she must end her father′s dangerous experiments and escape the island, even though her horror is mixed with her own scientific curiosity. As the island falls into chaos, she discovers the extent of her father′s genius-and madness-in her own blood.",0007500203,9780007500208),Paperback,,360 pages,"

","A powerful, blazingly honest memoir: the story of an eleven-hundred-mile solo hike that broke down a young woman reeling from catastrophe—and built her back up again. At twenty-two, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's death, her family scattered and her own marriage was soon destroyed. Four years later, with nothing more to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to hike the Pacific Crest Trail from the Mojave Desert through California and Oregon to Washington State—and to do it alone. She had no experience as a long-distance hiker, and the trail was little more than “an idea, vague and outlandish and full of promise.” But it was a promise of piecing back together a life that had come undone.  Strayed faces down rattlesnakes and black bears, intense heat and record snowfalls, and both the beauty and loneliness of the trail. Told with great suspense and style, sparkling with warmth and humor, Wild vividly captures the terrors and pleasures of one young woman forging ahead against all odds on a journey that maddened, strengthened, and ultimately healed her.",0307957659,9780307957658),ebook,,336 pages,"

","‘Men and women of Maturai of the four temples! I curse this city. Its king erred in killing the man I loved’One of the world's masterpieces, The Cilappatikaram (5th century ce) by Ilanko Atikal is India's finest epic in a language other than Sanskrit. It spells out in unforgettable verse the problems that humanity has been wrestling with for a long time: love, war, evil, fate and death.The Tale of an Anklet is the love story of Kovalan and Kannaki. Originating in Tamil mythology, the compelling tale of Kannaki—her love, her feats and triumphs, and her ultimate transformation to goddess—follows the conventions of Tamil poetry and is told in three phases: the erotic, the heroic and the mythic. This epic ranks with the Ramayana and the Mahabharata as one of the great classics of Indian literature and is presented for the first time in a landmark English verse translation by the eminent poet R. Parthasarathy, making it accessible to a wider audience.",0143031961,9780143031963),Paperback,,440 pages,"

Maar al direct vanaf het begin heeft ze het gevoel dat deze opdracht een dekmantel is en dat ze met een heel ander doel naar Asher Falls is gelokt. Een gevoel dat wordt versterkt wanneer ze hoort dat er naast het te restaureren kerkhof nog een begraafplaats bestaat - diep verzonken op de bodem van een meer - en Asher Falls zelf zo goed als verlaten blijkt.Dan stuit ze op nog iets vreemds: één enkel graf - midden in een laurierbos en ogenschijnlijk liefdevol onderhouden. Waarom ligt dat daar? Al snel wordt haar duidelijk dat ze het nooit had mogen vinden. Waarom anders heeft ze het gevoel dat er iemand voortdurend op haar loert?

Plus a sneak peek bonus chapter of the upcoming fifth book in the series, Friends With Way Too Many Benefits, releasing on 12/17/2013.   Book 1 - Friends With Partial Benefits  Jillian Grayson is a disillusioned divorcée and best-selling romance novelist who suddenly can't write a chapter without her hunky male heartthrob suffering ED, an STD, or even worse. Brian Nash is a tennis-obsessed college senior who's unlucky in love and the roommate and best friend of Jillian's son, Rob. When Rob brings Brian home for Spring Break, and Brian meets the surprisingly young and tennis passionate Jillian, their shared interest quickly develops into an intense mutual attraction. After nearly giving in to their feelings, they hatch a plan, while under the influence (of something more than just the perfect Miami night), to be Friends With Partial Benefits, complete with rules to define the boundaries. Will the lonely pair continue with this distinctive relationship, actually explore their desires, or discover all of it is a really bad idea?   Book 2 - Friends With Full Benefits  For best-selling romance novelist Jillian Grayson, writer's block is a thing of the past now that her clandestine relationship with her son's best friend, Brian Nash, has lifted her out of a post-divorce funk. The prospect of breaking the news to her son seems daunting, but it's nothing compared to the nightmare of meeting Brian's superstrict, off-the-wall, disapproving parents. After Jillian, Brian and his younger brother Jim, learn an eye-opening secret about the Nash parents they all go scurrying back to Miami where Jillian's best friend Victoria finds Brian's sexy, but innocent college senior brother to be just what the doctor ordered. But when Jim comes on a little too seriously, will Victoria lose interest and return to her life of casual fun or will things get even more complicated?   Book 3 - Friends With More Benefits  As Jillian and Brian's destination wedding date nears, Jillian's just released novel's complicated success threatens to destroy their big day. While Rob's new job grows extraordinarily more mysterious Brian's becomes infinitely more unfulfilling and both struggle to find the answers. Victoria finds it more and more difficult to hide her secrets and when they are finally exposed there is no shortage of collateral damage. When thoughts are revealed will the wedding be ruined, will Jillian's career survive and will everyone forgive Victoria?   Book 4 - Friends With Extra Benefits  Victoria, Jillian, Brian, Jim, Caroline, and Rob are back in book four, the 400-page epic next chapter in the series. Who will prevail in the Brookhart v. Grayson trial? Will Victoria have a boy or a girl, and will she finally find happiness? Will Rob figure out what the hell is going on with his mysterious and unstable boss, and will Brian find a career? Will you be able to get through the steamy chapters without tossing your e-reader to the floor and chasing your partner around the room?   Prequel - Desperate Thoughts  While struggling to move on with her life, a young widow tumbles into a clandestine sexual encounter with a shy college freshman who reminds her all too much of her late husband. Afterward, she's re-awakened sexually and motivated to pursue her desperately unfulfilled desires.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","“Considered one of the most subtle and beautifully written lesbian novels of the century, this 1949 classic returns to print in a Cleis Press edition. Dorothy Strachey’s classic Olivia captures the awakening passions of an English adolescent sent away for a year to a small finishing school outside Paris. The innocent but watchful Olivia develops an infatuation for her headmistress, Mlle. Julie, and through this screen of love observes the tense romance between Mlle. Julie and the other head of the school, Mlle. Cara, in its final months. “Although not strictly autobiographical, Olivia draws on the author’s experiences at finishing schools run by the charismatic Mlle. Marie Souvestre, whose influence lived on through former students like Natalie Barney and Eleanor Roosevelt. Olivia was dedicated to the memory of Strachey’s friend Virginia Woolf and published to acclaim in 1949. Colette wrote the screenplay for the 1951 film adaptation of the novel. In 1999, Olivia was included on the Publishing Triangle’s widely publicized list of the 100 Best Gay and Lesbian Novels of the 20th Century. “Dorothy Strachey (1865-1960) was the sister of the novelist Lytton Strachey and a prominent member of the Bloomsbury Group…….Olivia, originally published under a pseudonym, is her only novel.” -- Amazon.com",1573442429,9781573442428),Paperback,,135 pages,"

","It's 1770, and fourteen-year-old Rachel Marsh is a servant in the Boston household of John Adams. But her loyalty to the Adams family is tested by her friendship with Matthew Kilroy, a British private with an unsavory reputation. Rachel knows Matthew is frustrated and angry, but even she is surprised when he is accused of joining soldiers in firing upon a mob of citizens . . . in the bloody encounter that came to be known as the Boston Massacre. “Carefully researched and lovingly written, Rinaldi’s latest presents a girl indentured to John and Abigail Adams during the tense period surrounding the 1770 Massacre. . . . Fortuitously timed, a novel that illuminates a moment from our past that has strong parallels to recent events. Bibliography.”--Kirkus Reviews",,,Kindle Edition,,354 pages,"

",Publio Cornelio Escipión. que pasaría a la historia con el sobrenombre de Africanus. sólo tenía 26 años cuando aceptó comandar las tropas romanas en Hispania. Poseedor de las cualidades militares de su padre y su tío. el joven Escipión también heredó a algunos de los feroces enemigos de éstos. como Asdrúbal. el hermano de Aníbal. o el general pánico Ciscón. quienes planeaban derrotar a su ejército en el campo de batalla. Sus opositores también le acechaban en el mismísimo Senado de Roma. donde el todopoderoso Quinto Fabio Máximo. detractor de la familia de los Escipiones desde tiempo atrás. logró forzarle. una vez concluida la campaña en Hispania. al aceptar la demencial tarea de liderar las legiones V y VI que permanecían desde hacía tiempo olvidadas en Sicilia. Estas eran unas legiones malditas. constituidas por los soldados supervivientes a Cannae. la más humillante derrota de Roma ante Aníbal. En el exilio. las legiones habían perdido el sentido del deber. la disciplina y toda esperanza de regresar a la patria. Con esta maniobra. Quinto Fabio Máximo creía abocar al último Escipión de la estirpe a una muerte segura. Lo que Fabio Máximo no podía prever era que el joven Escipión y sus legiones malditas estaban llamados a cambiar el curso de la historia.En un fascinante relato que recrea no solamente un momento decisivo de la expansión del imperio. sino también la vida cotidiana en el esplendoroso mundo de la antigua Roma. Santiago Posteguillo hace al lector cómplice y testigo de las batallas. conquistas y derrotas de Africanus y sus ejércitos. Las legiones malditas es una trepidante novela sobre la guerra. el amor. la envidia. la amistad y la supervivencia.,,,Kindle Edition,,864 pages,"

","Two roads. One choice. Anabella Anthony found she was alone in the world at eighteen. Early on, she made a choice; to live an ordinary life away from the lifestyle her parents preferred. However, they had plans for her; they wanted her to become a part of their choices. All she wanted was a regular household, with normal day to day issues like her peers, parents she could respect, and who above anything else would accept her for the person she is. Torn between dreams that filled her mind with alluring effects and uncomfortable events which tried to sway her, she had to come to a resolution―find peace and stay true to her convictions. Through it all, she excelled in her sport; a dedicated student who falls in love with a much older man. Will she give in to her body's desires, or will she remain steadfast in her own choices? Can she find the courage to stand amidst the turmoil wanting to drag her down? And most importantly, will she ever forgive those who meant to harm her? Aldrich Hagin―a lawyer―is ready to settle down. After a tragic loss he experienced right after university he is now, more than ever, ready to move on and start a family. And then he meets a young, energetic, lively woman who turns his life and heart around. Will he be willing to sacrifice his own desires and wait? Can he help her and be the anchor she so desperately needs? Confronted with his own decisions, the choice is his as to whether he’ll stay or leave. What will he decide? A love story filled with decisions both have to make; to stand against all odds and remain true to oneself.",9780620588,9780620588,Kindle Edition,First Edition,313 pages,"

","He is the deadliest American sniper ever, called “the devil” by theenemies he hunted and “the legend” by his Navy SEAL brothers . ..From 1999 to 2009, U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle recorded the most careersniper kills in United States military history. The Pentagon hasofficially confirmed more than 150 of Kyles kills (the previousAmerican record was 109), but it has declined to verify theastonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyleso much they named him al-Shaitan (“the devil”) and placed a bountyon his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs,Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadlyaccuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping andunforgettable, Kyle’s masterful account of his extraordinarybattlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of alltime. A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting tripswith his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior tojoining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines ofthe War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniperwho performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavyfire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, hestared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talkshonestly about the pain of war—of twice being shot and experiencingthe tragic deaths of two close friends. American Sniper also honorsKyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield.And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya,speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage andchildren, as well as on Chris. Adrenaline-charged and deeplypersonal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of warthat only one man could tell.",0062082353,9780062082350),Hardcover,,381 pages,"

The post 9/11 global economy is a new and turbulent system - vastly more flexible, resilient, open, self-directing, and fast-changing than it was even twenty years ago. The Age of Turbulence is an incomparable reckoning with the nature of this new world - how we got here, what we're living through, and what lies over the horizon, for good or ill, channelled through Greenspan's own experiences working in the command room of the global economy for longer and with greater effect than any other single living figure.",0713999829,9780713999822),Hardcover,,575 pages,"

","The dazzling conclusion to Marianne de Pierres' critically acclaimed space opera sequence.Mira Fedor and her friends stand in the eye of the hurricane. Everything is in flux and nothing is as it appears to be. Mira's pregnancy seems to be proceeding at an inhuman pace and the sedate acceptance of this state of affairs by her biozoon, Insigna, is as much an irritation as it is comfort. It seems clear that the extropists' procedures have had an unforeseen effect - but will her child be more than human? Or less?Meanwhile, the galaxy-wide conspiracy that has plagued the Orion League for so long is blown wide open. The conspirators stand unmasked, but is there time to prevent their carefully laid plans coming to fruition? And even if there is, how many of the Orion Worlds will pay the price for their leaders’ blindness?The pieces are all in play; all that remains is for each side to commit to its end game. But there’s one question nobody has thought to ask: will god play by the rules . . .?",1841497592,9781841497594),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Even in the darkest of times—especially in the darkest of times—there is room for strength and bravery. A remarkable memoir from Leon Leyson, one of the youngest children to survive the Holocaust on Oskar Schindler’s list.Leon Leyson (born Leib Lezjon) was only ten years old when the Nazis invaded Poland and his family was forced to relocate to the Krakow ghetto. With incredible luck, perseverance, and grit, Leyson was able to survive the sadism of the Nazis, including that of the demonic Amon Goeth, commandant of Plaszow, the concentration camp outside Krakow. Ultimately, it was the generosity and cunning of one man, a man named Oskar Schindler, who saved Leon Leyson’s life, and the lives of his mother, his father, and two of his four siblings, by adding their names to his list of workers in his factory—a list that became world renowned: Schindler’s List.This, the only memoir published by a former Schindler’s List child, perfectly captures the innocence of a small boy who goes through the unthinkable. Most notable is the lack of rancor, the lack of venom, and the abundance of dignity in Mr. Leyson’s telling. The Boy on the Wooden Box is a legacy of hope, a memoir unlike anything you’ve ever read.",1442497831,9781442497832),ebook,,240 pages,"

Rye Clanton  I told myself a long time ago that I wouldn’t—couldn’t—fall in love. I’ve seen what happens, the things they don’t tell you in fairytales.

However, he’s a walking contradiction that I can’t figure out, an enigma that has stumped me more times than I can count. But he’s the first person that’s ever made me feel alive—free.

","Bee is an orphan who lives with a carnival and sleeps in the back of a tractor trailer. Every day she endures taunts for the birthmark on her face—though her beloved Pauline, the only person who has ever cared for her, tells her it is a precious diamond. When Pauline is sent to work for another carnival, Bee is lost.Then a scruffy dog shows up, as unwanted as she, and Bee realizes that she must find a home for them both. She runs off to a house with gingerbread trim that reminds her of frosting. There two mysterious women, Mrs. Swift and Mrs. Potter, take her in. They clothe her, though their clothes are strangely out of date. They feed her, though there is nothing in their house to eat. They help her go to school, though they won't enter the building themselves. And, strangely, only Bee seems able to see them.Whoever these women are, they matter. They matter to Bee. And they are helping Bee realize that she, too, matters to the world--if only she will let herself be a part of it.This tender novel beautifully captures the pain of isolation, the healing power of community, and the strength of the human spirit.",0375868364,9780375868368),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

AND the long anticipated final book, The Courts of Chaos - in a handsome two volume set.Amber is the one real world, casting infinite reflections of itself - Shadow worlds that can be manipulated by those of royal Amberite blood. Unfortunately, the royal family is torn by jealousies and suspicions. And the disappearance of the clan patriarch, Oberon, has intensified the conflicts by leaving Amber's throne apparently up for grabs.The CHRONICLES begin in a hospital on the Shadow Earth, where a man is recovering from a freak auto accident. Since he is also suffering from amnesia, and has been for some time, he has no idea that he's Prince Corwin of Amber - until his memory receives a succession of jolts:He meets a sister who speaks in riddles of plots and counterplots... and a brother who abruptly involves him in a life-and-death battle against pursuers from a fearful Shadow world.He discovers a deck of tarot-like cards, with himself, his sister, and strangers whom he guesses to be other relatives, pictured on their faces. Only lingering amnesia keeps him from grasping the full significance of the find: the cards are the Greater Trumps of Amber, used by his family to communicate across vast distances, and transport one another through Shadows in an instant.Then comes the most shattering jolt of all... Corwin's confrontation with an intricate design created by a master manipulator of reality - the Pattern. By walking the Pattern, those of the blood royal gain the ability to control Shadows. But the slightest hesitation or misstep during the trial means death.As Corwin sets foot upon that coldly glowing inscription, memories come flooding back to him... more and more with each step. And finally, knowing his true identity, he acknowledges his true ambition - and resolves that the crown of Amber will be his.But unknown to Corwin, there are dark forces massing against Amber... and before too long he will discover just how great a burden a king's crown can be...",,,Hardcover,Book Club Edition (SFBC),338 pages,"

","The story of the relationship between Abélard and Héloïse is one of the world’s most celebrated and tragic love affairs. It is told through the letters of Peter Abélard, a French philosopher and one of the greatest logicians of the twelfth century, and of his gifted pupil Héloïse. Through their impassioned writings unfolds the story of a romance, from its reckless, ecstatic beginnings through to public scandal, an enforced secret marriage and its devastating consequences. These eloquent and intimate letters express a vast range of emotions from adoration and devotion to reproach, indignation and grief, and offer a fascinating insight into religious life in the Middle Ages.This is the revised edition of Betty Radice's highly regarded translation, in which Michael Clanchy, the biographer of Abélard, updates the scholarship on the letters and the lovers. This volume includes Abélard's remarkable autobiography and his spiritual advice to Héloïse and her nuns, as well as a selection of the 'lost love letters' of Abélard and Héloïse, letters between Héloïse and Peter the Venerable, two of Abélard's hymns, a chronology, notes and maps.",0140448993,9780140448993),Paperback,Revised Edition,383 pages,"

","Everyone wanted to believe that endless love was possible. She'd believed in it once, too, back when she was eighteen.In the spring of 1984, high school students Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole fell deeply, irrevocably in love. Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.Now, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance. Neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever changed their lives. As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed. Forced to confront painful memories, the two former lovers will discover undeniable truths about the choices they have made. And in the course of a single, searing weekend, they will ask of the living, and the dead: Can love truly rewrite the past?",1455556556,9781455556557),Paperback,Movie Tie-In,336 pages,"

","The latest installment of the New York Times bestselling Spellman mysteries, finds private investigator Izzy Spellman on the verge of losing everything.Isabel Spellman is used to being followed, extorted, and questioned—all occupational hazards of working at her family’s firm, Spellman Investigations. Her little sister, Rae, once tailed Izzy for weeks on end to discover the identity of her boyfriend. Her mother, Olivia, once blackmailed Izzy with photographic evidence of Prom Night 1994. It seemed that the Spellmans would lay off after Izzy was fired for breaching client confidentiality, but then Izzy avenged her dismissal by staging a hostile takeover of the company. She should have known better than to think she could put such shenanigans behind her.In The Last Word, Izzy’s troubles are just beginning. After her hostile takeover of Spellman Investigations, Izzy’s parents simply go on strike. Her sister, Rae, comes back into the family business with questionable motivations. Her other employees seem to be coping with anxiety disorders, and she has no idea how to pay the bills. However, her worst threat comes from someone who is no relation. Within months of assuming control of the business, Izzy is accused of embezzling from a former client, the ridiculously wealthy Mr. Slayter, who happens to have Alzheimer’s, which Izzy and he are diligently trying to keep under wraps. Not only is Slayter’s business and reputation on the line, but if Izzy gets indicted for embezzlement, she’ll lose everything—her business, her license, and her family’s livelihood. Is this the end of Izzy Spellman, PI? The answer makes The Last Word, hands down, the most thrilling book in this bestselling, award-nominated series.",1451686684,9781451686685),ebook,,352 pages,"

Nimira is a foreign music-hall girl forced to dance for mere pennies. When wealthy sorcerer Hollin Parry hires her to sing with a piano-playing automaton, Nimira believes it is the start of a new and better life. In Parry's world, however, buried secrets are beginning to stir. Unsettling below-stairs rumors swirl about ghosts, a madwoman roaming the halls, and Parry's involvement with a league of sorcerers who torture fairies for sport. Then Nimira discovers the spirit of a fairy gentleman named Erris is trapped inside the clockwork automaton, waiting for someone to break his curse. The two fall into a love that seems hopeless, and breaking the curse becomes a race against time, as not just their love, but the fate of the entire magical world may be in peril.

","She is young and beautiful, and recently married to a very wealthy middle-aged man who considers her to be the ultimate woman for him and holds her out as a model for his beloved 10-year-old daughter. They travel to a mountain hideaway to celebrate their first year together as a family when things begin to unravel. Her husband goes missing after a treacherous car accident, and the wife and daughter seem trapped and isolated, and stalked from both inside and outside the cabin. What ensues is the story of a woman driven by her soulless greed and self entitlement, and a man who is wronged and apparently out to get revenge. This deadly game of cat and mouse will keep you on the edge of your seat. The macabre scenes include deadly traps and medieval torture devices, hidden doors, secret rooms, and an underground labyrinth of torture chambers. Add in the legend of a hoard of pure gold bars, and it becomes clear that someone has a much bigger plan in mind and will let nothing get in their way. But who? This is the story of a plot so devious that it is set up to fool the State police investigation. But can it fool you? Keep guessing until the final scene as to what is really going on and let your intuition guide you.",,,Kindle Edition,,186 pages,"

","In Seth Godin’s most inspiring book yet, he challenges readers to find the courage to treat their work as a form of art. Everyone knows that Icarus’s father made him wings and told him not to fly too close to the sun. But he ignored that warning and plunged to his doom. We’ve retold this myth, and many others like it, to generations of kids. All these stories have the same lesson: Play it safe. Obey your parents. Listen to the experts. It was the perfect propaganda for the industrial economy. What boss wouldn’t want employees to believe that obedience and conformity are the keys to success? But there’s another part of the myth that those in power hope you’ll forget. Icarus was also warned not to fly too low, because sea water would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too high, because it feels deceptively safe.The safety zone has moved. The propaganda has been exposed, and the old promises have been broken: Conformity no longer leads to comfort. But the good news is that creativity is scarce, and more valuable than ever. So is choosing to do something unpredictable and brave: make art.Being an artist isn’t a genetic disposition or a specific talent. It’s an attitude we can all adopt. It’s a hunger to seize new ground, make connections, and work without a map. If you do those things you’re an artist, no matter what it says on your business card.Whether you’re a teacher, engineer, doctor, middle manager, or customer service rep, you can fly higher by bringing your best self to work. You can care about what you’re doing today and how you can improve tomorrow. Godin shows us how it’s possible, and convinces us why it’s essential.",1591846072,9781591846079),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","""Penyebaran Islam merupakan salah satu proses yang sangat penting dalam sejarah Indonesia, tapi juga yang paling tidak jelas."" ""Dengan dipilihnya SBY oleh rakyat Indonesia secara langsung dan dengan dukungan yang sekuat itu, maka pada tanggal 20 Oktober 2004 SBY dilantik sebagai Presiden Indonesia ke-6 dengan amanat rakyat yang paling kuat sepanjang sejarah Indonesia merdeka.""Dengan kalimat pertama, M.C. Ricklefs membuka buku ini. Dengan kalimat kedua, ia mengakhiri cerita panjangnya. Bermula pada tahun 1211, berakhir pada 2004. Dimulai dengan kedatangan Islam, diakhiri dengan terpilihnya Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono sebagai presiden. Masuknya Islam di bumi Nusantara mengawali suatu rentangan waktu yang disebut Ricklefs sebagai Indonesia Modern. Ia mengajukan tiga unsur fundamental yang, menurutnya, telah mempersatukan periode tersebut sebagai ""sebuah unit sejarah yang padu"". Yang pertama adalah unsur kebudayaan dan agama: islamisasi Indonesia yang dimulai tahun Â± 1200 dan berlanjut hingga hari ini. Yang kedua adalah unsur topik: saling pengaruh antara orang Indonesia dan orang Barat yang dimulai tahun Â± 1500 dan masih berlanjut. Yang ketiga adalah historiografi: sumber-sumber primer sepanjang periode ini ditulis hampir secara eksklusif dalam bahasa-bahasa Indonesia modern (Jawa, Melayu, dan seterusnya, bukannya Jawa Kuno atau Melayu Kuno) dan dalam bahasa-bahasa Eropa. Dengan mendasarkan penelitiannya pada puluhan jurnal dan lebih dari lima ratus buku, Ricklefs mengisahkan perjalanan bangsa Indonesia dari zaman ke zaman yang penuh warna, lengkap dengan aneka persoalan dan pertikaian internal maupun eksternalnhya. Di balik stuktur narasinya, buku ini menjawab pertanyaan tentang bagaimana komunitas-komunitas dari berbagai kepulauan Indonesia, dengan rupa-rupa etnis dan bahasa dan tersebar ke dalam negara-negara kerajaan yang terpisah-pisah, bisa bersatu menjadi sebuah bangsa modern. Terbit pertama kali lebih dari 20 tahun yang lalu, versi asli (bahasa Inggris) buku ini telah mengalami beberapa kali update. Versi Indonesia di tangan Anda ini merupakan terjemahan dari edisi terakhirnya yang terbit tahun 2001, ditambah satu bab baru yang khusus ditulis pengarangnya untuk versi Indonesia, mendiskusikan periode paling mutakhir dalam sejarah Indonesia, 2001-2004.",9791600120,9791600120,Hardcover,,784 pages,"

After all, Trey—who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack—can’t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks.Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey’s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him.

","Xavier makes a lot of people nervous. The rest, he flat-out scares. More than his hulking, tattooed body, it's his predator's gaze that makes people feel vulnerable, as if he had the power to read their thoughts and see their soul. For his lovers, it's Xavier's ravenous appetite for all things carnal—for the taste of flesh under his tongue and the feel of a trembling body under his control, for whispered pleas and muffled cries—that makes him dangerous.But recently, driven by a festering rage against the men who attacked his sister a decade ago, Xavier has developed a taste for a different kind of hunt and conquest: stalking men who do truly bad things and punishing the predators he sniffs out. The problem with vigilante justice, though, is sometimes the man in your trap is innocent.Carson suspects he's playing a risky game with dangerous men. But the lies are convincing, especially when they're slipped to him among hundred dollar bills. He never guessed how big and dark the secret hidden under all the lies and money could be. And he has no idea he's not the predator, but the prey, until it's too late.And you can't beg for mercy when there's a gag in your mouth.But when Carson escapes from Xavier's trap, he's forced to accept that Xavier is far from his most dangerous enemy. Xavier may even hold the key to overcoming the painful past that has kept Carson prisoner for almost two decades.",,,ebook,,410 pages,"

","Since his first appearance in Beeton’s Christmas Annual in 1887, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes has been one of the most beloved fictional characters ever created. Now, in one eBook, Bantam Classics presents all fifty-six short stories and four novels featuring Conan Doyle’s classic hero—a truly complete collection of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures in crime!Volume I includes the early novel A Study in Scarlet, which introduced the eccentric genius of Sherlock Holmes to the world. This baffling murder mystery, with the cryptic word Rache written in blood, first brought Holmes together with Dr. John Watson. Next, The Sign of Four presents Holmes’s famous “seven percent solution” and the strange puzzle of Mary Morstan in the quintessential locked-room mystery. Also included are Holmes’s feats of extraordinary deception in such famous cases as the chilling “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” the baffling riddle of “The Musgrave Ritual,” and the ingeniously plotted “The Five Orange Pips.” Volume II begins with The Hound of Baskervilles, a haunting novel of murder on eerie Grimpen Moor, which has rightly earned its reputation as the finest murder mystery ever written. The Valley of Fear matches Holmes against his archenemy, the master of imaginative crime, Professor Moriarty. In addition, the loyal Dr. Watson has faithfully recorded Holmes’s feats of extraordinary detection in such famous cases as the thrilling “The Adventure of the Red Circle,” Holmes’s tragic and fortunately premature farewell in “The Final Problem,” and the twelve baffling adventures from The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle’s incomparable tales bring to life a Victorian England of horse-drawn cabs, fogs, and the famous lodgings at 221 B Baker Street, where for more than forty years Sherlock Holmes earned his undisputed reputation as the greatest fictional detective of all time.",,,Kindle Edition,,1796 pages,"

","Ghosts is the story of Helen Alving, a widow who is haunted by the many mistresses of her deceased husband and by her son who has inherited syphilis from his philandering father. Ghosts is a scathing indictment of Victorian society in which Ibsen refutes the notion that if one simply fulfills one's duty rather than following one's desires then a good and noble life will be achieved. Scandalous in its day for its frank discussion of venereal disease and marriage infidelity, Ghosts remains to this day an intense psychological drama and sharp social criticism.Ghosts was written during the autumn of 1881 and was published in December of the same year. It was not performed in the theatre until May 1882, when a Danish touring company produced it in the Aurora Turner Hall in Chicago. Ibsen disliked the translator William Archer's use of the word 'Ghosts' as the play's title, whereas the Norwegian Gengangere would be more accurately translated as The Revenants, which literally means The Ones who Return.",1420927957,9781420927955),Paperback,,48 pages,"

","Coco Pinchard always dreamed of being a successful writer, but then life got in the way. She married young, had a son, and put her dreams on hold. But now she's 40, and her first novel is about to be published! Her husband Daniel has greyed nicely into a silver fox, and her son Rosencrantz is all grown up. Shouldn't it be time to enjoy life?That is, until the annual family Christmas when her hideous in-laws come to stay, and Coco opens her gift from Daniel. It's not the jewelry she chose, but an iPhone. This marks the start of Daniel's mid-life crisis and Coco catches him in bed with a younger woman.The iPhone becomes a confessional, and as Coco's life unravels, she documents her seemingly endless (and often entertaining) run of bad luck through emails to loyal friends Christopher, an ageing trustafarian, and Marika, a slightly alcoholic schoolteacher.Then Coco meets the hunky Adam and she's back in the world of dating as a single 40-something. Listen to the heart warming and often hilarious tale of Coco picking up the pieces, in this fun, feel-good romantic comedy.",1490380922,9781490380926),Paperback,2nd,302 pages,"

","A haunting memoir of teaching English to the sons of North Korea's ruling class during the last six months of Kim Jong-il's reignEvery day, three times a day, the students march in two straight lines, singing praises to Kim Jong-il and North Korea: Without you, there is no motherland. Without you, there is no us. It is a chilling scene, but gradually Suki Kim, too, learns the tune and, without noticing, begins to hum it. It is 2011, and all universities in North Korea have been shut down for an entire year, the students sent to construction fields - except for the 270 students at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), a walled compound where portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il look on impassively from the walls of every room, and where Suki has accepted a job teaching English. Over the next six months, she will eat three meals a day with her young charges and struggle to teach them to write, all under the watchful eye of the regime. Life at PUST is lonely and claustrophobic, especially for Suki, whose letters are read by censors and who must hide her notes and photographs not only from her minders but from her colleagues - evangelical Christian missionaries who don't know or choose to ignore that Suki doesn't share their faith. She is mystified by how easily her students lie, unnerved by their obedience to the regime. To them, everything in North Korea is the best, the tallest, the most delicious, the envy of all nations. Still, she cannot help but love them - their boyish enthusiasm, their eagerness to please, the flashes of curiosity that have not yet been extinguished. As the weeks pass, she begins to hint at the existence of a world beyond their own - at such exotic activities as surfing the Internet or traveling freely and, more dangerously, at electoral democracy and other ideas forbidden in a country where defectors risk torture and execution. The students in turn offer Suki tantalizing glimpses into their lives, from their thoughts on how to impress girls to their disappointment that soccer games are only televised when the North Korean team wins. Then Kim Jong-il dies, leaving the students devastated, and leading Suki to question whether the gulf between her world and theirs can ever be bridged.Without You, There Is No Us offers a moving and incalculably rare glimpse of life in the world's most unknowable country, and at the privileged young men she calls ""soldiers and slaves.""",0307720659,9780307720658),Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","Zhou Enlai, the premier of the People's Republic of China from 1949 until his death in 1976, is the last Communist political leader to be revered by the Chinese people. He is considered ""a modern saint"" who offered protection to his people during the Cultural Revolution; an admirable figure in an otherwise traumatic and bloody era. Works about Zhou in China are heavily censored, and every hint of criticism is removed—so when Gao Wenqian first published this groundbreaking, provocative biography in Hong Kong, it was immediately banned in the People's Republic. Using classified documents spirited out of China, Gao Wenqian offers an objective human portrait of the real Zhou, a man who lived his life at the heart of Chinese politics for fifty years, who survived both the Long March and the Cultural Revolution not thanks to ideological or personal purity, but because he was artful, crafty, and politically supple. He may have had the looks of a matinee idol, and Nixon may have called him ""the greatest statesman of our era,"" but Zhou's greatest gift was to survive, at almost any price, thanks to his acute understanding of where political power resided at any one time.",158648415X,9781586484156),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","In the course of making nearly 400 films over the past 50 years, ""Stan Brakhage"" became synonymous with independent American filmmaking, particularly its avant-garde component. This major collection of writings draws primarily upon two long out-of-print books--Metaphors on Vision and Brakhage Scrapbook. Brakhage examines filmmaking in relation to social and professional contexts, the nature of influence and collaboration, the aesthetics of personal experience, and the conditions under which various films were made. Brakhage discusses his predecessors and contemporaries, relates film to dance and poetry, and in ""A Moving Picture Giving and Taking Book"" provides a manual for the novice filmmaker. Lectures, interviews, essays, and manifestos document Brakhage's personal vision and public persona.",092970164X,9780929701646),Paperback,,232 pages,"

","In I Love Dick, Chris Kraus, author of Aliens & Anorexia, Torpor, and Video Green, boldly tears away the veil that separates fiction from reality and privacy from self-expression. It's no wonder that upon its publication in 1997, I Love Dick instantly elicited violent controversies and attracted a host of passionate admirers. The story is gripping enough: in 1994 a married failed independent filmmaker who is about to turn forty falls in love with a well-known art and culture theorist named Dick and endeavors to seduce him with the help of her husband, a defiantly unconventional French academic with whom she hasn't had sex in a very long time.But when the theorist refuses to answer her letters, husband and wife continue the correspondence for each other instead, imagining the fling the wife wishes to have with Dick. What follows is a breathless pursuit that takes the woman across America and away from her husband and far beyond her original infatuation into a discovery of the transformative power of first-person narrative. I Love Dick is a manifesto for a new kind of feminist who isn't afraid to burn through her own narcissism in order to assume responsibility for herself and for the injustice in the world, and it's a book you won't put down until the author's final, heroic acts of self-revelation and transformation.",1584350342,9781584350347),Paperback,,277 pages,"

I stared up into those stormy eyes and braced myself. He was about to wreck me again.""I know we haven't known each other long, but seriously, Chase, there's so much more to you than this,"" he said waving his hands around my room and gritting his teeth out of anger.I don't know if it was the repressed thought of this being the last time I would see him or touch him suddenly surfacing, or the way he was already fighting for me, a girl he barely knew, but something inside of me broke. The innocent nature of my feelings towards him crumbled. My hesitation melted away as I stepped closer and with both hands I grabbed onto his shirt.

","A freshly observed, joyful and wrenching, funny and true new novel from Anne Tyler""It was a beautiful, breezy, yellow-and-green afternoon."" This is how Abby Whitshank always begins the story of how she fell in love with Red that day in July 1959. The Whitshanks are one of those families that radiate togetherness: an indefinable, enviable kind of specialness. But they are also like all families, in that the stories they tell themselves reveal only part of the picture. Abby and Red and their four grown children have accumulated not only tender moments, laughter, and celebrations, but also jealousies, disappointments, and carefully guarded secrets. from Red's father and mother, newly-arrived in Baltimore in the 1920s, to Abby and Red's grandchildren carrying the family legacy boisterously into the twenty-first century, here are four generations of Whitshanks, their lives unfolding in and around the sprawling, lovingly worn Baltimore house that has always been their anchor.Brimming with all the insight, humour, and generosity of spirit that are the hallmarks of Anne Tyler's work, A Spool of Blue Thread tells a poignant yet unsentimental story in praise of family in all its emotional complexity. It is a novel to cherish.",0385683421,9780385683425),Hardcover,,358 pages,"

","WINNER 2013 – National Book Critics Circle Award for FictionFINALIST 2014 – Baileys Women’s Prize for FictionFINALIST 2014 – Andrew Carnegie Medal for FictionLONGLISTED 2015  – International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award A searing new novel, at once sweeping and intimate, by the award-winning author of Half of a Yellow Sun: a story of love and race centered around a man and woman from Nigeria who seemed destined to be together--until the choices they are forced to make tear them apart. Ifemelu--beautiful, self-assured--left Nigeria 15 years ago, and now studies in Princeton as a Graduate Fellow. She seems to have fulfilled every immigrant's dream: Ivy League education; success as a writer of a wildly popular political blog; money for the things she needs. But what came before is more like a nightmare: wrenching departure from family; humiliating jobs under a false name. She feels for the first time the weight of something she didn't think about back home: race.Obinze--handsome and kind-hearted--was Ifemelu's teenage love; he'd hoped to join her in America, but post 9/11 America wouldn't let him in. Obinze's journey leads him to back alleys of illegal employment in London; to a fake marriage for the sake of a work card, and finally, to a set of handcuffs as he is exposed and deported. Years later, when they reunite in Nigeria, neither is the same person who left home. Obinze is the kind of successful ""Big Man"" he'd scorned in his youth, and Ifemelu has become an ""Americanah""--a different version of her former self, one with a new accent and attitude. As they revisit their shared passion--for their homeland and for each other--they must face the largest challenges of their lives. Spanning three continents, entering the lives of a richly drawn cast of characters across numerous divides, Americanah is a riveting story of love and expectation set in today's globalized world.",0307397912,9780307397911),Hardcover,A Borzoi Book,496 pages,"

","On a foggy Monday in 1986, the universe suddenly, without warning, bifurcated. Fast forward to thirty-five years later: Felix Sayers is a culinary writer living in San Francisco of Universe A who spends his days lunching at Coconut Café and dreaming of penning an Agatha Christie-style mystery. But everything changes when his Aunt Henrietta dies, leaving Felix a photograph of his father and himself—dated ten days before Felix was born. It can only mean one thing: Felix has an “alter” in Universe B. Panicked that his mystery novel may have been written already, Felix crosses to San Francisco B and proceeds to flagrantly violate the rules of both worlds by snooping around his alter’s life. But when he narrowly escapes a hit-and-run, it becomes clear that someone knows he’s crossed over…and whoever it is isn’t happy about it. Now Felix must uncover the truth about his alter, the events of one Monday, and a wayward rubber duck before his time in both worlds runs out.""Weaving together physics, philosophy, and wry humor, Maslakovic's inventive debut is a delight."" - Booklist""The story unfolds at a sprightly pace...clever combination of mystery, science fiction and humor gives this title broad appeal.""  - School Library Journal""A witty and light ‘what if’ novel stuffed with an amusing and eclectic cast of characters.” - Publishers Weekly ""Highly recommended."" - Midwest Book Review",1935597345,9781935597346),Paperback,,344 pages,"

","En el dia  a dia d’una parella es barregen els bons i els mals dies, els caràcters amb humors negres, malenconiosos i introvertits (ell), amb els argentats, radiants i vitalistes (ella). Cadascun amb els seus capricis, els seus desigs, les seves inseguretats. La convivència quotidiana, doncs, no és un camí de roses. I encara menys quan es tracta d’una parella jove que està aprenent que les famílies, com les persones, també pateixen la solitud.Afortunadament la jove família protagonista de Negre i plata –el narrador, la seva dona i el fill– compta amb la senyora A –68 anys, vídua sense fills– que entra en les seves vides per fer-se càrrec de les tasques de la casa i aviat es converteix en el centre d’equilibri del nucli familiar. La seva influència benigna, el seu silenciós tutelatge, els ajuda a afrontar l’inevitable del dia a dia i evita que el seu amor es confongui en un malentès.  La notícia que la senyora A. pateix una malaltia greu, però, ho trasbalsa tot.
Com ja va fer  a La solitud dels nombres primers, Paolo Giordano es torna a centrar en les emocions i els sentiments que ens configuren. En aquest cas, a través de la història íntima d’una família jove, en construcció, que ha d’afrontar un nou aprenentatge sentimental.

Suffering horrible pain and many other strange symptoms, Soleilmavis Liu, one of many private citizens, discovered that she and many other people were test-subject victims for the study of electromagnetic spectrums mind control weapons and global surveillance equipment. This book tells the true story that during her horrible period in the grave, her soul was waylaid, but God answered her cries, and gave her love and support. Losing her life to find God was a true consolation and brought joy to her soul and gave her the strength to be a soldier rather than a victim. She worked hard to seek justice by exposing these horrible crimes to the public, which - if not exposed and publicized - in the future humanity would no longer know the meaning of physical inviolability and privacy.

Why you keep coming back for more from hurtful family members, friends, or significant others? Why you keep falling into the same detrimental habits or limiting attitudes--even when you know that they are going to make you feel bad?Dr. Joe Dispenza has spent decades studying the human mind--how it works, how it stores information, and why it perpetuates the same behavioral patterns over and over. In the acclaimed film What the Bleep Do We Know!? he began to explain how the brain evolves--by learning new skills, developing the ability to concentrate in the midst of chaos, and even healing the body and the psyche.Evolve Your Brain presents this information in depth, while helping you take control of your mind, explaining how thoughts can create chemical reactions that keep you addicted to patterns and feelings--including ones that make you unhappy. And when you know how these bad habits are created, it's possible to not only break these patterns, but also reprogram and evolve your brain, so that new, positive, and beneficial habits can take over.This is something you can start to do right now.

","For the Wittgenstein family, the summer of 1915 was a time of both prosperity and unease, as the guns of war sound in the distance. But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer awakening. By glimmering Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. As the two built a new life together, Beata's past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler's terror threatens her life and family--even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced in hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance. Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother's loving strength--and that of her mother's mother before her--as the voices of lost loved once echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations... and between her lost family and her dreams for the future--a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past.",0385336349,9780385336345),Hardcover,,324 pages,"

Trapped by her own hand in an abusive marriage, Victoria allows the darkness to give her comfort in her despair. She travels back to Carson, and we catch up with some of our favorite characters: Big Mama Chandra, Grandpa Ed, and her aunts, Charlotte and Mary. Temptation rears its head in the form of a lost love, but a heartbreaking loss gives Victoria the strength to finally face her parents, Clyde and Tess. Victoria begins to question Mary’s visions that her child will break the line, and she becomes depressed when no such child appears. Frustrated and discouraged, Victoria finds a light in the darkness. However, has she missed her chance to “break the line”, or will she finally be able to make the right choice to find her joy?",,,ebook,,,"

","Fisher,I guess this is it, huh? After fourteen years together, starting a life of our own on this island, five deployments and countless letters I’ve written you through it all, I finally go out to the mailbox and see something I’ve always dreamed of: an envelope with your handwriting on it. For one moment, I actually thought you’d changed your mind, that all the awful things you said to me were just your way of coping after everything you’d been through. I was still here, Fisher. I was still here, holding my breath, waiting for you to come back even though you told me you never would. You always said you’d find your way back to me. Out of all the lies you’ve told me, this one hurts the most. Enclosed you will find the signed divorce papers, as requested. I hope you find what you’re looking for. I’m sorry it wasn’t me. LucyTo get the ending they want, Lucy and Fisher will have to go back to the beginning. Through the good and the bad, they’ll be reminded of why they always made their way back to each other, and why this time, one way or another, it will be the last time.",,,,,400 pages,"

But now she's 40, and her first novel is about to be published! Her husband Daniel has greyed nicely into a silver fox, and her son Rosencrantz is all grown up. Shouldn't it be time to enjoy life?That is, until the annual family Christmas when her hideous in-laws come to stay, and Coco opens her gift from Daniel. It's not the jewelry she chose, but an iPhone. This marks the start of Daniel's mid-life crisis and Coco catches him in bed with a younger woman.The iPhone becomes a confessional, and as Coco's life unravels, she documents her seemingly endless (and often entertaining) run of bad luck through emails to loyal friends Christopher, an ageing trustafarian, and Marika, a slightly alcoholic schoolteacher.Then Coco meets the hunky Adam and she's back in the world of dating as a single 40-something.

Nele, Caco Barcellos, um dos mais prestigiados jornalistas brasileiros, denuncia a atuação irregular da Ronda Ostensiva Tobias de Aguiar (Rota) como um verdadeiro aparelho estatal de extermínio. Um esquadrão da morte responsável pela morte de milhares de pessoas. A maioria delas inocente. O livro parte das origens da criação de um sistema mortal de extermínio, demonstra seus métodos, desvenda sua consciência. Caco denuncia seus métodos de atuação e mostra como o sistema incentiva esse tipo de ação. Resultado de um rigoroso processo de investigação jornalística, este livro emblemático assume proporções de uma grave denúncia social. Armado de dados incontestáveis que surgiram de um trabalho de pesquisa de cinco anos, Barcellos desmonta as engrenagens da Rota e o perfil de seus principais matadores.",8525011185,9788525011183),,,,,"['Writing', 'Journalism', 'Nonfiction', 'Social Science']"

","El día de su muerte, Julio Carrión, poderoso hombre de negocios cuya fortuna se remonta a los años del franquismo, deja a sus hijos una sustanciosa herencia pero también muchos puntos oscuros de su pasado y de su experiencia en la Guerra Civil y en la División Azul. En su entierro, en febrero de 2005, su hijo Álvaro, el único que no ha querido dedicarse a los negocios familiares, se sorprende por la presencia de una mujer joven y atractiva, a la que nadie había visto antes y que parece delatar aspectos desconocidos de la vida íntima de su padre. Raquel Fernández Perea, por su parte, hija y nieta de exiliados en Francia, lo sabe en cambio casi todo sobre el pasado de sus progenitores y abuelos, a los que ha preguntado sobre su experiencia de la guerra y del exilio. Para ella sólo una historia permanece sin aclarar: la de una tarde en que acompañó a su abuelo, recién regresado a Madrid, y visitaron a unos desconocidos con los que intuyó que existía una deuda pendiente.Álvaro y Raquel están condenados a encontrarse porque sus respectivas historias familiares, que son también la historia de muchas familias en España, desde la Guerra Civil hasta la Transición, forman parte de sí mismos y explican además sus orígenes, su presente. También porque, sin saberlo, se sentirán atraídos sin remedio.Con El corazón helado Almudena Grandes nos entrega sin duda su novela más ambiciosa, en la que traza a través de dos familias un panorama emocionante de la historia reciente de nuestro país, y también del conflicto de las nuevas generaciones con la memoria.",8483103737,9788483103739),Paperback,,933 pages,"

","The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty.Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honour and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all.But Arlen Bales, the Painted Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honour refuse. Rather than risk defeat, Arlen cast them both from a precipice, leaving the world without a saviour, and opening a struggle for succession that threatens to tear the Free Cities of Thesa apart.In the south, Inevera, Jardir's first wife, must find a way to keep their sons from killing one another and plunging their people into civil war as they strive for enough glory to make a claim on the throne.In the north, Leesha Paper and Rojer Inn struggle to forge an alliance between the duchies of Angiers and Miln against the Krasians before it is too late.Caught in the crossfire is the duchy of Lakton – rich and unprotected, ripe for conquest.All the while, the corelings have been growing stronger, and without Arlen and Jardir there may be none strong enough to stop them.Only Renna Bales may know more about the fate of the missing men, but she, too, has disappeared…",0007425686,9780007425686),Hardcover,,768 pages,"

","Quando Eddard Stark, lorde do castelo de Winterfell, recebe a visita do velho amigo, o rei Robert Baratheon, está longe de adivinhar que a sua vida, e a da sua família, está prestes a entrar numa espiral de tragédia, conspiração e morte. Durante a estadia, o rei convida Eddard a mudar-se para a corte e a assumir a prestigiada posição de Mão do Rei. Este aceita, mas apenas porque desconfia que o anterior detentor desse título foi envenenado pela própria rainha: uma cruel manipuladora do clã Lannister. Assim, perto do rei, Eddard tem esperança de o proteger da rainha. Mas ter os Lannister como inimigos é fatal: a ambição dessa família não tem limites e o rei corre um perigo muito maior do que Eddard temia! Sozinho na corte, Eddard também se apercebe que a sua vida nada vale. E até a sua família, longe no norte, pode estar em perigo. Uma galeria de personagens brilhantes dá vida a esta saga. Entre eles estão o anão Tyrion, a ovelha negra do clã Lannister; John Snow, um bastardo de Eddard Stark que, ao ser rejeitado pela madrasta, decide juntar-se à Patrulha da Noite, uma legião encarregue de guardar uma imensa muralha de gelo a norte, para lá da qual cresce uma assustadora ameaça sobrenatural ao reino. E ainda a princesa Daenerys Targaryen, da dinastia que reinou antes de Robert Baratheon, que pretende ressuscitar os dragões do passado e, com eles, recuperar o trono, custe o que custar.",,,Paperback,Large Print,379 pages,"

","Fai bei sogni è la storia di un segreto celato in una busta per quarant'anni. La storia di un bambino, e poi di un adulto, che imparerà ad affrontare il dolore più grande, la perdita della mamma, e il mostro più insidioso: il timore di vivere. Fai bei sogni è dedicato a quelli che nella vita hanno perso qualcosa. Un amore, un lavoro, un tesoro. E rifiutandosi di accettare la realtà, finiscono per smarrire se stessi. Come il protagonista di questo romanzo. Uno che cammina sulle punte dei piedi e a testa bassa perché il cielo lo spaventa, e anche la terra. Fai bei sogni è soprattutto un libro sulla verità e sulla paura di conoscerla. Immergendosi nella sofferenza e superandola, ci ricorda come sia sempre possibile buttarsi alle spalle la sfiducia per andare al di là dei nostri limiti. Massimo Gramellini ha raccolto gli slanci e le ferite di una vita priva del suo appiglio più solido. Una lotta incessante contro la solitudine, l'inadeguatezza e il senso di abbandono, raccontata con passione e delicata ironia. Il sofferto traguardo sarà la conquista dell'amore e di un'esistenza piena e autentica, che consentirà finalmente al protagonista di tenere i piedi per terra senza smettere di alzare gli occhi al cielo.",8830429155,9788830429154),Hardcover,La Gaja Scienza,229 pages,"

","«Un relato elegante, instructivo y en ocasiones emotivo, libre de tecnicismos, sobre las poderosas influencias científicas, filosóficas y humanitarias que subyacen tras los impulsos personales de este prestigioso físico matemático. Lo recomiendo vivamente.» Sir Roger Penrose, autor de El camino a la realidad  En esta obra personal, visionaria y fascinante, Neil Turok, uno de los principales físicos teóricos mundiales, explora los descubrimientos científicos transformadores de los tres últimos siglos, desde la mecánica clásica hasta la naturaleza de la luz, desde el extraño mundo de los cuantos hasta la evolución del cosmos. Con el tiempo, cada nuevo descubrimiento ha producido tecnologías que conllevan cambios de paradigma en la estructura de la sociedad. Ahora, afirma el autor, nos hallamos en el umbral de otra transformación importante: la revolución cuántica inminente que sustituirá nuestra insatisfactoria era digital. Ante este nuevo mundo feliz, Turok llama a reinventar creativamente la manera de desarrollar y compartir el conocimiento avanzado, y a hacer posible el acceso a los enormes depósitos de talento intelectual, todavía por explorar, del mundo en vías de desarrollo. La investigación, la enseñanza y la divulgación científicas son vitales para nuestra economía futura, a la vez que poderosas fuerzas para un progreso global pacífico. Con una prosa delicada, profundamente sugestiva y muy inspiradora, El universo está dentro de nosotros aborda, por encima de todo, el futuro; el de la ciencia, el de la sociedad y el nuestro.",,,Kindle Edition,,334 pages,"

Outwardly indistinguishable from human beings, but with abilities no human can claim, the Meq search for their lost history and face a mysterious prophesied reckoning. . . .It has been thirty-eight years since Zianno–known as Z–turned twelve. In appearance, he has not aged a day. Like all Meq, Z has become accustomed to a near immortal existence, possessing an uncanny ability to recuperate from injury and resist disease. Like only four others of his kind, he holds one of the fabled Stones, the Stone of Dreams. These bearers believe it is their destiny to guide the Meq toward and through the Remembering, where it is said that they will recall their long-forgotten origins and purpose.But the rogue Meq assassin called the Fleur-du-Mal threatens their efforts and their lives. Pursuing rumors of a lost Sixth Stone, he is intent on finding the legendary talisman and eliminating anyone, Meq or human, who stands in the way. Z and his allies–Opari, Sailor, Geaxi, Nova, Ray, Mowsel, Carolina, Jack, and others–embark on a desperate quest spanning decades and continents to track down the stone before their lethal adversary gets to it first.

","In Grit to Great, Linda Kaplan Thaler and Robin Koval tackle a topic that is close to their hearts, one that they feel is the real secret to their own success in their careers--and in the careers of so many people they know and have met. And that is the incredible power of grit, perseverance, perspiration, determination, and sheer stick-to-it-tiveness. We are all dazzled by the notion that there are some people who get ahead, who reach the corner office because they are simply gifted, or well-connected, or both. But research shows that we far overvalue talent and intellectual ability in our culture. The fact is, so many people get ahead--even the gifted ones--because they worked incredibly hard, put in the thousands of hours of practice and extra sweat equity, and made their own luck. And Linda and Robin should know--they are two girls from the Bronx who had no special advantages or privileges and rose up through their own hard work and relentless drive to succeed to the top of their highly competitive profession. In a book illustrated with a cornucopia of stories and the latest research on success, the authors reveal the strategies that helped them, and countless others, succeed at the highest levels in their careers and professions, and in their personal lives. They talk about the guts--the courage--necessary to take on tough challenges and not give up at the first sign of difficulty. They discuss the essential quality of resiliency. Everyone suffers setbacks in their careers and in life. The key, however, is to pick yourself up and bounce back. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology, they discuss why optimists do better in school, work, and on the playing field--and how to reset that optimistic set point. They talk about industriousness, the notion that Malcolm Gladwell popularized with the 10,000-hour rule in his book Outliers. Creativity theorist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi believes it takes a minimum of 10 years for one's true creative potential to be realized. And the authors explore the concept of tenacity--the quality that allows us to remain focused and avoid distraction in order to get the job done--an increasingly difficult task in today's fragmented, cluttered, high-tech, connected world.Written in the same short, concise format as The Power of Nice and leavened with the natural humor that characterizes Linda's and Robin's lives--and books--Grit to Great is destined to be the book everyone in business needs.",0804139121,9780804139120),Hardcover,,160 pages,"

","The epic new chapter in the history of Malaz -- the new epic fantasy from Steven Erikson's friend and co-creator of this extraordinary and exciting imagined world. Darujhistan, city of dreams, city of blue flames, is peaceful at last; its citizens free to return to politicking, bickering, trading and, above all, enjoying the good things in life. Yet there are those who will not allow the past to remain buried. A scholar digging in the plains stumbles across an ancient sealed vault. The merchant Humble Measure schemes to drive out the remaining Malazan invaders. And the surviving agents of a long-lost power are stirring, for they sense change and so, opportunity. While, as ever at the centre of everything, a thief in a red waistcoat and of rotund proportions walks the streets, juggling in one hand custard pastries, and in the other the fate of the city itself. Far to the south, fragments of the titanic Moon's Spawn have crashed into the Rivan Sea creating a series of isles... and a fortune hunter's dream. A Malazan veteran calling himself 'Red' ventures out to try his luck -- and perhaps say goodbye to old friends. But there he finds far more than he'd bargained for as the rush to claim the Spawn's treasures descends into a mad scramble of chaos and bloodshed. For powers from across the world have gathered here, searching for the legendary Throne of Night. The impact of these events are far reaching, it seems. On an unremarkable island off the coast of Genabackis, a people who had turned their backs upon all such strivings now lift their masked faces towards the mainland and recall the ancient prophesy of a return. And what about the ex-Claw of the Malazan Empire who now walks the uttermost edge of creation? His mission -- the success or failure of which the Queen of Dreams saw long ago -- is destined to shape far more than anyone could have ever imagined.",059306450X,9780593064504),Hardcover,,605 pages,"

But with a kiss that kills anything with a soul, she's anything but normal. Half demon, half gargoyle, Layla has abilities no one else possesses. Raised among the Wardens—a race of gargoyles tasked with hunting demons and keeping humanity safe—Layla tries to fit in, but that means hiding her own dark side from those she loves the most. Especially Zayne, the swoon-worthy, incredibly gorgeous and completely off-limits Warden she's crushed on since forever. Then she meets Roth—a tattooed, sinfully hot demon who claims to know all her secrets. Layla knows she should stay away, but she's not sure she wants to—especially when that whole no-kissing thing isn't an issue, considering Roth has no soul. But when Layla discovers she's the reason for the violent demon uprising, trusting Roth could not only ruin her chances with Zayne…it could brand her a traitor to her family. Worse yet, it could become a one-way ticket to the end of the world.",0373211104,9780373211104),Paperback,,392 pages,"

Wenn aus Liebe Hass wird, kann uns nur noch die Hoffnung retten… Karous Welt ist zusammengebrochen: Ihre große Liebe, der Seraph Akiva, ist für den Tod ihrer Familie verantwortlich. Jetzt hat sie nur noch ein Ziel: den jahrtausendealten Krieg zwischen den Chimären, zu denen sie selbst gehört, und den Seraphim zu beenden.

Wer Zuzana kennt weiß allerdings, dass sie sich nicht gerne bremsen lässt…Akiva dagegen will sich unbedingt von seiner Schuld befreien.

","The story of our future begins with the Foundation. Named the best series of all time by the Hugo Awards, the Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov unquestionably comprise one of the great masterworks of science fiction, unsurpassed for its unique blend of nonstop action, daring ideas, and extensive world-building. Now, all seven volumes are together for the first time in this essential eBook bundle:   FOUNDATION FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE SECOND FOUNDATION FOUNDATION’S EDGE FOUNDATION AND EARTH PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION FORWARD THE FOUNDATION   For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying. Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future—a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save humanity, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire—both scientists and scholars—and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls this sanctuary the Foundation.   But soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire. And mankind’s last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves—or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction.   Praise for Isaac Asimov and his Foundation series   “A true polymath, a superb rationalist, an exciting and accessible writer in both fiction and nonfiction, Isaac Asimov was simply a master of all he surveyed.”—Greg Bear   “Asimov served wondrous meals-of-the-mind to a civilization that was starved for clear thinking about the future. To this day, his visions spice our ongoing dinner-table conversation about human destiny.”—David Brin   “Isaac was still in his teens when I met him, a fan of mine before I was a fan of his. Writing for John W. Campbell back in the famous ‘golden age of science fiction,’ he became one of the founders of our field. With the Robot stories and the Foundation stories, he helped to shape science fiction as we know it.”—Jack Williamson   “I grew up on the ABC’s of science fiction—Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke. There’s a reason Asimov’s name comes first, and not just because of the alphabet!”—Janis Ian   “With his fertile imagination, his wit, and his prolific output, Isaac Asimov truly laid the foundation for all future generations of science fiction writers.”—Kevin J. Anderson   “If anything can be said to have been the launch pad for space-age science fiction, it has to be the Foundation trilogy. It’s a classic. And it’s unforgettable.”—Jack McDevitt   “The Foundation series is one of the masterpieces of science fiction. If you’ve never read these novels, then you’re in for a treat, and even if you’ve already read them, then you owe it to yourself to reread them, because they’re still great.”—Allen Steele   “Quite simply, Asimov got me started.”—Liz Williams",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Sebaik mana manusia merancang, Tuhan jugalah perancang yang terbaik. Lailatul punya rencana sendiri tentang hidupnya. Tentang cita-cita dan impian. Bukan untuk hari ni tapi untuk satu hari nanti setelah usia remaja dikorbankan untuk melihat Lizahani, adiknya berjaya dan bahagia setelah ayah ibunya tiada. Namun, kecekalan dia diduga lagi. Ditangkap berdua-duaan dengan seorang lelaki asing bernama Muhamad Al-Qadr, membuatkan dia hilang punca. “Aku memang tak ada sesiapa dalam dunia ni selain kau.” - Lailatul“Itu tak ada kaitan dengan aku.” - QadrDemi rasa tanggungjawab, Qadr hulurkan tangan kepada Lailatul agar mereka sama-sama menyusuri semua cabaran biarpun tanpa cinta dalam hati. Pada Qadr, semua itu boleh dipupuk.“Haaa... Lagi satu nak sedekah dekat orang ni, biarlah sesuatu yang kita sayang. Biar orang yang tak mampu tu sama-sama merasa nikmatnya.” - Lailatul“Aku paling sayang diri sendiri. Aku hadiahkan diri aku kepada kau, boleh?” - Qadr Jodoh mereka mudah tapi mencari bahagia sedikit sukar tatkala si mentua memandang sinis kepada budak kampung seperti dia. Lailatul teguh apabila Qadr menjadi tunjangnya. Tapi, tabahnya goyah dan mula runtuh apabila maksud pernikahan mereka terbongkar. Ditambah dengan berita tentang kasih sayang dan pengorbanan yang telah lama dikhianati demi seorang lelaki bernama Zarulhakimi. Kerana dia manusia biasa, yang tahu menangis apabila sedih. Yang tahu sakit apabila dilukai.“Lai rasa abang bahagia ke? Lai rasa abang akan ikut ke permintaan Lai yang merepek tu? Atau Lai rasa Lai dah malas nak layan zahir batin abang?” - Qadr“Agaknya, Lai ni memang senang untuk diperbodohkan. Sebab tu abang, Zarul dan Liza boleh bodohkan Lai macam ni sekali.” - Lailatul“Abang tak pernah perbodohkan, Lai. Abang memang sayang…” - QadrKerana Tuhan menciptakan pasangan bersama kekuatan dan kelemahan masing-masing, Qadr tenang berpaksikan kepercayaan. Dia tak pernah kesah bagaimana mereka dipertemukan tetapi bagaimana harus mereka cipta bahagia. Sebagai seorang juruterbang jet pejuang, Qadr sedar pentas perjuangan yang lebih hakiki adalah memperjuangkan kasih mereka hingga ke syurga. Mampukah dia?",,,Paperback,,620 pages,"

It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that: (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces (2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission.

","Created in 1951 to ensure the future of an embattled Israel, the Mossad has been responsible for the most audacious and thrilling feats of espionage, counterterrorism, and assassination ever ventured. Gordon Thomas's 1999 publication of Gideon's Spies, resulting from closed-door interviews with Mossad agents, informants, and spymasters as well as from classified documents and top-secret sources, revealed previously untold truths about the Israeli intelligence agency. And now, in this edition, Thomas updates his classic text and shows the Mossad as it truly is: brilliant, ruthless, and flawed, but ultimately awesome.Three all-new chapters cover topics including:- How the Mossad planned to assassinate Saddam Hussein- Saddam's food-testing ritual, and the surprising ""source"" within his government- China's U.S.-based front-companies, and its relationship with bin Laden- Mossad's untold role in the events before and after 9/11- Mossad and revelations about Princess Diana's death- The disappearance of the millions transferred from the Vatican Bank to the Polish Solidarity movement- How extremists recruit suicide bombers, including women- Mossad's untold role in the Iraq war and the hunts for Saddam and bin Laden- Saddam's plans for trial",0312339135,9780312339135),Paperback,,480 pages,"

Her delusions walk the earth. Her hallucinations hunt her, and her skin heats to a burn every time her anger flares. Or is that all in her head?Layla doesn't know what to believe any more because if none of that’s true, Max MacLarnon must be an illusion, and her heart must still be broken. No matter how much she wants to believe Max is real, doing so would mean everything else is, too. How, then, is that possible?The answers lie in an age-old legend the supernatural aren’t prepared to reveal, and with a curse that could tear Layla and Max apart forever—if it doesn’t kill them both first.Learning the truth will mean fighting an arsenal of demons, and being with Max will put Layla on a path toward her own destruction.

To accomplish this, however, he would have to make huge sacrifices: give up a good job as an accountant in England and say goodbye to his friends and family, moving to a country in which he struggled with the language and knew next to nothing about the profession he wished to enter.Yet only a year later he was being crowned Champion de France des Fromagers, beating veteran French cheesemongers to the title and opening up a wealth of new opportunities for himself.

","Los perros de Tíndalos habitan en el pasado lejano de la Tierra, cuando la vida normal no había avanzado aún a nada superior a los seres unicelulares. Se dice que habitan en los ángulos de tiempo, mientras que los demás seres (tales como la humanidad y toda la vida común) descienden de las curvas. Se piensa que son inmortales, y que persiguen a través del tiempo a los seres humanos y demás vida normal que llama su atención (habitualmente por realizar algún tipo de desplazamiento temporal). Su apariencia es desconocida porque los personajes que se encuentran con ellos no sobreviven el tiempo suficiente para dar una descripción. Se dice que tienen largas y huecas lenguas o probóscide para drenar los líquidos corporales de sus víctimas, y que excretan una extraña pus de color azul.Aunque los perros de Tíndalos son a veces dibujados como una criatura canina (probablemente debido al evocador título del primer relato en el que aparecieron), no es probable que luzcan como tal, ya que el nombre sólo refleja sus hábitos cazadores, no su apariencia. Algunas obras posteriores sugieren que su apariencia podría ser de un aspecto mucho más monstruoso y similar al de un murciélago.Debido a su relación con los ángulos de tiempo, los perros de Tíndalos pueden materializarse a través de cualquier ángulo, siempre que sea suficientemente cerrado (120º o menos). Cuando un perro de Tíndalos está a punto de aparecer, se materializa en primer lugar como humo desde la esquina, y finalmente emerge la cabeza, seguida por el cuerpo. Tal es el método que estas criaturas utilizan para desplazarse a través del tiempo.",,,ebook,,12 pages,"

","Not since The Diary of Anne Frank has there been such a book as this: The joyful but ultimately heartbreaking journal of a young Jewish woman in occupied Paris, now being published for the first time, 63 years after her death in a Nazi concentration camp.On April 7, 1942, Hélène Berr, a 21-year-old Jewish student of English literature at the Sorbonne, took up her pen and started to keep a journal, writing with verve and style about her everyday life in Paris — about her studies, her friends, her growing affection for the “boy with the grey eyes,” about the sun in the dewdrops, and about the effect of the growing restrictions imposed by France’s Nazi occupiers. Berr brought a keen literary sensibility to her writing, a talent that renders the story it relates all the more rich, all the more heartbreaking. The first day Berr has to wear the yellow star on her coat, she writes, “I held my head high and looked people so straight in the eye they turned away. But it’s hard.” More, many more, humiliations were to follow, which she records, now with a view to posterity. She wants the journal to go to her fiancé, who has enrolled with the Free French Forces, as she knows she may not live much longer. She was right. The final entry is dated February 15, 1944, and ends with the chilling words: “Horror! Horror! Horror!” Berr and her family were arrested three weeks later. She went — as was discovered later — on the death march from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen, where she died of typhus in April 1945, within a month of Anne Frank and just days before the liberation of the camp.The journal did eventually reach her fiancé, and for over fifty years it was kept private. In 2002, it was donated to the Memorial of the Shoah in Paris. Before it was first published in France in January 2008, translation rights had already been sold for twelve languages.",0771013132,9780771013133),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","Show Up and Let Yourself be Seen Is vulnerability the same as weakness? “In our culture,” teaches Dr. Brené Brown, “we associate vulnerability with emotions we want to avoid such as fear, shame, and uncertainty. Yet we too often lose sight of the fact that vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, belonging, creativity, authenticity, and love.” On The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brown offers an invitation and a promise - that when we dare to drop the armor that protects us from feeling vulnerable, we open ourselves to the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Here she dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and reveals that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.“The Power of Vulnerability is a very personal project for me,” Brené explains. “This is the first place that all of my work comes together. This audio course draws from all three of my books - it’s the culmination of everything I’ve learned over the past twelve years. I'm very excited to weave it all into a truly comprehensive form that shows what these findings and insights can mean in our lives.”Guidance and Insights for Wholehearted LivingOver the past twelve years, Dr. Brené Brown has interviewed hundreds of people as part of an ongoing study of vulnerability. “The research shows that we try to ward disappointment with a shield of cynicism, disarm shame by numbing ourselves against joy, and circumvent grief by shutting off our willingness to love,” explains Dr. Brown. When we become aware of these patterns, she teaches, we begin to become conscious of how much we sacrifice in the name of self-defense -and how much richer our lives become when we open ourselves to vulnerability.“In my research,” Dr. Brown says, “the word I use to describe people who can live from a place of vulnerability is wholehearted.” Being wholehearted is a practice—one that we can choose to cultivate through empathy, gratitude, and awareness of our vulnerability armor. Join this engaging and heartfelt teacher on The Power of Vulnerability as she offers profound insights on leaning into the full spectrum of emotions—so we can show up, let ourselves be seen, and truly be all in.HIGHLIGHTSCultivating shame resilience—the key to developing a sense of worth and belonging.Vulnerability as the origin point for innovation, adaptability, accountability, and visionary leadership.Our emotional armory - how we use perfectionism, numbing, and other tactics to avoid feeling vulnerable.The myths of vulnerability - common misconceptions about weakness, trust, and self-sufficiency.Discovering your vulnerability armor - recognizing what makes us shut down, and how we can change.The 10 guideposts of wholehearted living - essential skills for becoming fully engaged in life.Six hours of stories, warm humor, and transformative insights for living a life of courage, authenticity, and compassion from Dr. Brené Brown.",,,Audible Audio,,7 pages,"

","Winner of the SILVER MEDAL in the 2014 Readers' Favorite annual International Award Contest—Category YA Paranormal Romance. Ever since she can remember, Sonia has had to abide by her parents' ridiculously unfair rules like not being allowed to date or even kiss a guy. The only reason she thinks she's being held to these rules is when Sonia was eight, she took a sip of her friend’s drink, causing her friend to do everything Sonia asked. As her eighteenth birthday approaches, Sonia is finally about to learn why; she's a Huldra, a dangerous, yet seductive and magical Norse forest maiden who with just one kiss, has the ability to control humans and appropriate parts of their souls. Keeping the rules hasn't been a problem for Sonia because she's never really been attracted to any guy. But when Anthony transfers to her school, every last rule flies out the window. There's just something about Anthony that she can't resist—the way he seems to be hiding a deep, dark secret that is connected to her, the way his mysterious blue eyes cause her heart to beat more rapidly, his athletic, god-like physique. The closer she gets to her eighteenth birthday—the moment she matures into a fully realized Huldra—the harder it becomes to follow her parents' rules. As graduation day approaches, Anthony starts to show interest in her, but she would never have guessed how life-changing and how dangerous Anthony's secrets are, and how overwhelmingly intense a relationship with him could be. Suspenseful, passionate and gripping, E. J.

","By the time Richard Trenton Chase graduated high school, everyone knew he was strange. But no one had any idea how bizarre he'd become, or what dark impulses were flowing through his troubled brain. The transformation from the outwardly strange young man to the diabolical killer he ultimately became, was gradual and would not become known until it was too late. First it was the killing of small animals and birds, and the drinking of their blood. However, when these sacrifices failed to satiate his needs, Richard Chase would seek out the highest form of life, and the city of Sacramento, California would react in horror to the hideous murders and mutilations committed by his hands. For those living in the quiet neighborhoods where the murders occurred, it was nothing less than a time of terror until the fiend was captured.Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders (with 23 photos), is an in-depth look into the life and disturbed mind of a killer, his family, and his many victims, the living as well as the dead. Within these pages you'll discover what it was like for the police, and what a difficult job they had finding a killer they knew wouldn't stop until he was apprehended. It was a race against time, in a series of murders that would stun even the most hardened investigators. It is the story of a city under siege, held captive by the man whose appetite for blood could not be satiated.",,,ebook,,97 pages,"

","Every day we make choices. Coke or Pepsi? Save or spend? Stay or go?  Whether mundane or life-altering, these choices define us and shape our lives. Sheena Iyengar asks the difficult questions about how and why we choose: Is the desire for choice innate or bound by culture? Why do we sometimes choose against our best interests? How much control do we really have over what we choose? Sheena Iyengar's award-winning research reveals that the answers are surprising and profound. In our world of shifting political and cultural forces, technological revolution, and interconnected commerce, our decisions have far-reaching consequences.

","What elevates 'teaching my mother how to give birth', what gives the poems their disturbing brilliance, is Warsan Shire's ability to give simple, beautiful eloquence to the veiled world where sensuality lives in the dominant narrative of Islam; reclaiming the more nuanced truths of earlier times - as in Tayeb Salih's work - and translating to the realm of lyric the work of the likes of Nawal El Saadawi. As Rumi said, ""Love will find its way through all languages on its own"". In 'teaching my mother how to give birth', Warsan's debut pamphlet, we witness the unearthing of a poet who finds her way through all preconceptions to strike the heart directly. Warsan Shire is a Kenyan-born Somali poet and writer who is based in London. Born in 1988, she is an artist and activist who uses her work to document narratives of journey and trauma. Warsan has read her work internationally, including recent readings in South Africa, Italy and Germany, and her poetry has been translated into Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.",1905233299,9781905233298),Paperback,,37 pages,"

","The beloved bestseller that offers a practical, inspiring new roadmap for raising self-reliant, ethical, and compassionate children.In the trenches of a typical day, every parent encounters a child afflicted with ingratitude and entitlement. In a world where material abundance abounds, parents want so badly to raise self-disciplined, appreciative, and resourceful children who are not spoiled by the plentitude around them. But how to accomplish this feat? The answer has eluded the best-intentioned mothers and fathers who overprotect, overindulge, and overschedule their children's lives.Dr. Mogel helps parents learn how to turn their children's worst traits into their greatest attributes. Starting with stories of everyday parenting problems and examining them through the lens of the Torah, the Talmud, and important Jewish teachings, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee shows parents how to teach children to honor their parents and to respect others, escape the danger of overvaluing children's need for self-expression so that their kids don't become ""little attorneys,"" accept that their children are both ordinary and unique, and treasure the power and holiness of the present moment.It is Mogel's singular achievement that she makes these teachings relevant for any era and any household of any faith. A unique parenting book, designed for use both in the home and in parenting classes, with an on-line teaching guide to help facilitate its use, The Blessing of a Skinned Knee is both inspiring and effective in the day-to-day challenge of raising self-reliant children.",1416593063,9781416593065),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","In the Urwald, you don’t step off the path. Trolls, werewolves, and butter-churn riding witches lurk amid the clawing branches, eager to swoop up the unwary. Jinx has always feared leaving the path—then he meets the wizard Simon Magus. Jinx knows that wizards are evil. But Simon’s kitchen is cozy, and he seems cranky rather than wicked. Staying with him appears to be Jinx’s safest, and perhaps only, option. As Jinx’s curiosity about magic grows, he learns to listen to the trees as closely as he does to Simon’s unusual visitors. The more Jinx discovers, the more determined he becomes to explore beyond the security of well-trod paths. But in the Urwald, a little healthy fear is never out of place, for magic—and magicians—can be as dangerous as the forest, and soon Jinx must decide which is the greater threat. Sage Blackwood introduces a daring new hero for an innovative new world as Jinx is joined by friends, battles enemies, and discovers life beyond—and even within—the forest is more complex than he can imagine, and that the Urwald itself needs him more than he could ever guess.",0062129902,9780062129901),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

It began for our narrator forty years ago when the family lodger stole their car and committed suicide in it, stirring up ancient powers best left undisturbed. Dark creatures from beyond the world are on the loose, and it will take everything our narrator has just to stay alive: there is primal horror here, and menace unleashed - within his family and from the forces that have gathered to destroy it. His only defense is three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of them claims that her duckpond is ocean.

Manchmal waren es die großen geographischen: das Kap von Südafrika, Patagonien, der Himalaja, die Südseeinseln von Tonga, der Nordpol. Manchmal waren es aber auch ganz einzigartige, individuelle Endpunkte: eine Bahnstation in Birma, ein Bett in Minsk, ein Fresko des Jüngsten Gerichts in Orvieto, eine Behörde im kriegszerrütteten Kongo. Immer aber geht es in diesen grandiosen literarischen Reisebildern auch um ein Enden in anderem Sinn: um ein Ende der Liebe und des Begehrens, der Illusionen, der Ordnung und Verständigung.

","La hora del Diablo es un relato fascinante de Fernando Pessoa. Un dialogo entre Satan y Maria, madre de Jesus, que revela al lector el singular pensamiento del poeta-filosofo, suerte de mistico que quiere creer, pero descree por principio. La conversacion -casi un monologo del Diablo- es n peregrinaje ""del misterio y del conocimiento,"" en busca de una ""verdad inalcanzable (...) que ni Dios conoce."" Pessoa nos presenta al Diablo como complementario de Dios, como ""senor absoluto del intersticio y de lo intermedio, de lo que en la vida no es vida."" ""Como la noche es mi reino -dice Satan-, el sueno es mi dominio."" Este breve texto, sutil y sugerente, no es una mera curiosidad en la obra del gran escritor portuges, sino el testimonio hecho ficcion de un inquietud permanente de su espiritu.

Our culture is filled with vacuity and pap, and we are told there’s nothing we can do: “It’s just the way things are.”   In this book, Russell Brand hilariously lacerates the straw men and paper tigers of our conformist times and presents, with the help of experts as diverse as Thomas Piketty and George Orwell, a vision for a fairer, sexier society that’s fun and inclusive.   You have been lied to, told there’s no alternative, no choice, and that you don’t deserve any better. Brand destroys this illusory facade as amusingly and deftly as he annihilates Morning Joe anchors, Fox News fascists, and BBC stalwarts.   This book makes revolution not only possible but inevitable and fun.",1101882913,9781101882917),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","In Jewish scripture, there is a legend: There are thirty-six righteous people on earth. The thirty-six protect us. Without them, humanity would perish. But the thirty-six do not know they are the chosen ones. In Beijing, a monk collapses in his chamber, dead. A fiery mark—a tattoo? a burn?—spreads across his back and down his spine. In Mumbai, a beloved economist, a man who served the poor, dies suddenly. His corpse reveals the same symbol. Similar deaths are reported around the world—the victims all humanitarians, all with the same death mark. In Venice, an enterprising Italian policeman links the deaths, tracing the evidence. Who is killing good people around the world? In Copenhagen, police are preparing for a world climate summit when they receive the Interpol alert. The task falls to veteran detective Niels Bentzon: Find the “good people” of Denmark and warn them. But Bentzon is a man who is trained to see the worst in humanity, not the good. One by one, people are crossed off his list. He senses their secrets and wrongdoings. Just as Bentzon is ready to give up, he meets Hannah Lund, a brilliant astrophysicist mourning the death of her son and the implosion of her marriage. With Hannah’s help, Bentzon begins to piece together the puzzle of these far-flung deaths. A pattern emerges. It is, they realize, a perfectly executed plan of murder.

","Widely regarded as a great stylist of 20th-century English literature, Joyce deserves the term 'revolutionary'. His literary experiments in form & structure, language & content, signaled the modernist movement & continue to influence writers today. His two earliest, most accessible, successes--A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man & Dubliners--are here brought together in one volume. Both reflect his lifelong love-hate relationship with Dublin & the Irish culture that formed him.  In the semi-autobiographical Portrait, young Stephen Dedalus yearns to be an artist, but 1st must struggle against the forces of church, school & society, which fetter his imagination & stifle his soul. The book's inventive style is apparent from its opening pages, a record of an infant's impressions of the world around him--one of the 1st examples of the stream of consciousness technique. Comprising 15 stories, Dubliners presents a community of mesmerizing, humorous & haunting characters--a group portrait. The interactions among them form one long meditation on the human condition, culminating with 'The Dead', one of Joyce's most graceful compositions centering around a character's epiphany. A carefully woven tapestry of Dublin life at the turn of the last century, Dubliners realizes Joyce's ambition to give his countrymen 'one good look at themselves.'",9544281797,9544281797,Hardcover,,672 pages,"

London is on fire from the Blitz, and a young woman gardener named Gwen Davis flees from the burning city for the Devon countryside.

Also on the estate, waiting to be posted, is a regiment of Canadian soldiers. For three months, the young women and men will form attachments, living in a temporary rural escape. No one will be more changed by the stay than Gwen. She will inspire the girls to restore the estate gardens, fall in love with a soldier, find her first deep friendship, and bring a lost garden, created for a great love, back to life. While doing so, she will finally come to know herself and a life worth living. Reading group guide included.",,,Kindle Edition,,193 pages,"

If Lucia's parents become suspicious, his life--and all of Sera's hopes--will be extinguished. Political intrigue, dangerous liaisons, and spine-tingling suspense swirl like a maelstrom in this penultimate book in the WaterFire saga",1423182014,9781423182016),Hardcover,,392 pages,"

SINOPSIS
 ¿Qué serías capaz de hacer para salvar tu vida? Caracas, Oslo, Madrid, Cancún, Sur de Francia. Una historia contrarreloj. Pat MacMillan, agente de la División de Contrainteligencia de los servicios secretos españoles, trabaja en un departamento que no tiene nombre ni figura en el organigrama. Se ocupa de operaciones de las que ningún otro de los tres mil quinientos agentes de ""La Casa"" pueden ocuparse, salvo que estén dispuestos a ir a la cárcel por violar en una misma mañana cuatro o cinco artículos del Código Penal. Cuando en pleno día de Nochebuena se dispone a comenzar unas largas vacaciones, recibe dos malas noticias. La primera de ellas, que el Centro Nacional de Inteligencia tiene infiltrado entre sus agentes un topo de la organización terrorista ETA. La segunda, que el agente elegido por el Gobierno para identificar al topo y detenerlo es él. A través de la investigación del caso, el esclarecimiento de una serie de misteriosos asesinatos en cadena y la lucha por desactivar un inminente atentado terrorista de terribles consecuencias, el lector de este trepidante thriller conseguirá desvelar toda la verdad sobre el caso, que solo llegará al final de un largo, intrincado y apasionante recorrido que demostrará que las cosas no son siempre como parecen. O tal vez si…

","Hayao Miyazaki was a budding filmmaker in 1982 when he agreed to collaborate on a project with the popular Japanese anime magazine Animage. This was Nausicaa, which would make Miyazaki's reputation as much as his 11 films and TV shows. Set in the far future, Nausicaa visualizes an Earth radically changed by ecological disaster. Strange human kingdoms survive at the edge of the Sea of Corruption, a poisonous fungal forest. Nausicaa, a gentle young princess, has a telepathic bond with the giant mutated insects of this dystopia. Her task is to negotiate peace between kingdoms battling over the last of the world's precious natural resources. Nausicaa took Miyazaki 12 years to create, in part because he worked with few or no assistants, doing both the writing and drawing using a meticulously detailed style that critics have compared to the work of the French artist Moebius.",1591163552,9781591163558),Paperback,,223 pages,"

","Blaise Pascal, the precociously brilliant contemporary of Descartes, was a gifted mathematician and physicist, but it is his unfinished apologia for the Christian religion upon which his reputation now rests. The Penseés is a collection of philosohical fragments, notes and essays in which Pascal explores the contradictions of human nature in pscyhological, social, metaphysical and - above all - theological terms. Mankind emerges from Pascal's analysis as a wretched and desolate creature within an impersonal universe, but who can be transformed through faith in God's grace.",,,,,318 pages,"

This work book is a basic, at-home NLP course, providing easy-to-follow exercises and reflections to which the reader can return time and again. It addresses topics such as How to Change Emotional State, the Power of Language and Getting Results, and can be applied to all kinds of different areas e.g. business, sport, health.The NLP workbook is designed to be a basic manual for the beginner in NLP, and also a clear and easy reference manual for practioners and trainers.",0007100035,9780007100033),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Este es un libro diferente a cualquier ensayo sobre el cáncer y a cualquier novela basada en las experiencias personales de las personas afectadas por la enfermedad: en estas páginas son los conflictos de los investigadores los que conducen al conocimiento de las diversas aristas del cáncer, son los pensamientos e hipótesis de los científicos los que permiten comprender las bases moleculares, las teorías existentes, la psicooncología, y, en última instancia, lo que derivó en el final inesperado de un grupo de científicos desbordados por sus pasiones y sentimientos. Punto de inflexión es una novela que no está habitada por estereotipos, científicos simpáticos y divertidos, sino por personas reales dedicadas a la investigación, es una historia donde los conocimientos no se presentan como bits de información sino como material abierto para razonar e hipotetizar al respecto, tal como los investigadores muchas veces deben hacer para abordar su trabajo.

Not so much a stream of consciousness, as an unconscious railing against a life that makes little sense, and a shocking and intimate insight into the thoughts, feelings and chaotic sexuality of a vulnerable and isolated protagonist. To read A Girl Is A Half-Formed Thing is to plunge inside its narrator's head, experiencing her world first-hand. This isn't always comfortable - but it is always a revelation.Touching on everything from family violence to sexuality and the personal struggle to remain intact in times of intense trauma, McBride writes with singular intensity, acute sensitivity and mordant wit.

","Welcome to the United States of America in the 1880s: Settlers are moving west, as do the iron horses that bring them by rail ... and somewhere in those vast regions of deserts and native tribes, a darkness is gathering. Calls Thunder Song, a powerful Shoshone shaman, senses it first, and reaches out to the Western Council, an association of magi and other magical folk, for possible insight and assistance. In response, the Council sends a single magus, Aquinas Moore, as a token gesture, but what starts as a simple diplomatic mission for Aquinas turns into a struggle for existence against a foe more terrible than any of them has ever encountered, which has already infiltrated the halls of power. Now, these unlikely allies must band together with a pair of Native American deities and a dead man to fight off a threat from outside the universe, a threat that intends to not only conquer, but change the very nature of existence.",1940233186,9781940233185),Paperback,,198 pages,"

","Роман, который лауреат Пулитцеровской премии Донна Тартт писала более 10 лет, — огромное эпическое полотно о силе искусства и о том, как оно — подчас совсем не так, как нам того хочется — способно перевернуть всю нашу жизнь. 13-летний Тео Декер чудом остался жив после взрыва, в котором погибла его мать. Брошенный отцом, без единой родной души на всем свете, он скитается по приемным домам и чужим семьям — от Нью-Йорка до Лас-Вегаса, — и его единственным утешением, которое, впрочем, чуть не приводит к его гибели, становится украденный им из музея шедевр голландского старого мастера.",517085448X,9785170854486),Hardcover,,827 pages,"

Este libro reúne los recuerdos de cientos de ellas, mujeres que fueron francotiradoras, condujeron tanques o trabajaron en hospitales de campaña. Su historia no es una historia de la guerra, ni de los combates, es la historia de hombres y mujeres en guerra.¿Qué les ocurrió? ¿Cómo les transformó? ¿De qué tenían miedo? ¿Cómo era aprender a matar? Estas mujeres, la mayoría por primera vez en sus vidas, cuentan la parte no heroica de la guerra, a menudo ausente de los relatos de los veteranos. Hablan de la suciedad y del frío, del hambre y de la violencia sexual, de la angustia y de la sombra omnipresente de la muerte.

After they stumble across a power no one thought existed, they escape together, and are quickly thrust into a life they didn't know they had. They learn about their lives but something still seems missing. Constantly on the run, they attempt to dig into their past and find out who put them there.

","This book is about the great moral issues underlying many of the headline-making political controversies of our times. It is not a comforting book but a book about disturbing and dangerous trends. The Quest for Cosmic Justice shows how confused conceptions of justice end up promoting injustice, how confused conceptions of equality end up promoting inequality, and how the tyranny of social visions prevents many people from confronting the actual consequences of their own beliefs and policies. Those consequences include the steady and dangerous erosion of fundamental principles of freedom - amounting to a quiet repeal of the American revolution. The Quest for Cosmic Justice is the summation of a lifetime of study and thought about where we as a society are headed - and why we need to change course before we do irretrievable damage.",0684864630,9780684864631),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","Read by Danny Glover, with an introduction by Kofi Annan.  Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's antiapartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is his moving and exhilarating autobiography, destined to take its place among the finest memoirs of history's greatest figures. Here for the first time, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela tells the extraordinary story of his life--an epic of struggle, setback, renewed hope, and ultimate triumph.",1586216880,9781586216887),Audio CD,Abridged,6 pages,"

","A gorgeous literary debut about an elderly woman’s last great adventure walking across Canada. A beautiful novel of pilgrimage, of fulfilling lifelong promises, of a talking coyote called James, of unlikely heroes and hundreds of papier-mâché animals…Eighty-two-year-old Etta has never seen the ocean. So early one morning she takes a rifle, some chocolate, and her best boots, and begins walking the 3,232 kilometers from Saskatchewan to Halifax. Her husband Otto wakes to a note left on the kitchen table. I will try to remember to come back, Etta writes. Otto has seen the ocean, having crossed the Atlantic years ago to fight in a far-away war, so he understands. But with Etta gone, the memories come crowding in. The only way to keep them at bay is to keep his hands busy. Russell, raised as a brother to Otto, has loved Etta from afar for sixty years. He insists on finding Etta, wherever she’s gone. Leaving his farm will be the first act of defiance in his whole life.As Etta walks toward the ocean - accompanied by a coyote named James - memory, illusion, and reality blur. Like the gentle undulation of waves, Etta and Otto and Russell and James moves from a past filled with of hunger, war, passion, and hope to a present of quiet industry and peaceful communion; from trying to remember to trying to forget. A beautiful novel that reminds us that it’s never too late to see the things you've longed to see, or to say the things you've longed to say.",0670067741,9780670067749),Hardcover,,305 pages,"

","This compelling story of Bertrande de Rols is a rich novella with the timeless power of a fable. It was based on a famous story of a court case in mid-16th century France. Janet Lewis depicts a distant time and a traditional, rural culture based on a highly ordered patriarchal structure. When ""Martin Guerre"" returns from a quest after eight years, the family embraces him, and Bertrande is swept up in the relief at the apparent return to the security of the old order. But Martin has changed, and Bertrande threatens the established order with her defiant quest for the truth. Once the accusation of false identity is laid formally and the trial process begins. Many witnesses are called. Bertrande is pressured to withdraw, and she herself is reluctant to see ""Martin"" executed. Finally, the real, battle-weary Martin stumbles into the courtroom and is instantly recognized. He shows no mercy to Bertrande for allowing herself to be deceived. The real facts emerge, but the fate of Bertrande and Martin remains open-ended.",0804003211,9780804003216),Paperback,,109 pages,"

"," Wolfgang Leonhards 1954 erstmals erschienenes Buch Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder, ist längst zu einem Klassiker der Kommunismusforschung avanciert. Zu Recht, denn auch nach 45 Jahren hat es nichts von seiner Aktualität und Brillanz verloren. Wer die inneren Funktionsmechanismen des Stalinismus verstehen will, kommt an Leonhards Buch nicht vorbei. Doch was macht das Besondere seiner Arbeit aus? Der Autor genießt einen entscheidenden Vorteil bei der Analyse des Stalinismus: Die Erfahrungen eines zehnjährigen Lebens in der Sowjetunion und der vierjährigen Tätigkeit als Funktionär im zentralen Apparat der SED-Führung. 1935 nach Moskau emigriert, erlebte Leonhard die große stalinistische Säuberung der Jahre 1936 bis 1938 und wurde ab 1942 auf der Schule der Kommunistischen Internationale zum Funktionär ausgebildet. Im Mai 1945 kehrte er zusammen mit Walter Ulbricht nach Deutschland zurück. Bis zu seiner überraschenden Flucht nach Jugoslawien im März 1949 war er im Zentralkomitee der KPD/SED mit der ideologischen Schulung der Parteifunktionäre betraut. In dieser Funktion lernte Leonhard viele der damaligen Repräsentanten der sowjetischen Besatzungszone und der späteren DDR persönlich kennen. Es ist diese intime Kenntnis der inneren Mechanismen des Systems: Die Möglichkeit, sich in die Menschen der kommunistischen Welt hineinzudenken und die Fähigkeit, die für viele so rätselhafte ideologische Wortklauberei entziffern zu können, die sein Werk auszeichnen. Vieles, was dem Außenstehenden oft so unwahrscheinlich anmutet, erscheint dem früheren Funktionär ""von drüben"" wie ein offenes Buch. Diese Kenntnisse befähigen Leonhard, die Entwicklungen in der kommunistischen Welt objektiv zu analysieren. ""Gleichermaßen entfernt von primitivem Antikommunismus und den Haßgefühlen, aber auch von Schönfärberei und Illusionen"", wie er 1990 anläßlich der Neuauflage von Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder schrieb. Es ist dieser unverfälschte Blick eines Insiders, der dem Buch jenes Maß an Authentizität und Glaubwürdigkeit verleiht, das es bis heute auszeichnet. --Stephan Fingerle",3462034987,9783462034981),Hardcover,,698 pages,"

","Triunghiuri amoroase sunt destule in amandoua romanele lui Camil Petrescu de dinainte de razboi. Combustibilul care pune dorinta in miscare este, in amandoua, vanitatea. Daca pasiunea se analizeaza si formeaza obiectul prozei psihologice, vanitatea se reflecta in gesturi si formeaza obiectul prozei comportiste. Camil Petrescu, atat de dator lui Proust in tezele lui despre roman, nu-i datoreaza mare lucru in romane ca atare. Patul lui Procust e romanul unor vanitati ranite: a doamnei T. si a lui Fred Vasilescu, in primul rand. Tocmai ale celor carora Autorul le da cuvantul, pe care-i indeamna sa scrie. Doamna T. reuseste mai bine sa se confeseze, desi nici ea pana la capat. Fred Vasilescu, in schimb, nu vorbeste deloc despre el insusi (nu aflam niciodata de ce o paraseste pe doamna T., pe care o iubea), preferand sa se ocupe de Ladima si de Emilia, a caror relatie il intriga, fiindca nu descifreaza in ea nicio urma de vanitate. Din contra, o patima greu stapanita la Ladima, iar la Emilia un vag dispret de femeie nesatisfacuta de darurile preponderent epistolare ale poetului indragostit.",9739223419,9739223419,paperback,,296 pages,"

","Negli anni Settanta Oriana Fallaci è un mito. Prima il Vietnam, poi Città del Messico e infine la storia d’amore con Alekos Panagulis, eroe della Resistenza greca, simbolo dell’opposizione a qualunque regime liberticida. Dopo la morte di lui e la pubblicazione di Un uomo, Oriana riesce a creare un incantamento globale: vorrebbero essere come lei i tanti giovani e meno giovani attratti dalla personalità dei suoi reportage di guerra e dal suo coraggio. E vorrebbero essere come lei molte donne, per le quali la scrittrice rappresenta la realizzazione di un sogno. In quegli anni la Fallaci accetta i sempre più frequenti inviti a incontrare i suoi lettori stranieri, nelle città e nelle università del mondo. Questo libro raccoglie alcune delle sue conferenze di maggior rilievo, pagine rimaste finora inedite che rivelano il suo rapporto con la scrittura, la sua passione per la politica e per l’impegno civile, la sua “ossessione per la libertà”. È il suo autoritratto più autentico, una sorta di manifesto in cui Oriana rivendica e difende con vigore il diritto a “stare dalla parte dell’umanità, suggerire i cambiamenti, innamorarci dei buoni cambiamenti, influenzare un futuro che sia un futuro migliore del presente”.",8817061271,9788817061278),Hardcover,Opere di Oriana Fallaci,208 pages,"

","Seemannsgarn vom Feinsten: ein Feuerwerk bäriger Ideen Daß Walter Moers mehr als das Kleine Arschloch zeichnen kann, hat er längst bewiesen. Sogar in den Sprechblasen ist er hervorragend ohne Worte ausgekommen, als der Pinguin zweimal klopfte. Und nun sein erster Roman: Eine genial dicke Schwarte von 720 Seiten, in der ein Geistesblitz den nächsten jagt. Grün und gelb möchte man vor Neid werden: Wo hat der Mann bloß die vielen Ideen her? In seinen dreizehneinhalb Leben begegnet der Blaubär gehässigen Stollentrollen, unangenehmen Nattifftoffen, quasselnden Tratschwellen, durch die Wüste ziehenden Gimpeln, dem Wahnsinn, Fredda, der Berghutze -- eine Figur skurriler als die andere. Ab und an illustriert der Zeichner Moers die Gestalten des Erzählers Moers, ein Glücksfall natürlich, aber im Vordergrund steht der Text, unerschütterlich. Und hier entfaltet sich in vollen Zügen, was der eine oder andere bereits geahnt haben mag: Moers ist ein begnadeter, ironischer Erzähler. Mit wieviel Sprachwitz er arbeitet, wie er an Ausdrücken feilt, Begegnungen verschachtelt komponiert, Satzrhythmen herstellt und wieder auflöst, das nötigt Respekt ab. Und man freut sich über die irrwitzigen Inhalte der Abenteuer. Ob er mit dem Rettungssaurier Mac als Navigator fliegt, eine Fata Morgana am Wüstenboden verklebt, durch Dimensionslöcher stürzt oder sich ein Duell mit dem Lügengladiator liefert: die Spannung bleibt ungebrochen (außer beim sechsten Kapitel), die unzähligen Geschichten sind unglaublich. Münchhausen entpuppt sich als blutiger Lehrling im Vergleich zu Moers. Auch wenn sich beim Lesen gelegentlich Assoziationen zu Texten von Michael Ende oder Janosch einstellen mögen: Der Roman ist kein Kinderbuch, sondern nachdenklich machende (haben Sie schon mal über eine Tornado-Haltestelle nachgedacht?) Literatur, die bestens unterhält. Das vielgesuchte Leichte, das so schwer zu machen ist: hier ist es. --Sophie Thoma",344245381X,9783442453818),Paperback,,703 pages,"

","Reagan Forrester wants out—out of her trailer park, out of reach of her freeloading mother, and out of the shadow of the relationship that made her the pariah of Charytan, Kansas. Victoria Reyes wants in—in to a fashion design program, in to the arms of a cute guy who doesn’t go to Charytan High, and in to a city where she won’t stand out for being Mexican. One thing the polar-opposite best friends do agree on is that wherever they go, they’re staying together. But when they set off on a series of college visits at the start of their senior year, they quickly see that the future doesn’t look quite like they expected. After two years of near-solitude following the betrayal of the ex-boyfriend who broke her heart, Reagan falls hard and fast for a Battlestar Galactica-loving, brilliant smile-sporting pre-med prospective…only to learn she’s set herself up for heartbreak all over again. Meanwhile, Victoria runs full-speed toward all the things she thinks she wants…only to realize everything she’s looking for might be in the very place they’ve sworn to leave. As both Reagan and Victoria struggle to learn who they are and what they want in the present, they discover just how much they don’t know about each other’s pasts. And when each learns what the other’s been hiding, they’ll have to decide whether their friendship has a future.",1633920534,9781633920538),Paperback,,407 pages,"

","All three books in the highly praised Dust Lands trilogy, which MTV’s Hollywood Crush blog called “better than The Hunger Games,” are now available in a collectible paperback boxed set.In Blood Red Road, Saba is forced to flee Silverlake, a dried-up wasteland ravaged by constant sandstorms, when four cloaked horsemen capture her beloved twin brother Lugh. Suddenly thrown into the lawless, ugly reality of the outside world, Saba discovers she is a fierce fighter—and when she teams up with a handsome daredevil named Jack and a gang of girl revolutionaries, Saba stages a showdown that will change the course of her civilization. The action continues in Rebel Heart when a new enemy arises, and Saba needs all of her warrior’s strength just to survive. The stakes only get higher in Raging Star. Because although Saba knows how to fight—she’s not called the Angel of Death for nothing—sometimes there are fights that cannot be won. How much will she sacrifice to save the people she loves?This riveting trilogy is “a natural for Hunger Games fans” (Publishers Weekly) that makes an ideal gift.",1481440098,9781481440097),Paperback,,1376 pages,"

Blue-eyed and high-spirited, Elfride has little experience of the world beyond, and becomes entangled with two men: the boyish architect, Stephen Smith, and the older literary man, Henry Knight. The former friends become rivals, and Elfride faces an agonizing choice. Written at a crucial time in Hardy's life, A Pair of Blue Eyes expresses more directly than any of his novels the events and social forces that made him the writer he was. Elfride's dilemma mirrors the difficult decision Hardy himself had to make with this novel: to pursue the profession of architecture, where he was established, or literature, where he had yet to make his name.

Curl up with Prince Theon this Christmas...




Nineteen year old Penelope ""Nell"" O'Hara is geared up for the worst Christmas of her life. The guy she's been dating just dumped her for her best friend, and all she has to look forward to over the break is a stay in Beggar's Hole--a tiny frozen town on the coast of Maine--with her retired father, his latest masseuse girlfriend and her brattish fourteen year old son. But one night, after storming out of dinner to take a brooding walk among the rocks, a misstep on the ice causes Nell's Christmas to take rather a different turn...  She would have died, were it not for a mysterious, heat-exuding hero arriving out of nowhere to scoop her up in his arms, and warm and dry her body. Coming to, Nell finds herself staring up into a pair of deep gold eyes. Eyes belonging to a man who is quite unlike any she's seen before. His features are chiseled yet sensual, exotic but somber, like something beautiful and wild threatened by extinction. All of six and a half feet tall, and two hundred plus pounds of pure muscle, her savior introduces himself as Theon Aena. His mere touch sends heat surging through her body, reaching down into her fingers and toes, even fluttering from her hair follicles, and his proximity to her brings about strange shudders of pleasure.After a twist of fate causes her to cross paths with Theon again, Nell's drab, frozen Christmas soon spirals into a firestorm of passion, romance, revelations, and danger...

","Finalist for the Edgar® Award in Best Fact Crime.Nominee for Foreword Reviews INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award in True Crime.A New York Post Favorite Books of 2015 honoree.A Suspense Magazine Best True Crime Books of 2015.The king of the Florida pill mills was American Pain, a mega-clinic expressly created to serve addicts posing as patients. From a fortress-like former bank building, American Pain's doctors distributed massive quantities of oxycodone to hundreds of customers a day, mostly traffickers and addicts who came by the vanload. Inked muscle-heads ran the clinic's security. Former strippers operated the pharmacy, counting out pills and stashing cash in garbage bags. Under their lab coats, the doctors carried guns and it was all legal sort of. American Pain was the brainchild of Chris George, a 27-year-old convicted drug felon. The son of a South Florida home builder, Chris George grew up in ultra-rich Wellington, where Bill Gates, Springsteen, and Madonna kept houses. Thick-necked from weightlifting, he and his twin brother hung out with mobsters, invested in strip clubs, brawled with cops, and grinned for their mug shots. After the housing market stalled, a local doctor clued in the brothers to the burgeoning underground market for lightly regulated prescription painkillers. In Florida, pain clinics could dispense the meds, and no one tracked the patients. Seizing the opportunity, Chris George teamed up with the doctor, and word got out. Just two years later Chris had raked in $40 million, and 90 percent of the pills his doctors prescribed flowed north to feed the rest of the country's insatiable narcotics addiction. Meanwhile, hundreds more pain clinics in the mold of American Pain had popped up in the Sunshine State, creating a gigantic new drug industry. American Pain chronicles the rise and fall of this game-changing pill mill, and how it helped tip the nation into its current opioid crisis, the deadliest drug epidemic in American history. The narrative swings back and forth between Florida and Kentucky, and is populated by a gaudy and diverse cast of characters. This includes the incongruous band of wealthy bad boys, thugs and esteemed physicians who built American Pain, as well as penniless Kentucky clans who transformed themselves into painkiller trafficking rings. It includes addicts whose lives were devastated by American Pain's drugs, and the federal agents and grieving mothers who labored for years to bring the clinic's crew to justice.""",1493007386,9781493007387),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","The Best and the Brightest is David Halberstam's masterpiece, the defining history of the making of the Vietnam tragedy. Using portraits of America's flawed policy makers and accounts of the forces that drove them, The Best and the Brightest reckons magnificently with the most important abiding question of our country's recent history: Why did America become mired in Vietnam and why did it lose? As the definitive single-volume answer to that question, this enthralling book has never been superseded.

","Tessa Gray deveria estar feliz — noivas não são felizes? Entretanto, enquanto ela prepara seu casamento com Jem Carstairs, uma rede de sombras começa a envolver os Caçadores de Sombras do Instituto de Londres. Um novo demônio aparece, um ligado por sangue e segredos a Magister, o homem que planeja usar seu exército de autômatos impiedosos, as Peças Infernais, para destruir os Caçadores de Sombras. Ele precisa só do último item para completar seu plano de destruição. Ele precisa de Tessa. Tessa sabe que Axel Mortmain, o Magister, está vindo atrás dela, mas não imagina quando nem onde ele vai atacar. Charlotte Branwell, o líder do Instituto de Londres, está desesperado para encontrar Mortmain primeiro. E os meninos que têm igual importância no coração de Tessa, Jem e Will, vão fazer qualquer coisa para salvá-la. Embora Tessa e Jem agora estejam comprometidos, e Will soubesse que deveria se esforçar para encontrar outra pessoa com quem se preocupar, ele ainda estava apaixonado por ela, como sempre. Nas últimas palavras ditas por um Caçador de Sombras antes de morrer reside a pista que pode levar Tessa e seus amigos a Mortmain. Mas os Caçadores de Sombras do Instituto de Londres não podem ficar sozinhos, e em sua terra natal, Idris, a Clave duvida de suas alegações de que Mortmain estava chegando. Abandonados por aqueles que deveriam ser seus aliados, e com seus inimigos se aproximando, os Caçadores de Sombras acabam em apuros quando Mortmain rouba o medicamento que está mantendo Jem vivo. Com seu melhor amigo à beira da morte, cabe a Will arriscar tudo para salvar a mulher que os dois amam. A fim de ganhar tempo para Will, o feiticeiro Magnus Bane se junta a Henry Branwell para criar um dispositivo que pode ajudá-los a derrotar o Magister. Como aqueles que amam Tessa estão trabalhando para salvá-la, e o futuro dos Caçadores de Sombras depende dela, Tessa percebeu que a única pessoa que pode salvá-la é ela mesma – para a descoberta de sua própria natureza, Tessa começa a entender que ela é muito mais poderosa do que já mais sonhou ser possível. Mas poderá uma simples garota, mesmo uma que pode comandar o poder dos anjos, derrotar um exército inteiro? Perigo e traição, segredos e encantamentos, os fios emaranhados de amor e perda se entrelaçam quando os Caçadores de Sombras são levados à beira da destruição na conclusão de tirar o fôlego da trilogia As Peças Infernais.",8501092703,9788501092700),Paperback,1ª,400 pages,"

","Acaso sea 'Crónica de una muerte anunciada' la obra más 'realista' de Gabriel García Márquez, pues se basa en un hecho histórico acontecido en la tierra natal del escritor.Cuando empieza la novela, ya se sabe que los hermanos Vicario van a matar a Santiago Nasar -de hecho ya le han matado- para vengar el honor ultrajado de su hermana Ángela, pero el relato termina precisamente en el momento en que Santiago Nasar muere. El tiempo cíclico, tan utilizado por García Márquez en sus obras, reaparece aquí minuciosamente descompuesto en cada uno de sus momentos, reconstruido prolija y exactamente por el narrador, que va dando cuenta de lo que sucedió mucho tiempo atrás, que avanza y retrocede en su relato y hasta llega mucho tiempo después para contar el destino de los supervivientes. La acción es, a un tiempo, colectiva y personal, clara y ambigua, y atrapa al lector desde un principio, a pesar de que conoce el desenlace de la trama. La dialéctica entre mito y realidad se ve potenciada aquí, una vez más, por una prosa tan cargada de fascinación que los eleva hasta las fronteras de la leyenda.",,,Hardcover,,95 pages,"

From the heartbreaking ""Meteor,"" where he struggles for the attention of his wandering mother, to the paranoia of ""Coal""-'Whenever things feel out of control I know the black coal is doing it, and I know what to do, my mom taught me'-to living on the streets of San Francisco in ""Natoma Street,"" JT LeRoy's voice is as lyrical and nuanced as the readers of his acclaimed debut novel Sarah have come to expect. Fresh, raw, and absolutely unforgettable, The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things is sure to establish LeRoy as one of the most compelling voices in contemporary fiction.",1582341427,9781582341422),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","In September 1984, a bomb was planted at the Grand Hotel in the seaside town of Brighton, England, set to explode in twenty-four days when the British prime minister and her entire cabinet would be staying there. High Dive not only takes us inside this audacious assassination attempt—a decisive act of violence on the world stage—but also imagines its way into a group of unforgettable characters. Nimbly weaving together fact and fiction, comedy and tragedy, the story switches among the perspectives of Dan, a young IRA explosives expert; Moose, a former star athlete gone to seed, who is now the deputy hotel manager; and Freya, his teenage daughter, trying to decide what comes after high school. Over the course of a mere four weeks, as the prime minister’s arrival draws closer, each of their lives will be transformed forever. A bold, astonishingly intimate novel of laughter and heartbreak, High Dive is a moving portrait of clashing loyalties, guilt and regret, and how individuals become the grist of history.“Achingly good . . . on a par with Martin Amis.” —The New Yorker""A novel so smart and compassionate and beautifully written that it asks for total immersion."" –Lauren Groff, bestselling author of FATES AND FURIES",1101874597,9781101874592),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Esta edição especial marca os trinta anos de publicação de um dos mais importantes romances surgidos na literatura brasileira no século XX. Viva o povo brasileiro, exuberante e complexa metáfora da formação de nossa identidade nacional, é obra monumental que já nasceu clássica, instaurando novo olhar ficcional sobre o passado do Brasil. A violência física e simbólica, os abismos sociais e os privilégios que os acentuam, a constituição de uma elite autoritária são encenados ao longo desta narrativa polifônica e lírica, muitas vezes irônica, que cobre quatrocentos anos de história. Poucas obras atingiram esse mesmo nível de complexidade, e pouquíssimas alcançaram êxito semelhante ao de Viva o povo brasileiro. Frequentemente, os “romances históricos” brasileiros resvalam para o didatismo maniqueísta ou o exotismo anedótico, mantendo o passado a uma distância segura. Neste romance sob todos os aspectos monumental, João Ubaldo Ribeiro empreende profunda e complexa reflexão sobre a formação da identidade nacional, construindo passagens e personagens que já nasceram clássicos, frutos de sofisticada elaboração literária que se traduz em minuciosa pesquisa de formas e linguagens — nas quais sobejam a ironia, o fantástico, o assombro místico e até certo lirismo. Viva o povo brasileiro é terrivelmente envolvente. Terrivelmente porque o livro encena, sem o menor pudor, a violência física e simbólica inerente à colonização da América portuguesa e, no início do século XIX, à instituição do Estado brasileiro — que, hábil em preservar privilégios e contrastes sociais ainda hoje tão indisfarçáveis, se constitui sobre o mesmo escravismo colonial.",,,Paperback,Edição Especial de 30 Anos,672 pages,"

","Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, the highly acclaimed translators of War and Peace, Doctor Zhivago, and Anna Karenina, which was an Oprah Book Club pick and million-copy bestseller, bring their unmatched talents to The Selected Stories of Anton Chekhov, a collection of thirty of Chekhov’s best tales from the major periods of his creative life.   Considered the greatest short story writer, Anton Chekhov changed the genre itself with his spare, impressionistic depictions of Russian life and the human condition. From characteristically brief, evocative early pieces such as “The Huntsman” and the tour de force “A Boring Story,” to his best-known stories such as “The Lady with the Little Dog” and his own personal favorite, “The Student,” Chekhov’s short fiction possesses the transcendent power of art to awe and change the reader. This monumental edition, expertly translated, is especially faithful to the meaning of Chekhov’s prose and the unique rhythms of his writing, giving readers an authentic sense of his style and a true understanding of his greatness.From the Trade Paperback edition.",8811519667,9788811519669),Paperback,I Grandi Libri - 2 Voll.,1276 pages,"

He wasn't worried about me.For as long as ten-year-old Moon can remember, he has lived out in the forest in a shelter with his father. They keep to themselves, their only contact with other human beings an occasional trip to the nearest general store. When Moon's father dies, Moon follows his father's last instructions: to travel to Alaska to find others like themselves. But Moon is soon caught and entangled in a world he doesn't know or understand, apparent property of the government he has been avoiding all his life. As the spirited and resourceful Moon encounters constables, jails, institutions, lawyers, true friends, and true enemies, he adapts his wilderness survival skills and learns to survive in the outside world, and even, perhaps, make his home there.In this compelling, action-packed book, Watt Key gives us the thrilling coming-of-age story of the unique and extremely appealing Moon.Alabama Moon is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.",0374301840,9780374301842),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Ovo je priča o dvoje buntovnika, Eleonori i Parku, čiji putevi su se ukrstili na čudesan način. Oboje veoma dobro znaju da prva ljubav nikad ne traje večno, ali su dovoljno hrabri i očajni da ipak pokušaju da to i ostvare. Kada Eleonora bude srela Parka, i mi se susrećemo s našim prvim ljubavima i svim teškoćama koje one donose. Ovo je roman o tinejdžerima, ali tema je toliko univerzalna da će svako ko je išao u srednju školu moći da se poistoveti sa našim junacima.Eleonora je nova u kraju, njena razbarušena riđa kosa i pocepana odeća nimalo joj ne pomažu da se uklopi u novu sredinu. Parka će sresti u školskom autobusu. Iako sede zajedno, nikada ne progovaraju ni reč, sve dok Park ne primeti da Eleonora krišom viri u stripove koje je stalno čitao, odudarajući tako od ostalih dečaka opsednutih sportom. Vremenom, stripove okreće sve više ka njoj kako bi i ona mogla da ih čita. Tako počinje njihova ljubavna priča.Polako, veza Eleonore i Parka se razvija, jedno drugom prave kompilacije na kasetama (radnja je smeštena u jednoj školskoj godini, 1986), raspravljaju o herojima iz X-mena, sve dok ne shvate da im je vožnja u školskom autobusu omiljeni deo dana. Ipak, stvari nisu tako jednostavne: Eleonoru maltretiraju druga deca u školi, a kod kuće je čeka još teža situacija u porodici. Parkovim roditeljima se u početku i ne sviđa njegova čudnjikava devojka.Ovo je priča o dvoje ljudi koji se bezgranično vole i koji veruju da mogu prevazići sve prepreke koje im stoje na putu ka sreći.Po ovoj knjizi snima se film u produkciji DreamWorksa. Ekipa koja je zaslužna za filmove kao što su Đavo nosi Pradu i Dnevnik jednog šonjavka, sada radi i na ovom projektu.",867346966X,9788673469669),Paperback,,324 pages,"

","John Scalzi ismét visszatér a Vének háborúja-univerzumba, ahol ezúttal az emberi faj egységének fenntartása a cél.A Föld lakói már tudják, hogy a Gyarmati Szövetség szándékosan eltitkolta előlük az univerzum veszélyeit. Generációk óta védelmezik az anyabolygót különféle idegen fajokkal szemben, ám nem puszta hazafiasságból: mindennél jobban szükségük van a katonai utánpótlásra, amivel egyedül a Föld láthatja el őket. A “Perry-incidens” után azonban nincsenek többé titkok, ráadásul új fajok jelentek meg és alkottak egységet – kifejezetten a Gyarmati Szövetség ellen. Tagjaik közt szeretnék látni a Földet is, amelynek vezetői elárulva érzik magukat, és már nem tudják, hogy kiben bízhatnak. De választaniuk kell.Eközben a Gyarmati Szövetség működése is veszélybe kerül. Haderejük bevetése helyett ezúttal diplomáciai cselekkel és politikai fondorlatokkal akarják a javukra fordítani ezt az ördögi játszmát, amelynek a tétje most már az egész emberiség jövője. Bevetik tehát a B csapatot Harry Wilson hadnaggyal az élen. Azt a csapatot, amelyik talán a harctéren nem a legjobb választás, de a váratlan és kiszámíthatatlan helyzetekre mindig váratlan és kiszámíthatatlan megoldásokat találnak. Az ő küldetéseikről szól A lázadás hangjai.John Scalzi először digitálisan, epizódok formájában publikálta a kötetben szereplő történeteket 2013. januárja és áprilisa között, majd a kirobbanó sikernek köszönhetően nem kellett sokáig várni a könyv formájú megjelenésre sem. Elképesztő epizódjaival, felejthetetlen szereplőivel és emlékezetes párbeszédeivel A lázadás hangjai a Vének háborúja-sorozat legszínesebb, legváltozatosabb darabja.",,,Paperback,,464 pages,"

","Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die there.After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills—and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit—he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?",0804139032,9780804139038),ebook,,370 pages,"

","The final book in the Quest series is ‘Quest in the Caribbean’. Wendy and I have become full time sailors. The sea has been kind to us. It has been our home, a very strict master and unforgiving teacher. We slowly learned our lessons of seamanship one day at a time. But more importantly we learned a great deal about each other and what it takes to be good companions on a tiny boat. ‘Quest for the Caribbean’ begins on a beautiful day in the British Virgin Islands. When we pass through the dangerous, narrow, reef-strewn passage in Virgin Gorda and enter the Caribbean we are one boat length closer to fulfilling our dream. There are many more islands to explore and miles to sail before the journey is complete. Some of the wonders that await our eager eyes are Saba, the fabled ‘island in the clouds’ and the neighboring island of Statia. The serenely beautiful island of Nevis, Montserrat’s volcanoes, the gentle people of Dominica, Saint Lucia and the Grenadines all enrich our lives. ‘Quest for the Caribbean’ ends on the south shore of Grenada as we are about to fulfill a destiny that was many hard years in the making.",,,Kindle Edition,,228 pages,"

En un batallón disciplinario, las conversaciones y las canciones están, naturalmente, prohibidas; individuos de cuarta categoría no pueden aspirar a los privilegios del soldado alemán.

En menos de un cuarto de hora estábamos cubiertos de sudor, nuestros pies empezaban a calentarse y abríamos la boca para poder respirar, pues la nariz por sí sola resultaba rápidamente incapaz de suministrarnos una cantidad de oxígeno suficiente.

It is a metaphysical, psychological, action/adventure, myth and magic, tragic romance, medieval warfare, fantasy, historical fiction novel.“Voices of the Stars” is the true, in-depth, eye-witness chronicle of the world of the King, Arthur, and his compatriots of his Alliance of the 5 distinct cultures living on “These Our Fair Isles”: the original Old Dark Tribes, the Celtic Clans, the Roman-styled Britons, the Picti and the original, ‘legal’ Saxons, whose land was obtained through barter with Vortigern. It is also the real story of Arthur and Morgan’s tragic, Star-crossed love for one another, the devoted loyalty of their brother of the heart, Bedwyr, the strength of their mother, Igraine, Great Seer of the Old Dark Tribes, the treachery of their other sister Morganna le Faye, and the never before told story of the only child of Arthur’s blood, Mordred.Woven into the rich Dark Age tapestry of this magnificently complex, emotionally charged novel – the first in its series – are the Old Ways, The Old Gods, the Great Goddess and the Goddesses Nine, Magic, Seers, Enchantresses, Druids, Dragons, Ancient Rituals, medieval warfare, and the Leonardo DaVinci of his day - Gwyddion, the Merlin. It is filled with intrigue, passion, treachery, love, and with Epic Poetry throughout. It follows this evocative tale through five generations and is an intricately involved work with many legendary, historical and original characters.These now revealed histories debunk the cliché flights of fancy that have attached themselves to Arthurian legend in the intervening centuries - both in Renaissance and modern tellings, going back to post Roman days of the Cymru, the pre-Welsh clans.“Voices of the Stars” is the story of how Arthur’s sister, Morgan of the Woods, realizing the import of her time, bids all of her brother Arthur’s close allies, kith, and kin to write their “histories” – their autobiographies – as their lives unfold. All events – such as battles – are seen and written from the differing perspective of each contributor. We come to know the truth of “Voices’” characters - their joys, tragedies, hopes, dreams, ambitions, accomplishments, failures, desires, fears, loves, and hatreds are written into their stories. Tricks of the Fates abound throughout their lives as each comes to accept their shadow selves, weaknesses, flaws, hidden desires, strengths and goodness.These histories are to be secreted away for the sake of posterity. Why? To put it into Morgan’s words:“What lies within these vellum pages is an history... which I, Morgan, have compiled to preserve the truth of these matters - because, it is a fact that legends of the simple folk, as well as songs and poems of the Bards, gallop into fancy like Warhorses to the smell of blood. What begins as a simple pattern, weaves, entwines and spreads like the gossamer threads of Arachne –ultimately and forever changing the meaning of events as they truly were.”Within its pages the Cosmic Mysteries are revealed and taught through an original and complete spiritual Mystery System of the Great Aixia and the “Goddesses Nine” – replete with ancient Gods, Myths, Seasonal Rites, Moon Rituals, chants and secret initiations of The Order on The Isle of Apples.",,,ebook,,,"

","In 1989, the memorable year when the Wall came down, a university student in Berlin on his early morning run finds a corpse lying on a park bench and alerts the authorities. This classic police-procedural scene opens an extraordinary novel, a masterwork that traces the fate of myriad Europeans - Hungarians, Jews, Germans, Gypsies - across the treacherous years of the mid-twentieth century. The social and political circumstances of their lives may vary richly, their sexual and spiritual longings may seem to each of them entirely unique, yet Peter N das's magnificent tapestry unveils uncanny, reverberating parallels that link them across time and space.Three unusual men are at the heart of Parallel Stories: Hans von Wolkenstein, whose German mother is linked to dark secrets of fascist-Nazi collaboration during the 1940s, Agost Lippay-Lehr, whose influential father has served Hungary's different political regimes for decades, and Andras Rott, who has his own dark record of dark activities abroad. They are friends in Budapest when we eventually meet them in the spring of 1961, a pivotal time in the postwar epoch and in their clandestine careers. But the richly detailed, dramatic memories and actions of these men, like those of their friends, lovers and family members, range from Berlin and Moscow to Switzerland and Holland, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, and of course, across Hungary. The ever-daring, ever-original episodes of Parallel Lives explore the most intimate, most difficult human experiences in a prose glowing with uncommon clarity and also with mysterious uncertainty - as is characteristic of Nadas's subtle, spirited art.The web of extended dramas in Parallel Stories reaches not just forward to the transformative year of 1989 but back to the spring of 1939, with Europe trembling on the edge of war; to the bestial times of 1944-45, when Budapest was besieged, the final solution devastated Hungary's Jews, and the war came to an end; and to the cataclysmic Hungarian Revolution of October 1956. But there is much more to Parallel Stories than that: it is a daring, demanding, and very moving exploration of humanity at its most constrained and its most free.",1250013909,9781250013903),Paperback,,1133 pages,"

","Alex ha quindici anni. La malattia della madre lo costringe a lasciare la sua tranquilla cittadina californiana per seguire l'eccentrica nonna Kate, reporter di professione, in una spedizione nel cuore dell'Amazzonia finanziata dalla prestigiosa rivista ""International Geographic"". Bisogna cercare una Bestia mostruosa e gigantesca che, con il suo odore, paralizza chi la incontra. Alex si trova così ad affrontare eventi e situazioni eccezionali: dalle banali punture degli insetti, all'incontro con animali feroci e creature magnetiche come il giaguaro (con cui Alex subito si identifica). Nel gruppo della spedizione c'è anche Nadia, la figlia tredicenne della guida. La madre è inglese ma lei è nata nella foresta e si muove in perfetta armonia nella natura selvaggia. Sa tante cose e Alex con lei si sente più sicuro. I due ragazzi sono inseparabili e le loro avventure diventano incalzanti: incontrano spiriti e sciamani, scoprono che alcuni membri della spedizione vogliono sterminare gli indios, cadono in balia del Popolo della Nebbia, assumono strani poteri e sensibilità... Lei diventa Aquila, lui Giaguaro. Riescono a scoprire il mistero della Bestia e a salvare gli indigeni, ma anche a conoscersi meglio. L'atmosfera mescola la percezione magica alla sceneggiatura naturalistica: il fiume, la foresta, la montagna fanno parte di una geografia esatta e insieme straordinaria. La loro esperienza è meravigliosa ma al tempo stesso reale e riflette il cammino interiore di un essere umano. Alex è davvero un ragazzo qualunque e il lettore può provare un fortissimo senso di identificazione. La sua avventura contiene un denso nucleo etico: la lotta contro il male non è solo contro chi vuole distruggere l'Amazzonia. È anche contro una percezione di sé limitata ed egoistica che alimenta debolezze, timori e insicurezze.",8807420953,9788807420955),Paperback,,242 pages,"

","From Publishers WeeklyThis impressive doorstopper of a book is like a family historical saga, except that the family is the American intelligence community. It has all the appropriate characters and tracks them over 40 years: a rogue uncle, the Sorcerer, a heavy-drinking chief of the Berlin office in the early Cold War days; a dashing hero, Jack McAuliffe, who ages gracefully and never loses his edge; a dastardly turncoat, who for the sake of the reader will not be identified here, but who dies nobly; a dark genius, the real-life James Jesus Angleton, who after the disclosure that an old buddy, British spy Kim Philby, had been a Russian agent all along, became a model of paranoia; a Russian exchange student who starts out with our heroes at Yale but then works for ""the other side""; and endless assorted ladyfolk, wives, girlfriends and gutsy daughters who are not portrayed with anything like the gritty relish of the men. Littell, an old hand at the genre (he wrote the classic 'The Defection of A.J. Lewinter') keeps it all moving well, and there are convincing set pieces: the fall of Budapest, the Bay of Pigs invasion in Cuba and an eerily prescient episode in Afghanistan, in which a character obviously modeled on Osama bin Laden appears, accompanied by a sidekick whose duty is to slay him instantly if his capture by the West seems imminent. It's gung-ho, hard-drinking, table-turning fun, even if a little old-fashioned now that we have so many other problems to worry about than the Russians but it brings back vividly a time when they seemed a real threat. There are some breathtaking real-life moments with the Kennedy brothers, and with a bumbling Reagan, and with Vladimir Putin, now the leader of Russia, who is here given a background that is extremely shady. (Apr.)Forecast: The Afghanistan element will lend itself to handselling, but that will be only icing on the cake of Overlook's full-tilt publicity campaign, which will include national ad/promo, a TV/radio satellite tour and an author tour. Along with Littell's reputation among critics and spy-lit cognescenti, it should all add up to a breakout book with serious bestseller potential. And Overlook's planned reprinting in hardcover of all of Littell's work, beginning with 'The Defection of A.J. Lewinter,' should keep Littell's name in readers' minds for years to come.",0142002623,9780142002629),Paperback,,894 pages,"

The girl has returned to her aunt to take refuge and begins to describe her journey: ""There were piles of bodies and if you stopped to find out there was one killed by coffee or one killed by pins, they were killed by heroin, petrol, chainsaws, hairspray, bleach, foxgloves, the smell of smoke was where we were burning the grass that wouldn't serve...""""Chilling...

Churchill is that rare dramatist who imagines different forms and even invented languages every time out."" - Chicago Tribune""Deeply disturbing. Far Away has the picturesque form and gentle rhythms of a fairy tale told at bedtime. But it also finds a grating alarm in traditional sounds of comfort, from the lapping of a stream and the lilt of a lullaby to the hesitating confidences exchanged by a boy and girl falling in love… I can think of no contemporary playwright who combines such scope of imagination and depth of purpose."" - Ben Brantley, New York Times",1559361999,9781559361996),Paperback,,64 pages,"

","The international literary sensation-a runaway bestseller in Spain, rights sold in more than 20 countries-about a boy's quest through the secrets and shadows of postwar Barcelona for a mysterious author whose book has proved as dangerous to own as it is impossible to forget.  Barcelona, 1945-just after the war, a great world city lies in shadow, nursing its wounds, and a boy named Daniel awakes on his eleventh birthday to find that he can no longer remember his mother's face. To console his only child, Daniel's widowed father, an antiquarian book dealer, initiates him into the secret of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a library tended by Barcelona's guild of rare-book dealers as a repository for books forgotten by the world, waiting for someone who will care about them again. Daniel's father coaxes him to choose a volume from the spiraling labyrinth of shelves, one that, it is said, will have a special meaning for him. And Daniel so loves the novel he selects, The Shadow of the Wind by one Julian Carax, that he sets out to find the rest of Carax's work. To his shock, he discovers that someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book this author has written. In fact, he may have the last one in existence. Before Daniel knows it his seemingly innocent quest has opened a door into one of Barcelona's darkest secrets, an epic story of murder, magic, madness and doomed love. And before long he realizes that if he doesn't find out the truth about Julian Carax, he and those closest to him will suffer horribly.",0753819317,9780753819319),Paperback,Trade Paperback.  11th impression.,403 pages,"

","When, on the eve of the Second World War, Nazim Hikmet (1902-1963) -- Turkey's most acclaimed and popular poet -- was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison for his Communist beliefs, he embarked on the writing of his epic, Human Landscapes from My Country. This 17,000-line verse-novel is made up of a traveler's vivid encounters with Turkish men and women from all walks of life. In colloquial language, Hikmet stages their private hopes and griefs, and through these many human dramas, he documents Turkey's historic transformation into a secular republic. Human Landscapes from My Country is ""lively . . . cinematographic . . .

","In Eleganta Ariciului „sunt doua eroine: o fetita precoce si o portareasa care-si ascunde bine jocul, incearcand sa lase impresia ca e doar o portareasa, ea fiind de fapt foarte citita, foarte erudita si foarte fina.Sunt doua singuratati care, pe masura ce in cladirea in care locuiesc se petrec anumite evenimente, ies incetul cu incetul din singuratate, se schimba, se transforma, renasc. Vor trai o gramada de transformari interioare. De indata ce am spus asta, mi se pare un pic superficial. De fapt, cand scriu, nu o fac ca sa spun o poveste, chiar daca, la capat, ea insasi se povesteste. Scriu pentru placerea cuvintelor si a stilului; imi place mult sa simt asta scriind texte si, in plus, sa incerc de fiecare data placerea unica de a scrie, intr-un mod cat mai potrivit si cat mai pur posibil, sper eu, ceea ce resimt.Pe de alta parte, povestea si scriitura sunt pentru mine mijloace de a evoca lucruri care ma intereseaza si lucruri pe care le iubesc. L-am auzit pe cineastul Jeunet, referitor la Fabulosul destin al lui Amelie Poulain explicand ca, ani de zile, notase intr-un carnetel tot ceea ce il interesa si tot ceea ce ii placea in ideea ca intr-o zi sa le transpuna intr-un film. Si astfel a aparut Amelie Poulain.Acest roman este, intr-o oarecare masura, acelasi lucru, adica mi-a facut enorma placere ca, prin vocile celor doua eroine, sa-mi transcriu iubirea pentru placerile cotidiene, pentru arta, pentru Japonia, pentru anumite fiinte, pentru intalnirea dintre aceste fiinte, pentru unele emotii estetice. Mi se pare ca asta mi-a facut cea mai mare placere si e ceea ce ma interesa cel mai mult. Va doresc lectura placuta. In orice caz, sper asta. La revedere si pe curand.” Muriel BarberyCover illustration: Ágnes Keszeg",,,Paperback,,351 pages,"

","A brilliant example of the comparative method,The Gift presents the first systematic study of the custom—widespread in primitive societies from ancient Rome to present-day Melanesia—of exchanging gifts. The gift is a perfect example of what Mauss calls a total social phenomenon, since it involves legal, economic, moral, religious, aesthetic, and other dimensions. He sees the gift exchange as related to individuals and groups as much as to the objects themselves, and his analysis calls into question the social conventions and economic systems that had been taken for granted for so many years. In a modern translation, introduced by distinguished anthropologist Mary Douglas, The Gift is essential reading for students of social anthropology and sociology.",039332043X,9780393320435),Paperback,,184 pages,"

So tutto: i modelli, le scuderie, i piloti, le stagioni… Me lo ha insegnato Denny.Denny è come un fratello per me. Per sbarcare il lunario lavora in un’autofficina, ma in realtà è un pilota automobilistico, un asso, anche se per ora siamo in pochi a saperlo.

","Dear Person-Holding-This,I guess you must've found my letter. Well, when you read it, keep in mind that passing Mrs. Tweedy's English class is hard enough. But when the fate of the world suddenly rests on your shoulders, it's difficult to focus on school. I wish I'd handled things better, but when I saw my first death-specter foretelling my best friend's death, I freaked out.Of course, I didn't exactly sign up to be a Hand of Fate or to protect King Arthur's Last Descendant. I know it isn't my fault Vivienne le Mort and Morgan le Faye decided to toy with fate all those centuries ago, but I do blame myself for what happened in Crabapple.

","Moving from the Paleolithic age to the present, Karen Armstrong details the great lengths to which humankind has gone in order to experience a sacred reality that it called by many names, such as God, Brahman, Nirvana, Allah, or Dao. Focusing especially on Christianity but including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Chinese spiritualities, Armstrong examines the diminished impulse toward religion in our own time, when a significant number of people either want nothing to do with God or question the efficacy of faith. Why has God become unbelievable? Why is it that atheists and theists alike now think and speak about God in a way that veers so profoundly from the thinking of our ancestors?Answering these questions with the same depth of knowledge and profound insight that have marked all her acclaimed books, Armstrong makes clear how the changing face of the world has necessarily changed the importance of religion at both the societal and the individual level. And she makes a powerful, convincing argument for drawing on the insights of the past in order to build a faith that speaks to the needs of our dangerously polarized age. Yet she cautions us that religion was never supposed to provide answers that lie within the competence of human reason; that, she says, is the role of logos. The task of religion is “to help us live creatively, peacefully, and even joyously with realities for which there are no easy explanations.” She emphasizes, too, that religion will not work automatically. It is, she says, a practical discipline: its insights are derived not from abstract speculation but from “dedicated intellectual endeavor” and a “compassionate lifestyle that enables us to break out of the prism of selfhood.”",0307269183,9780307269188),Hardcover,,406 pages,"

But Riley has a secret…all that sexy talk? Not an ounce of it comes from personal experience. Her own bedroom escapades are more limited than even her best friends know. When her editor requests that all columnists write something more personal for Stiletto’s anniversary issue, Riley turns to the one man she’s always been able to count on and calls in the favor of a lifetime.Sam Compton would do anything for Riley McKenna. Anything except be her experimental sex toy. He refuses her request. At least until she tells him that it’ll either be him or she’ll go to someone else. And that, Sam can’t accept. Reluctantly he agrees to her terms—one night of completely meaningless sex in the name of research. Riley thinks she’s prepared for what awaits her in Sam’s bed. After ten years of writing about sex, actually doing it shouldn’t be that different, right? So wrong. What starts as “one time only” becomes “just one more time.” And then one more.

What would they do if aliens contacted you? Maybe they'd hide you -- keep you quarantined under armed guard -- to keep you from telling the truth, There is a law on the books right now which gives the government the right to do exactly that! Does that sound like the government doesn't take ETs seriously? Can you handle the truth? If you're ready for the book that blows the lid off this UFO cover-up and breaks open a ""Cosmic Watergate,"" you must read ""Extra-Terrestrials Among Us"" by George C. Andrews. The revelations in this book are going to shock you. The author researched the evidence for ET intervention in human affairs for more than a decade before presenting his startling conclusions in ""Extra-Terrestrials Among Us."" The result is an exciting challenge to ""orthodox"" thinking and the die-hard skeptics. It will broaden your perception about the world we really live in. In ""Extra-Terrestrials Among Us ""you will discover documented case histories of: -Cattle mutilations -Impossible lights in the sky -Circular flying machines -Strange disappearances -Weird objects falling from the sky -Spontaneous human combustion The result will lead you to the only conclusion possible, we are not alone!

","'I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death,' John Keats soberly prophesied in 1818 as he started writing the blankverse epic Hyperion. Today he endures as the archetypal Romantic genius who explored the limits of the imagination and celebrated the pleasures of the senses but suffered a tragic early death. Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance Endymion; and the five-act poetic tragedy Otho the Great. Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language. 'No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perception of loveliness,' said Matthew Arnold. 'In the faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in what we call natural magic, he ranks with Shakespeare.'",,,,3rd,754 pages,"

L'ingresso nelle scuole superiori lo lancia in un vortice di prime volte: la prima festa, la prima rissa, il primo amore - per la bellissima ragazza con gli occhi verdi che quando lo guarda fa tremare il mondo. Il primo bacio, e lei gli dice: per te sono troppo grande, però possiamo essere amici.Per compensare, Charlie trova una che non gli piace e parla troppo: a sedici anni fa il primo sesso, e non sa neanche perché. Allora lui, più portato alla riflessione che all'azione, affida emozioni, trasgressioni e turbamenti a una lunga serie di lettere indirizzate a un amico, al quale racconta ciò che vive, che sente, che ha intorno.Dotato di un'innata gentilezza d'animo e di un dono speciale per la poesia, il ragazzo è il confidente perfetto di tutti, quello che non dimentica mai un compleanno, quello che non tradisce mai e poi mai un segreto.

","A masterful tale of ambition, jealousy, desire, and superpowers.Victor and Eli started out as college roommates—brilliant, arrogant, lonely boys who recognized the same sharpness and ambition in each other. In their senior year, a shared research interest in adrenaline, near-death experiences, and seemingly supernatural events reveals an intriguing possibility: that under the right conditions, someone could develop extraordinary abilities. But when their thesis moves from the academic to the experimental, things go horribly wrong.Ten years later, Victor breaks out of prison, determined to catch up to his old friend (now foe), aided by a young girl whose reserved nature obscures a stunning ability. Meanwhile, Eli is on a mission to eradicate every other super-powered person that he can find—aside from his sidekick, an enigmatic woman with an unbreakable will. Armed with terrible power on both sides, driven by the memory of betrayal and loss, the archnemeses have set a course for revenge—but who will be left alive at the end?In Vicious, V. E. Schwab brings to life a gritty comic-book-style world in vivid prose: a world where gaining superpowers doesn't automatically lead to heroism, and a time when allegiances are called into question.Listening Length: 9 hours and 55 minutes",,,Kindle Edition,,366 pages,"

Telling the story of her family, growing up in California in the '60s and '70s, her life in visual art, her move to New York City, the men in her life, her marriage, her relationship with her daughter, her music, and her band, Girl in a Band is a rich and beautifully written memoir.Gordon takes us back to the lost New York of the 1980s and '90s that gave rise to Sonic Youth, and the Alternative revolution in popular music. The band helped build a vocabulary of music—paving the way for Nirvana, Hole, Smashing Pumpkins and many other acts. But at its core, Girl in a Band examines the route from girl to woman in uncharted territory, music, art career, what partnership means—and what happens when that identity dissolves.Evocative and edgy, filled with the sights and sounds of a changing world and a transformative life, Girl in a Band is the fascinating chronicle of a remarkable journey and an extraordinary artist.",0062295896,9780062295897),Hardcover,First Edition (U.S.),273 pages,"

","'Oh, why, dear God, did I marry him?'Emma Bovary is beautiful and bored, trapped in her marriage to a mediocre doctor and stifled by the banality of provincial life. An ardent devourer of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.'",,,Kindle Edition,,286 pages,"

","Robert Coles first met Dorothy Day over thirty-five years ago when, as a medical student, he worked in one of her Catholic Worker soup kitchens. He remained close to this inspiring and controversial woman until her death in 1980. His book, an intellectual and psychological portrait, confronts candidly the central puzzles of her life: the sophisticated Greenwich Village novelist and reporter who converted to Catholicism; the single mother who raised her child in a most unorthodox ""family""; her struggles with sexuality, loneliness, and pride; her devout religious conservatism coupled with radical politics. This intense portrait is based on many years of conversation and correspondence, as well as tape-recorded interviews.",0201079747,9780201079746),Paperback,,206 pages,"

","Sylvain Tesson, pour rassasier son besoin de liberté, a trouvé une solution radicale et vieille comme les expériences des ermites de la vieille Russie : s’enfermer seul dans une cabane en pleine taïga sibérienne, sur les bords du Baïkal, pendant six mois. De février à juillet 2010, il a choisi de faire l’expérience du silence, de la solitude, et du froid. Sa cabane, construite par des géologues soviétiques dans les années brejnéviennes, est un cube de rondins de trois mètres sur trois, chauffé par un poêle en fonte, à six jours de marche du premier village et à des centaines de kilomètres d’une piste. Vivre isolé du monde nécessite avant tout de s’imposer un rythme. Le matin, Sylvain Tesson lit, écrit, fume, ou dessine. Puis ce sont cinq longues heures consacrées à la vie domestique : il faut couper le bois, déblayer la neige, préparer les lignes de pêche, réparer les avanies de l’hiver… Le défi de six mois d’ermitage, c’est de savoir si l’on réussira à se supporter. En cas de dégoût de soi, nulle épaule où s’appuyer, nul visage pour se lustrer les yeux. L’inspecteur forestierChabourov qui l’a déposé sur cette grève le premier jour le savait. Il lui a glissé, énigmatique, en se touchant la tempe : « Ici, c’est un magnifique endroit pour se suicider ». La solitude finira par se révéler fertile : quand on n’a personne à qui exposer ses pensées, la feuille de papier est un confident précieux ; le carnet de note, un compagnon poli. C’est ce journal que nous offre à lire Sylvain Tesson. En notant minutieusement, presque quotidiennement, ses impressions face au silence, ses luttes pour survivre dans une nature hostile, ses désespoirs, ses doutes, mais aussi, ses moments d’extase, de paix intérieure et d’osmose avec la nature, Sylvain Tesson nous fait partager une expérience hors du commun. Finalement « la vie en cabane apprend à peupler l’instant, à ne rien attendre de l’avenir et à accepter ce qui advient comme une fête. Le génie du lieu aide à apprivoiser le temps ». Une expérience comme seule la littérature peut la ressaisir afin qu’elle ne soit pas seulement une aventure isolée, mais une aventure exceptionnelle à la portée de tous.",207012925X,9782070129256),Paperback,Collection Blanche,271 pages,"

Dollar is out of college but aimless, when he takes a job with Global Pork Rind -- his task to locate big spreads of land in the Texas and Oklahoma panahandles that can be purchased by the corporation and converted to hog farms.

Dollar settles into LaVon Fronk's old bunkhouse for fifty dollars a month, helps out at Cy Frease's Old Dog Café, targets Ace and Tater Crouch's ranch for Global Pork, and learns the hard way how vigorously the old owners will hold on to their land, even though their children want no part of it.",0753169428,9780753169421),Paperback,,412 pages,"

","Goethes ‘Faust’ ist das Menschheitsdrama par excellence: Die ungeheuerliche Suche nach dem, was die Welt im Innersten zusammenhält, führt auch den Gelehrtesten an die Grenzen des Verstandes. In ‘Der Tragödie zweitem Teil’ (1832) verdichtet sich diese Suche zum Streben nach dem universellen, unverbrüchlichen Bündnis von Leben und Kunst. Bis heute besticht der ‘Faust’ durch seine fulminante Kraft und Tiefe und seinen Reichtum an Bezügen. Zu Recht gilt die Tragödie als das bedeutendste Werk der deutschen Literatur.",3866477740,9783866477742),Hardcover,,413 pages,"

","Quello che si incontra comunemente, negli studi odierni sulla filosofia greca, è il tentativo di restituire contenuti remotissimi da noi con gli strumenti più moderni, condizionati dalle formule e dai metodi odierni della ricerca storica, in breve con il linguaggio filologico. Qui invece Giorgio Colli prova a far riemergere il periodo culminante della Grecia – il settimo, il sesto, il quinto secolo a.C. –, il più lontano da noi e dalla nostra comprensione, senza suggerire approcci specialistici. L’accessibilità del suo modo di esporre è raggiunta mediante un’inversione di prospettiva: non sono gli occhi del presente a guardare quei secoli, rimpiccioliti dalla grande distanza, e neppure gli occhi del quarto secolo a.C., di Aristotele, ma al contrario si tenta di evocare uno sguardo «alle spalle» di quei secoli, uno sguardo gettato dagli dèi omerici e pre-omerici. In questo spingersi all’indietro, verso un’antichità dal profilo incerto, l’origine della filosofia greca, questo evento misterioso, non è ricacciata in un passato più lontano, ma viene riportata al contrario a un’epoca assai posteriore, è un prodotto mediato che si lega al nome di Platone. Prima c’è l’età dei sapienti. Quando nasce la filosofia, la parabola dell’eccellenza greca ha già iniziato il suo declino. E questa crisi decisiva è anteriore anche a Euripide e a Socrate, è una frattura, un indebolimento che sono interni al mondo dei sapienti, che solo attraverso questo si decifrano.",8845901815,9788845901812),Paperback,Piccola Biblioteca #29,116 pages,"

","Manabu Yukawa, the physicist known as ""Detective Galileo,"" has traveled to Hari Cove, a once-popular summer resort town that has fallen on hard times. He is there to speak at a conference on a planned underwater mining operation, which has sharply divided the town. One faction is against the proposed operation, concerned about the environmental impact on the area, known for its pristine waters. The other faction, seeing no future in the town as it is, believes its only hope lies in the development project.The night after the tense panel discussion, one of the resort's guests is found dead on the seashore at the base of the local cliffs. The local police at first believe it was a simple accident-that he wandered over the edge while walking on unfamiliar territory in the middle of the night. But when they discover that the victim was a former policeman and that the cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning, they begin to suspect he was murdered, and his body tossed off the cliff to misdirect the police.As the police try to uncover where Tsukahara was killed and why, Yukawa finds himself enmeshed in yet another confounding case of murder. In a series of twists as complex and surprising as any in Higashino's brilliant, critically acclaimed work, Galileo uncovers the hidden relationship behind the tragic events that led to this murder.",1250027926,9781250027924),Hardcover,,358 pages,"

Anne is a charming single mom running her own small pizzeria. She is exactly that disastrous type – lost among due tax reports; a 4-year-old kid running and messing everything in the kitchen and spilling flour on the customers; last but not least - personal finances never making the ends meet. Nate believes he can cope with a kid and a business that is seemingly on the verge of collapse. What he for sure will not handle is finding out his woman is also into music. He’d prefer to see a legion of men in Anne’s bedroom instead of that old acoustic guitar. Will he be selfish enough to break her dreams for the sake of his own personal happiness or will he find the courage to support her and maybe find that there is music in his soul?,,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Adrian Mole faces the same agonies which life sets before most adolescents: troubles with girls, school, parents, and an uncaring world. The difference, though, between young Master Mole and his peers is that this British lad keeps a diary -- an earnest chronicle of longing and disaster. From Adrian's obsession with intellectuality after understanding ""nearly every word"" of a Malcolm Muggeridge broadcast to his anguished adoration of a lovely, mercurial schoolmate, from his view of his parents' constantly creaking relationship to his heartfelt but hilarious attempts at cathartic verse, here is a triumph of deadpan satire. ABBA, Princess Di's wedding, street punks, Monty Python, the Falklands campaign -- all the cultural pageantry of a keenly observed era marches past the unique perspective of A. Mole, the unforgettable lad whose self-absorption only gets funnier as his life becomes more desperate.",0413588106,9780413588104),Paperback,,203 pages,"

","Sir Gareth Ludlow was a sought-after bachelor in London high society -- wealthy, noble, handsome... and brokenhearted since the death of his true love many years ago. Resigned to remarry, Sir Gareth decides to request the hand of a woman he respects and admires -- Lady Hester Thealer. But fate takes an impish turn when, en route to propose to his sensible acquaintance Lady Hester, Ludlow finds a saucy young lady who identifies herself as ""Amanda Smith."" Pretty Amanda is alone and unchaperone, and wandering unattended, and Ludlow, whose interest in her was purely avuncular, knows it is his duty to bring her back to her family. But it is to prove no easy task for the Corinthian. This turns out to be a challenge as Amanda seems to possess an imagination as intriguing as it is dangerous. Finally, resigned Sir Gareth Ludlow arrives at the Theale estate with the runaway schoolgirl in tow. After his proposal, Lady Hester stuns both him and her family when she refuses him. At her age, no one would expect her to turn down such an eligible suitor. But rational Hester has met the beautiful indomitable Amanda. How can the quiet, shy Hester hope to compete with such a lively young lady? The headstrong Amanda is young--but old enough to know her own romantic mind--Amanda ran away from her doting grandfather, who objected to her proposed marriage to a youthful, impecunious officer. And the young Amanda will be who will show Hester how to win Ludlow's elusive heart.",0099476355,9780099476351),Paperback,,268 pages,"

They spent two short but unforgettable years together, full of lust and killing and the darkest kind of love that two people can share.And then Seraphina was gone.It’s been six years since Fredrik’s lover and sadistic partner in crime turned his world upside-down. Seraphina went into hiding and has eluded him ever since. Now, he’s getting closer to finding her, and an innocent woman named Cassia is the key to drawing Seraphina from the shadows. But Cassia—after sustaining injuries from a fire that Seraphina ignited—suffers from amnesia and can’t give Fredrik the information he desperately seeks. Having no other choice, Fredrik has been keeping Cassia locked in his basement as he not only tries to get her to recall her past—because she and Seraphina share it—but also to protect her from Seraphina, who clearly wants her dead.But Cassia is a light in the darkness that Fredrik never believed existed. After a year subjected to her kindness and compassion, he finds himself struggling with his love for Seraphina, and his growing feelings for Cassia—because he knows that to love one, the other must die.Will light win out over darkness, or will something more powerful than either further destroy an already tortured soul?

Durden alkaa järjestää baarien kellareissa salaisia tappeluklubeja, joissa virkamiehet, tarjoilijat ja tietokonemyyjät hakkaavat toisiaan henkensä kaupalla.Durdenin johdatuksella miehet alkavat toteuttaa mitä mutkikkaimpia operaatioita normiyhteiskunnan suistamiseksi raiteiltaan. Romaanin vauhti kiihtyy samaa tahtia kuin Durdenin anarkistinen amokjuoksu, ja ovelat käänteet harhauttavat terävimmänkin lukijan teoksen edetessä kohti apokalyptistä loppuaan.",9524716941,9524716941,Hardcover,,233 pages,"

","The author of Song of Solomon now sets her extraordinary novelistic powers on a striking new course. Tar Baby, audacious and hypnotic, is masterful in its mingling of tones--of longing and alarm, of urbanity and a primal, mythic force in which the landscape itself becomes animate, alive with a wild, dark complicity in the fates of the people whose drama unfolds. It is a novel suffused with a tense and passionate inquiry, revealing a whole spectrum of emotions underlying the relationships between black men and women, white men and women, and black and white people.The place is a Caribbean island. In their mansion overlooking the sea, the cultivated millionaire Valerian Street, now retired, and his pretty, younger wife, Margaret, go through rituals of living, as if in a trance. It is the black servant couple, who have been with the Streets for years--the fastidious butler, Sydney, and his strong yet remote wife--who have arranged every detail of existence to create a surface calm broken only by sudden bursts of verbal sparring between Valerian and his wife. And there is a visitor among them--a beautiful young black woman, Jadine, who is not only the servant's dazzling niece, but the protegée and friend of the Streets themselves; Jadine, who has been educated at the Sorbonne at Valerian's expense and is home now for a respite from her Paris world of fashion, film and art.Through a season of untroubled ease, the lives of these five move with a ritualized grace until, one night, a ragged, starving black American street man breaks into the house. And, in a single moment, with Valerian's perverse decision not to call for help but instead to invite the man to sit with them and eat, everything changes. Valerian moves toward a larger abdication. Margaret's delicate and enduring deception is shattered. The butler and his wife are forced into acknowledging their illusions. And Jadine, who at first is repelled by the intruder, finds herself moving inexorably toward him--he calls himself Son;  he is a kind of black man she has dreaded since childhood; uneducated, violent, contemptuous of her privilege. As Jadine and Son come together in the loving collision they have both welcomed and feared, the novel moves outward--to the Florida backwater town Son was raised in, fled from, yet cherishes; to her sleek New York; then back to the island people and their protective and entangling legends. As the lovers strive to hold and understand each other, as they experience the awful weight of  the separate worlds that have formed them--she perceiving his vision of reality and of love as inimical to her freedom, he perceiving her as the classic lure, the tar baby set out to entrap him--all the mysterious elements, all the highly charged threads of the story converge. Everything that is at risk is made clear: how the conflicts and dramas wrought by social and cultural circumstances must ultimately be played out in the realm of the heart.Once again, Toni Morrison has given us a novel of daring, fascination, and power.",0394423291,9780394423296),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","The ultimate rapid language-learning guide! For those who’ve despaired of ever learning a foreign language, here, finally, is a book that will make the words stick. At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks six languages fluently.  He didn’t learn them in school -- who does? -- rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources. In Fluent Forever Wyner reveals what he’s discovered.   The greatest challenge to learning a foreign language is the challenge of memory; there are just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem to forget two old ones, and as a result, fluency can seem out of reach. Fluent Forever tackles this challenge head-on. With empathy for the language-challenged and abundant humor, Wyner deconstructs the learning process, revealing how to build a foreign language in your mind from the ground up.  Starting with pronunciation, you’ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar sounds. You'll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you'll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery, rather than translations, which will enable you to think in a foreign language.  And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you'll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in minutes every day. Soon, you'll gain the ability to learn grammar and more difficult abstract words--without the tedious drills and exercises of language classes and grammar books.  This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.",,,Paperback,,326 pages,"

","In this lyrical reimagining of the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber, set against the breathtaking backdrop of eighteenth-century Beijing, the lives of three unforgettable women collide in the inner chambers of the Jia mansion. When orphaned Daiyu leaves her home in the provinces to take shelter with her cousins in the Capital, she is drawn into a world of opulent splendor, presided over by the ruthless, scheming Xifeng and the prim, repressed Baochai. As she learns the secrets behind their glittering façades, she finds herself entangled in a web of intrigue and hidden passions, reaching from the petty gossip of the servants’ quarters all the way to the Imperial Palace. When a political coup overthrows the emperor and plunges the once-mighty family into grinding poverty, each woman must choose between love and duty, friendship and survival.  In this dazzling debut, Pauline A. Chen draws the reader deep into the secret, exquisite world of the women’s quarters of an aristocratic household, where the burnish of wealth and refinement mask a harsher truth: marriageable girls are traded like chattel for the family’s advancement, and to choose to love is to risk everything. ",0307701573,9780307701572),Hardcover,,386 pages,"

Ze is volledig bereid te vechten en zelfs te sterven voor vrijheid. Maar dan geeft president Snow Katniss te kennen dat hij iedereen van wie ze houdt kapot zal maken als de rebellen hun plannen doorzetten.

For anyone who has ever felt weighed down with worry, Gary Zimak lights the path to freedom.Even though the Bible tells us to ""be not afraid"" but it's next to impossible to follow that advice when faced with the big - and small - ""what-ifs"" of life. Chronic worrier Gary Zimak is no stranger to fear and anxiety, and in From Fear to Faith he shares his process for overcoming common and wearying fears and embracing the calm strength of faith through his 5-P method. As Gary says writes, by doing what we can and letting God take it from there, we can start feeling less anxious and more at more at peace today!Through biblical examples, prayers, and personal stories, Gary Zimak will help you start the journey from fear to faith as soon as you're ready. From what to pack to who needs to join you on the ride Gary ensures you're prepared for whatever anxiety-inducing situations meet you on your journey.",0764824929,9780764824920),Paperback,,144 pages,"

","Naomi: When I was kidnapped I thought only of survival. I don’t thrive well in chaos. That’s why I gave my captors exactly what they wanted: my skill with computers. Making millions for a crime lord who kept me imprisoned in his basement compound kept my family safe. When he was taken out, I thought my ticket to freedom had arrived. Wrong. I traded one keeper for another. This time I’m in the hands of a scarred, dark, demanding Russian who happens to be the head of the Bratva, a Russian crime organization. He wants my brain and my body. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued, but I can’t be a prisoner forever...no matter how good he makes me feel.Vasily: At a young age, I was taught that a man without power is a puppet for all. I’ve clawed—and killed—my way to the top so that it is my heel on their necks. But to unify the fractured organization into an undefeatable machine, I need a technological genius to help me steal one particular artifact. That she is breathtaking, determined, and vulnerable is making her more dangerous than all of my enemies combined. But only I can keep her safe from the world that she now inhabits. Soon, I must choose between Naomi and Bratva law. But with every day that passes, this becomes a more impossible choice.",,,Kindle Edition,,346 pages,"

Mark pri nej takmer zahynie, a keď sa preberie, nachádza sa v úplne novej životnej situácii. Ostal celkom sám na planéte, ktorá akoby sa ho zo všetkých síl pokúšala zabiť. Nemá ako oznámiť Zemi, že je nažive, a aj keby sa mu to podarilo, jeho zásoby ani zďaleka nepostačujú, aby prežil do príletu ďalšej kozmickej lode.Na druhej strane aj tak asi nebude mať dosť času, aby zomrel hladom. Poškodené vybavenie, kruté marťanské prostredie a starý známy „ľudský faktor“ so svojimi prešľapmi a chybami ho môžu zabiť oveľa skôr.Mark však nie je ochotný len tak to vzdať. Vďaka svojej vynaliezavosti, technickým schopnostiam a zarytému odhodlaniu vytrvalo bojuje s jednou neprekonateľnou prekážkou po druhej.

L'âge lyrique, selon Kundera, c'est la jeunesse. et ce roman est avant tout une épopée de l'adolescence ; épopée ironique qui corrode tendrement les valeurs taboues : l'Enfance, la Maternité, la Révolution et même - la Poésie. En effet, Jaromil est poète. C'est sa mère qui l'a fait poète et qui l'accompagne (immatériellement), jusqu'à ses lits d'amour et (matériellement) jusqu'à son lit de mort. Personnage ridicule et touchant, horrible et d'une innocence totale (l'innocence avec son sourire sanglant "" !), Jaromil est en même temps un vrai poète. Il n'est pas salaud, il est Rimbaud.

","The good news is that the vast majority of soldiers are loath to kill in battle. Unfortunately, modern armies, using Pavlovian and operant conditioning, have developed sophisticated ways of overcoming this instinctive aversion. The psychological cost for soldiers, as witnessed by the increase in post-traumatic stress, is devastating. The psychological cost for the rest of us is even more so: contemporary civilian society, particularly the media, replicates the army's conditioning techniques and, according to Grossman's controversial thesis, is responsible for our rising rate of murder and violence, especially among the young. ON KILLING is an important study of the techniques the military uses to overcome the powerful reluctance to kill, of how killing affects the soldier, and of the societal implications of escalating violence. ",,,Kindle Edition,,416 pages,"

After all, she’s been on a self-imposed losing streak since her survivalist parents died: she’s stopped painting, broken off her engagement to Adrian and dated a real jerk. Rectifying her mistakes has to wait, however, because Cassie and her friends have just enough time to escape Brooklyn for her parents’ cabin before Bornavirus LX turns them into zombies, too. This is difficult enough, but Cassie’s tag along ex-boyfriend and her friend’s bratty sister have a knack for making everything, even the apocalypse, more unpleasant. When the two attract a threat as deadly as the undead to their safe haven, Cassie’s forced to see how far she’ll go to protect those she loves. And it’s a lot farther than she’d anticipated. This, coupled with Adrian’s distant voice on Safe Zone Radio and, of course, the living dead, threaten to put Cassie right back into the funk she just dragged herself out of. Survival’s great and all, especially when you have leather armor, good friends and home-brewed beer, but there’s something Cassie must do besides survive: tell Adrian she still loves him. And to do that, Cassie has to find faith that she’s stronger than she thinks, she’s still a crack shot and true love never dies.",1491054492,9781491054499),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","“There are books that are suitable for a million people, others for only a hundred. There are even remedies—I mean books—that were written for one person only…A book is both medic and medicine at once. It makes a diagnosis as well as offering therapy. Putting the right novels to the appropriate ailments: that’s how I sell books.” Monsieur Perdu calls himself a literary apothecary. From his floating bookstore in a barge on the Seine, he prescribes novels for the hardships of life. Using his intuitive feel for the exact book a reader needs, Perdu mends broken hearts and souls. The only person he can't seem to heal through literature is himself; he's still haunted by heartbreak after his great love disappeared. She left him with only a letter, which he has never opened.After Perdu is finally tempted to read the letter, he hauls anchor and departs on a mission to the south of France, hoping to make peace with his loss and discover the end of the story. Joined by a bestselling but blocked author and a lovelorn Italian chef, Perdu travels along the country’s rivers, dispensing his wisdom and his books, showing that the literary world can take the human soul on a journey to heal itself.Internationally bestselling and filled with warmth and adventure, The Little Paris Bookshop is a love letter to books, meant for anyone who believes in the power of stories to shape people's lives.",0553418777,9780553418774),Hardcover,,392 pages,"

","Ο γιατρός Ριέ ανακαλύπτει μια μέρα στο κατώφλι του σπιτιού του στο Οράν της Αλγερίας ένα ψόφιο ποντικό. Στη συνέχεια, άπειρα ποντίκια βγαίνουν στους δρόμους της πόλης για να πεθάνουν... Στο Οράν εξαπλώνεται γρήγορα μια θανατηφόρα επιδημία στους κατοίκους. Στην διάρκεια ενός χρόνου, ο γιατρός βιώνει την απώλεια των αγαπημένων του ανθρώπων και στο τέλος, μετά από μια κρίση κατά τη διάρκεια της οποίας πυροβολεί τους περαστικούς από το μπαλκόνι του, φυλακίζεται με τη συνείδηση ότι έχει χάσει τα πάντα.

","Maddie Fynn is a shy high school junior, cursed with an eerie intuitive ability: she sees a series of unique digits hovering above the foreheads of each person she encounters. Her earliest memories are marked by these numbers, but it takes her father’s premature death for Maddie and her family to realize that these mysterious digits are actually death dates, and just like birthdays, everyone has one.Forced by her alcoholic mother to use her ability to make extra money, Maddie identifies the quickly approaching death date of one client's young son, but because her ability only allows her to see the when and not the how, she’s unable to offer any more insight. When the boy goes missing on that exact date, law enforcement turns to Maddie.Soon, Maddie is entangled in a homicide investigation, and more young people disappear and are later found murdered. A suspect for the investigation, a target for the murderer, and attracting the attentions of a mysterious young admirer who may be connected to it all, Maddie's whole existence is about to be turned upside down. Can she right things before it's too late?",1484700082,9781484700082),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","The New York Times–bestselling author’s richly imagined work of historical fiction: a powerful tale of the Old West from the acknowledged master of crime fiction. I had an eight-gauge shotgun that I’d taken with me when I left Wells Fargo. It didn’t take too long for things to develop. I sat in the tall lookout chair in the back of the saloon with the shotgun in my lap for two peaceful nights. On my third night it was different. I could almost smell trouble beginning to cook . . . .” After the bloody confrontation in Appaloosa, Everett Hitch heads into the afternoon sun and ends up in Resolution, an Old West town so new the dust has yet to settle. It’s the kind of town that doesn’t have much in the way of commerce, except for a handful of saloons and some houses of ill repute. Hitch takes a job as lookout at Amos Wolfson’s Blackfoot Saloon and quickly establishes his position as protector of the ladies who work the backrooms—as well as a man unafraid to stand up to the enforcer sent down from the O’Malley copper mine. Though Hitch makes short work of hired gun Koy Wickman, tensions continue to mount, so that even the self-assured Hitch is relieved by the arrival in town of his friend Virgil Cole. When greedy mine owner Eamon O’Malley threatens the loose coalition of local ranchers and starts buying up Resolution’s few businesses, Hitch and Cole find themselves in the middle of a makeshift war between O’Malley’s men and the ranchers. In a place where law and order don’t exist, Hitch and Cole must make their own, guided by their sense of duty, honor, and friendship.",039915504X,9780399155048),Hardcover,,292 pages,"

La prima iubire lumea se prăbuşeşte şi renaşte la fiecare atingere, la fiecare dialog, în fiecare zi.

So says Titus, whose ability to read, write, and even think for himself has been almost completely obliterated by his feed, a transmitter implanted directly into his brain. Feeds are a crucial part of life for Titus and his friends. After all, how else would they know where to party on the moon, how to get bargains at Weatherbee & Crotch, or how to accessorize the mysterious lesions everyone s been getting? But then Titus meets Violet, a girl who cares about what s happening to the world and challenges everything Titus and his friends hold dear. A girl who decides to fight the feed.Following in the footsteps of Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and Kurt Vonnegut, M. T. Anderson has created a not-so-brave new world and a smart, savage satire about the nature of consumerism and what it means to be a teenager in America.""",0763662623,9780763662622),Paperback,,300 pages,"

","Look at the state of the world right now. It’s a terrible mess, and that’s putting it mildly. There has never been a more dangerous time. The politicians and special interests in Washington, DC, are directly responsible for the mess we are in. So why should we continue listening to them?It’s time to bring America back to its rightful owners—the American people. I’m not going to play the same game politicians have been playing for decades—all talk, no action, while special interests and lobbyists dictate our laws. I am shaking up the establishment on both sides of the political aisle because I can’t be bought. I want to bring America back, to make it great and prosperous again, and to be sure we are respected by our allies and feared by our adversaries. It’s time for action. Americans are fed up with politics as usual. And they should be! In this book, I outline my vision to make America great again, including: how to fix our failing economy; how to reform health care so it is more efficient, cost-effective, and doesn’t alienate both doctors and patients; how to rebuild our military and start winning wars—instead of watching our enemies take over—while keeping our promises to our great veterans; how to ensure that our education system offers the resources that allow our students to compete internationally, so tomorrow’s jobseekers have the tools they need to succeed; and how to immediately bring jobs back to America by closing our doors to illegal immigrants, and pressuring businesses to produce their goods at home. This book is my blueprint for how to Make America Great Again. It’s not hard. We just need someone with the courage to say what needs to be said.",1501137964,9781501137969),Hardcover,,193 pages,"

"," Drawing on his own incarceration and exile, as well as on evidence from more than 200 fellow prisoners and Soviet archives, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn reveals the entire apparatus of Soviet repression -- the state within the state that ruled all-powerfully. Through truly Shakespearean portraits of its victims -- men, women, and children -- we encounter secret police operations, labor camps and prisons; the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the ""welcome"" that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. Yet we also witness the astounding moral courage of the incorruptible, who, defenseless, endured great brutality and degradation. The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 -- a grisly indictment of a regime, fashioned here into a veritable literary miracle -- has now been updated with a new introduction that includes the fall of the Soviet Union and Solzhenitsyn's move back to Russia.

","“The lawyer was crying...”  Legal Discipline Office Director, Dean Alessi, and his Chief Investigator, Stu Foley, are back investigating lawyers gone bad - this time the state’s top personal injury firm, Craig & Craig, run by ruthless brothers, Larry and David Craig, for sending clients to bad doctors for bogus surgeries to increase the value of their cases. The day after a young associate lawyer of the firm comes in crying and tells Dean and Stu that his client has died on the operating table during one of these surgeries, he commits suicide. But was it really suicide or was the young lawyer murdered by the Craig brother’s henchman, Nick “Sonny” Folino, a former mob associate, to keep him quiet?  Despite State Supreme Court Chief Justice Krane’s admonition that no further disciplinary investigations involving the Craigs or their firm be commenced while they are using their political might to help him get the vacant seat on the US Supreme Court, Dean and Stu secretly investigate the young lawyer’s claims and his suspicious death. In doing so, they find themselves in mortal danger.  Packed with surprising twists and turns leading to a thrilling conclusion, the story also continues to explore the friendship between Dean and Stu, Dean and Laura’s troubled marriage, and his unrequited affair with LDO staff attorney, Kat Franklin.  “Personal Injuries” takes the reader on a rip-roaring ride investigating more lawyers gone bad. In the process, it just may answer that ages-old adage, should you really be careful what you wish for?",,,Kindle Edition,,269 pages,"

As for the author, he held The Ambassadors as the favorite among all his novels.Sent from Massachusetts by the formidable Mrs. Newsome to recall her son, Chad, from what she assumes to be a corrupt life in Paris, Strether finds his intentions subtly and profoundly transformed as he falls under the spell of the city and of his charge. He is quick to perceive that Chad has been not so much corrupted as refined, and over the course of the hot summer months in Paris he gradually realizes that this discovery and acceptance of Chad's unconventional new lifestyle alter his own ideals and ambitions.One of Henry James's three final novels, all of which have sharply divided modern critics, The Ambassadors is the finely drawn portrait of a man's late awakening to the importance of morality that is founded not on the dictates of convention but on its value per se.",0140432337,9780140432336),Paperback,,528 pages,"

","It was the storm of the century, boasting waves over one hundred feet high - a tempest created by so rare a combination of factors that meteorologists deemed it ""the perfect storm."" When it struct in October 1991, there was virtually no warning. ""She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong,"" radioed Captain Billy Tyne of the Andrea Gail off the coast of Nova Scotia, and soon afterward the boat and its crew of six disappeared without a trace.In a narrative taut with the fury of the elements, Sebastian Junger takes us deep into the heart of the storm, depicting with vivid detail the courage, terror, and awe that surface in such a gale. Junger illuminates a world of swordfishermen consumed by the dangerous but lucrative trade of offshore fishing - ""a young man's game, a single man's game"" - and gives us a glimpse of their lives in the tough fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts; he recreates the last moments of the Andrea Gail crew and recounts the daring high-seas rescues that made heroes of some and victims of others; and he weaves together the history of the fishing industry, the science of storms, and the candid accounts of the people whose lives the storm touched.The Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller that leaves us with the taste of salt air on our tongues and a breathless sense of what it feels like to be caught, helpless, in the grip of a force of nature beyond our understanding or control. We know, on the strength of this stark and compelling journey into the dark heart of nature, what it feels like to drown.",039304016X,9780393040166),Hardcover,,227 pages,"

But when his father and three sons in line for the throne are killed in an ""accident,"" he has no choice but to take his place as the only surviving rightful heir.Entirely unschooled in the art of court politics, he has no friends, no advisors, and the sure knowledge that whoever assassinated his father and brothers could make an attempt on his life at any moment.Surrounded by sycophants eager to curry favor with the naïve new emperor, and overwhelmed by the burdens of his new life, he can trust nobody. Amid the swirl of plots to depose him, offers of arranged marriages, and the specter of the unknown conspirators who lurk in the shadows, he must quickly adjust to life as the Goblin Emperor. All the while, he is alone, and trying to find even a single friend . . . and hoping for the possibility of romance, yet also vigilant against the unseen enemies that threaten him, lest he lose his throne–or his life.Katherine Addison’s The Goblin Emperor is an exciting fantasy novel, set against the pageantry and color of a fascinating, unique world, is a memorable debut for a great new talent.",076532699X,9780765326997),Hardcover,,446 pages,"

There's nothing quite as devastating as believing you're the best, then meeting someone better. Welcome to hell...



Rebecca has vanished and Abby is determined to get her back at all costs. Unbeknownst to her, Monarch Enterprises is not only tracking Abby, they’ve dispatched the murderous young assassin, Delta 1A, for her once more. Not only is the assassin’s system disintegrating, his savage bloodlust has him targeting random civilians as well. The closer Monarch and Delta 1A come to finding Abby, however, the more Abby’s problems with love and mortality seem to spiral out of control.

With Abby’s and Brayden’s friendship in deep crisis, they are torn apart, then driven back together in the midst of a frightening and merciless attack. With calamity bringing them closer than ever, both as friends and potentially more, startling revelations unfold about the two of them and the kind of intimacy and insanity they are capable of together.

When one of Abby’s friends escapes Gerhard’s care, she does so as something darkly paranormal. Whether it’s accelerated childbirth, mixing the DNA of intensely psychotic children with the DNA of unwitting subjects, or bringing the dead back to life, doctors Gerhard and Heim are rewriting the fabric of reality. With her enemies tightening the noose, Abby must face Monarch’s assassin, the doctor who transformed her, the psycho who tried to kill her and a demented child with a penchant for melting people’s guts. No matter Abby’s ever-expanding skillset, Masochist is proof that no matter how bad ass a girl gets, there’s always someone better, meaner and far more lethal.


Due to mature content, Masochist is recommended for ages 15 and up.



INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR



Q – How do I get 

Vannie, 

The Swann series prequel, when it’s not listed on Amazon?
A – Inside Masochist or at the author’s website, you’ll find a link to download the FREE prequel. Vannie is an engaging read, a 47 page novella that can be enjoyed in a single sitting before or after Masochist, although you’ll probably like the series even more if you start with Vannie.


Q – What makes the Swann series special?
A – I remember devouring the Harry Potter books thinking there was always something thrilling about each new adventure. The kinds of literary highs these stories inspire produce a feeling like no other! We’ve seen vampires, werewolves, angels, demons and tales from the dystopian future; I desperately wanted to tap into the next evolution of the young adult fiction genre! From this mindset, the Swann series was born…


Q – What order should I read the books in?
A – The books are meant to be read in the following order:

 
   Vannie 
   Swann 
   Monarch 
   Clone 
   Masochist 
   Weapon 
   Raven 
   Abomination

Unlike Stevenson's work in Fantasy Fiction and Courtroom Drama, The Skinwalker: Resurrection promises psychological thrills like no other-a dark spirit, a possession, a hidden identity, a love story, the mighty tribe of the Navajo, and a finale that will surprise you. Shortly after the discovery of a mysterious book of witchcraft spells in her home, Carmella unknowingly invites something sinister into her world, a long deceased Navajo skinwalker, and this skinwalker wants to walk the Earth in human flesh again. The witch's faithful servant follows each step that Carmella takes as he serves his Mistress. Slowly but surely, she falls prey to the darkness, and only the tribe is left to help her. With the support of her friends and the man that she loves, she is taken to the reservation and a traditional ceremony ensues.

","The men on board Her Britannic Majesty's Ships Terror and Erebus had every expectation of triumph. They were part of Sir John Franklin's 1845 expedition - as scientifically advanced an enterprise as had ever set forth - and theirs were the first steam-driven vessels to go in search of the fabled North-West Passage. But the ships have now been trapped in the Arctic ice for nearly two years. Coal and provisions are running low. Yet the real threat isn't the constantly shifting landscape of white or the flesh-numbing temperatures, dwindling supplies or the vessels being slowly crushed by the unyielding grip of the frozen ocean. No, the real threat is far more terrifying. There is something out there that haunts the frigid darkness, which stalks the ships, snatching one man at a time - mutilating, devouring. A nameless thing, at once nowhere and everywhere, this terror has become the expedition's nemesis. When Franklin meets a terrible death, it falls to Captain Francis Crozier of HMS Terror to take command and lead the remaining crew on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Eskimo woman who cannot speak. She may be the key to survival - or the harbinger of their deaths. And as scurvy, starvation and madness take their toll, as the Terror on the ice become evermore bold, Crozier and his men begin to fear there is no escape...",0553818201,9780553818208),Paperback,,936 pages,"

","The never-before-seen history of Westeros and the lands beyond. With hundreds of pages of all-new material from George R.R. Martin.If the past is prologue, then George R. R. Martin’s masterwork—the most inventive and entertaining fantasy saga of our time—warrants one hell of an introduction. At long last, it has arrived with The World of Ice and Fire.This lavishly illustrated volume is a comprehensive history of the Seven Kingdoms, providing vividly constructed accounts of the epic battles, bitter rivalries, and daring rebellions that lead to the events of A Song of Ice and Fire and HBO’s Game of Thrones. In a collaboration that’s been years in the making, Martin has teamed with Elio M. García, Jr., and Linda Antonsson, the founders of the renowned fan site Westeros.org—perhaps the only people who know this world almost as well as its visionary creator.Collected here is all the accumulated knowledge, scholarly speculation, and inherited folk tales of maesters and septons, maegi and singers. It is a chronicle which stretches from the Dawn Age to the Age of Heroes; from the Coming of the First Men to the arrival of Aegon the Conqueror; from Aegon’s establishment of the Iron Throne to Robert’s Rebellion and the fall of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, which has set into motion the “present-day” struggles of the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, and Targaryens. The definitive companion piece to George R. R. Martin’s dazzlingly conceived universe, The World of Ice and Fire is indeed proof that the pen is mightier than a storm of swords.",0007580916,9780007580910),Hardcover,,326 pages,"

","No doctrine is more central to the message of the restored gospel or to our individual happiness than the infinite and eternal Atonement of Jesus Christ. In this clearly written and powerfully moving book, Tad Callister focuses on the infinite power, coverage, and depth of the Atonement, and how the most profound blessings of the gospel are eternally linked to it. The Savior experienced infinite suffering as he brought the Atonement to pass, but because of the Atonement we are capable of experiencing the blessings of the resurrection and exaltation, of repentance, of freedom, of peace of mind, and of the healing of the Savior's infinite love. The Infinite Atonement is an outstanding book that can be read from cover to cover or used as a reference to study selected aspects of the Atonement. It is destined to become a classic.",,,Kindle Edition,,356 pages,"

","Gold Pen Award-winning author ReShonda Tate Billingsley returns to the Houston congregation of her #1 Essence magazine bestseller, Let the Church Say Amen, in this warm and powerful sequel.  When her husband hears God's call to become a preacher, Rachel Jackson Adams is distressed -- she grew up a preacher's daughter, and knows how difficult life under the microscope can be for a reverend's family. But hot-headed Rachel has toned down her wild ways, and for the sake of her marriage and her two children, she is now the reluctant first lady of Zion Hill, unafraid to rock the boat with her unconventional ideas for revitalizing the church. When her son, Jordan, begins fighting at school, Rachel turns to the boy's father, Bobby -- Rachel's first love from years ago. Married now himself, there should be nothing between them except their concern for Jordan -- so why does seeing Bobby again feel so distractingly tempting? With her brothers facing dramas of their own, and her father, Reverend Simon Jackson, recovering from illness, Rachel must listen carefully to discover what God truly wants for her -- and to decide if Bobby is the lover of her dreams or the devil in disguise",,,Kindle Edition,,306 pages,"

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys.

","(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed) Aanton Chekhov, widely hailed as the supreme master of the short story, also wrote five works long enough to be called short novels–here brought together in one volume for the first time, in a masterly new translation by the award-winning translators Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. The Steppe–the most lyrical of the five–is an account of a nine-year-old boy’s frightening journey by wagon train across the steppe of southern Russia. The Duel sets two decadent figures–a fanatical rationalist and a man of literary sensibility–on a collision course that ends in a series of surprising reversals. In The Story of an Unknown Man, a political radical spying on an important official by serving as valet to his son gradually discovers that his own terminal illness has changed his long-held priorities in startling ways. Three Years recounts a complex series of ironies in the personal life of a rich but passive Moscow merchant. In My Life, a man renounces wealth and social position for a life of manual labor. The resulting conflict between the moral simplicity of his ideals and the complex realities of human nature culminates in a brief apocalyptic vision that is unique in Chekhov’s work.",,,Kindle Edition,,578 pages,"

This Folio edition is translated from the Latin by Robert Graves, author of I, Claudius.As private secretary to the Emperor Hadrian, the scholar Suetonius had access to the imperial archives and used them (along with eyewitness accounts) to produce one of the most colourful biographical works in history. The Twelve Caesars chronicles the public careers and private lives of the men who wielded absolute power over Rome, from the foundation of the empire under Julius Caesar and Augustus, to the decline into depravity and civil war under Nero and the recovery that came with his successors. A masterpiece of observation, anecdote and detailed physical description, The Twelve Caesars presents us with a gallery of vividly drawn - and all too human - individuals.",0140440720,9780140440720),Paperback,,363 pages,"

","Here is a book as joyous and painful, as mysterious and memorable, as childhood itself. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide.   Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.   Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.”—James Baldwin",0375507892,9780375507892),Hardcover,,281 pages,"

","This intimate portrait by his former personal assistant and confidante reveals the man behind the legendary filmmaker—for the first time.Stanley Kubrick, the director of a string of timeless movies from Lolita and Dr. Strangelove to A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Full Metal Jacket, and others, has always been depicted by the media as the Howard Hughes of filmmakers, a weird artist obsessed with his work and privacy to the point of madness. But who was he really? Emilio D'Alessandro lets us see. A former Formula Ford driver who was a minicab chauffeur in London during the Swinging Sixties, he took a job driving a giant phallus through the city that became his introduction to the director. Honest, reliable, and ready to take on any task, Emilio found his way into Kubrick's neurotic, obsessive heart. He became his personal assistant, his right-hand man and confidant, working for him from A Clockwork Orange until Kubrick's death in 1999.Emilio was the silent guy in the room when the script for The Shining was discussed. He still has the coat Jack Nicholson used in the movie. He was an extra on the set of Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick's last movie. He knew all the actors and producers Kubrick worked with; he observed firsthand Kubrick's working methods down to the smallest detail. Making no claim of expertise in cinematography but with plenty of anecdotes, he offers a completely fresh perspective on the artist and a warm, affecting portrait of a generous, kind, caring man who was a perfectionist in work and life.",1628726695,9781628726695),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

La prueba de que las matemáticas carecen de sentido. Un lenguaje alienígena que permite a quienes lo aprenden expandir su consciencia a lo largo del tiempo. La cábala y la teoría de la preformación se combinan en una Inglaterra victoriana salida de nuestros sueños, o de nuestras pesadillas.

","Lecha Jęczmyka można by określić jako anarchizującego prawicowca, osobę niepoprawną politycznie, ale trzeba określić go przede wszystkim jako wnikliwego i błyskotliwego analityka naszej współczesności. Czytelnik niezajmujący się myślą społeczno-polityczną po przeczytaniu wyboru najlepszych felietonów Lecha Jęczmyka publikowanych pod wspólnym tytułem Nowe Średniowiecze nie tylko będzie oczarowany jędrnym, żywym językiem, nie tylko będzie pod wrażeniem trafności i żywotności jego rozważań, ale będzie przekonany, że jest to niezwykle ważny autor w fundamentalnych debatach nad kondycją naszej cywilizacji. Niektórzy będą w nim nawet widzieć polskiego Huntingtona czy Fukuyamę. Można się z poglądami autora książki nie zgadzać, ja sam z niektórymi teoriami bym polemizował, pewne uważać za nietrafione, ale nie można wobec nich przejść obojętnie. Dr Tadeusz Zysk, wydawca Lech Jęczmyk urodził się w 1936 roku w Bydgoszczy, a od 1939 mieszka w Warszawie. Z wykształcenia jest filologiem rosyjskim. W latach 1984-2003 ściśle współpracował z miesięcznikiem ""Fantastyka"" (""Nowa Fantastyka""), publikował także we ""Frondzie"", ""Gazecie Polskiej"", ""Rzeczpospolitej""; był (krótko) kierownikiem działu publicystyki w telewizji publicznej.

","A debut of extraordinary distinction: Ayana Mathis tells the story of the children of the Great Migration through the trials of one unforgettable family.  In 1923, fifteen-year-old Hattie Shepherd flees Georgia and settles in Philadelphia, hoping for a chance at a better life. Instead, she marries a man who will bring her nothing but disappointment and watches helplessly as her firstborn twins succumb to an illness a few pennies could have prevented.  Hattie gives birth to nine more children whom she raises with grit and mettle and not an ounce of the tenderness they crave.  She vows to prepare them for the calamitous difficulty they are sure to face in their later lives, to meet a world that will not love them, a world that will not be kind. Captured here in twelve luminous narrative threads, their lives tell the story of a mother’s monumental courage and the journey of a nation.  Beautiful and devastating, Ayana Mathis’s The Twelve Tribes of Hattie is wondrous from first to last—glorious, harrowing, unexpectedly uplifting, and blazing with life. An emotionally transfixing page-turner, a searing portrait of striving in the face of insurmountable adversity, an indelible encounter with the resilience of the human spirit and the driving force of the American dream, Mathis’s first novel heralds the arrival of a major new voice in contemporary fiction. ",0385350287,9780385350280),Hardcover,,243 pages,"

","Lang voordat ze de schrik van Wonderland was, was de Hartenkoningin een meisje dat ontzettend graag verliefd wilde worden. Lady Catherine Pinkerton heeft maar één toekomstdroom: samen met haar dienstmeisje de beste banketbakkerij van Wonderland openen. Haar ouders, de Markies en Markiezin van Rotsschildpadbaai, koppelen Cath echter liever aan de nogal domme, oncharismatische Hartenkoning –en niet zonder succes. Als Catherine op een koninklijk bal kennismaakt met de nieuwe, mysterieuze hofnar van de koning, is haar bakkerij opeens niet meer het enige waar ze aan denkt. Voor het eerst in haar leven ervaart ze wat het is om verliefd te zijn. Cath is vastberaden haar eigen toekomst te bepalen, ook als ze daarmee het risico loopt de koning te beledigen en de toorn van haar ouders over zich af te roepen.Maar in het land dat bruist van de magie en waar monsters en mafketels niet ongewoon zijn, lijkt haar lot toch anders te zijn bepaald…",9020678965,9789020678963),Hardcover,,511 pages,"

Al direct bij aankomst raakt hij gefascineerd door het selecte clubje van vijf rijke studenten rond de charismatische docent Julian Morrow. Richard stelt alles in het werk om in die excentrieke en arrogante elite, die de antieke Griekse beschaving bestudeert, te worden opgenomen.

In hun hoogmoed hebben de jonge studenten een plaatselijke boer aan een experimenteel onderzoek opgeofferd.

Policie se zprvu domnívá, že se mladík stal obětí rituální vraždy před stovkami let, avšak vytetovaný obrázek Elvise Presleyho na mladíkově pravé paži odhalí, že se vražda musela stát mnohem později, ve druhé polovině dvacátého století.Bývalý policejní detektiv Fin Macleod se mezitím vrací na svůj rodný ostrov. Rozešel se s manželkou, s životem v Edinburghu i s kariérou u policie a nyní se snaží obnovit staré vztahy a opravit zchátralý dům po svých rodičích.

He sees his parents pulled between the meager farm with its sense of independence and the mining camp with its uncertain promise of material prosperity. In his world privation, violence, and death are part of everyday life, accepted and endured. Yet it is a world of dignity, love, and humor, of natural beauty which Still evokes in sharp, poetic images. No writer has caught more effectively the vividness of mountain speech or shown more honestly the trials and joys of mountain life.",0813113725,9780813113722),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The Ultimate Egoist, the first volume of The Complete Stories of Theodore Sturgeon, contains the late author's earliest work, written from 1937 to 1940. Although Sturgeon's reach was limited to the lengths of the short story and novelette, his influence was strongly felt by even the most original science fiction stylists, including Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Gene Wolfe, each of whom contributes a laudatory foreword. The more than 40 stories here showcase Sturgeon's masterful knack with clever, O. Henry-ish plot twists, sparkling character development, and almost archetypal, why didn't I think of that? story ideas. Early Sturgeon masterpieces include ""It,"" about the violence done by a creature spontaneously born from garbage and mud, and ""Helix the Cat,"" about an inventor's bizarre encounter with a disembodied soul and the cat that saves it. Sturgeon's unique genius is timelessly entertaining.Table of Contents:Forewords by Ray Bradbury,Arthur C.

","From the internationally bestselling author of the acclaimed novel The Power of the Dog comes The Cartel, a gripping true-to-life epic, ripped from the headlines, of power, corruption, revenge and justice spanning the past decade of the Mexican–American drug wars.It’s 2004. DEA agent Art Keller has been fighting the war on drugs for thirty years in a blood feud against Adan Barrera, the head of El Federación, the world’s most powerful cartel, and the man who brutally murdered Keller’s partner. Finally putting Barrera away costs Keller dearly – the woman he loves, the beliefs he cherishes, the life he wants to lead.Then Barrera gets out, determined to rebuild the empire that Keller shattered. Unwilling to live in a world with Barrera in it, Keller goes on a ten-year odyssey to take him down. His obsession with justice – or is it revenge – becomes a ruthless struggle that stretches from the cities, mountains and deserts of Mexico, to Washington’s corridors of power, to the streets of Berlin and Barcelona.Keller fights his personal battle against the devastated backdrop of Mexico’s drug war, a conflict of unprecedented scale and viciousness, as cartels vie for power and he comes to the final reckoning with Barrera – and himself - that he always knew must happen.The Cartel is a story of power, corruption, revenge, honour and sacrifice, as one man tries to face down the devil without losing his soul. It is the story of the war on drugs and the men – and women – who wage it.",0434023558,9780434023554),Paperback,,640 pages,"

","Gone with the Wind is a novel written by Margaret Mitchell, first published in 1936. The story is set in Clayton County, Georgia, and Atlanta during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of the poverty she finds herself in after Sherman's March to the Sea. A historical novel, the story is a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson.  Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the onset and was the top American fiction bestseller in the year it was published and in 1937. As of 2014, a Harris poll found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible.

","This is the definitive, textually accurate edition of a classic of twentieth-century literature, The Great Gatsby. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan has been acclaimed by generations of readers. But the first edition contained a number of errors resulting from Fitzgerald's extensive revisions and a rushed production schedule. Subsequent printings introduced further departures from the author's words. This edition, based on the Cambridge critical text, restores all the language of Fitzgerald's masterpiece. Drawing on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, along with Fitzgerald's later revisions and corrections, this is the authorized text -- The Great Gatsby as Fitzgerald intended it.",0684801523,9780684801520),Paperback,,216 pages,"

","From the  New York Times  bestselling author of  Midwives and  The Sandcastle Girls  comes the spellbinding tale of a party gone horribly wrong: two men lie dead in a suburban living room; two women are on the run from police; and a marriage is ripping apart at the seams.   When Richard Chapman offers to host his younger brother's bachelor party, he expects a certain amount of debauchery. He sends his wife, Kristin, and young daughter off to his mother-in-law's for the weekend, and he opens his Westchester home to his brother's friends and their hired entertainment. What he does not expect is this: bacchanalian drunkenness, a dangerously intimate moment in his guest bedroom, and two naked women stabbing and killing their Russian bodyguards before driving off into the night. In the aftermath, Richard's life rapidly spirals into a nightmare. The police throw him out of his home, now a crime scene; his investment banking firm puts him on indefinite leave; and his wife finds herself unable to forgive him for the moment he shared with a dark-haired girl in the guest room. But the dark-haired girl, Alexandra, faces a much graver danger. In one breathless, violent night, she is free, running to escape the police who will arrest her and the gangsters who will kill her in a heartbeat. A captivating, chilling story about shame and scandal, The Guest Room is a riveting novel from one of our greatest storytellers.",0385538898,9780385538893),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","""Ik heb me al zo vaak in mijn broer vergist. Ik dacht altijd dat ik hem goed kende en dat hij voorspelbaar was. Ik dacht dat ik wist hoe hij in elkaar zit, maar inmiddels moet ik toegeven, dat ik geen idee meer heb wie Misha is en waar hij toe in staat is.""Beroepswerkeloze Lennart Larsen en zijn jongere broer, succesvol architect Misha, zijn in alles elkaars tegenpolen. Lennart brengt zijn dagen door met drinken, blowen en het behouden van zijn Sociale Dienst uitkering, terwijl Misha zestien uur per dag werkt. Hun ouders zijn vijftien jaar eerder omgekomen bij een auto-ongeluk en dat verlies is een kruispunt gebleken, waarop de broers beiden een andere afslag hebben genomen. Het contact tussen hen verloopt uiterst moeizaam en er gaan soms peri odes van weken voorbij, waarin ze helemaal geen contact hebben. Wanneer Misha echter langere tijd zijn telefoon niet opneemt en Lennart op onderzoek uitgaat, ontdekt hij dat zijn broer ontslag heeft genomen en is vertrokken naar Amerika.Het is het begin van een wekenlange zoektocht, die Lennart genadeloos hard confronteert met het verleden, leugens en waarheden, geheimen, raadsels, codes, dubbele agenda's en herinneringen. Naarmate zijn zoektocht vordert en hij steeds meer aspecten van Misha's leven ontsluiert, komt Lennart erachter dat hij zijn broer helemaal niet goed kent en dat hij geen idee heeft waar Misha toe in staat is. Ondertussen gaat Misha de confrontatie aan met de geesten uit zijn verleden en nieuwe demonen, terwijl het geheim dat hij al vijftien jaar met zich meedraagt hem steeds verder de duisternis intrekt en hij zich in een uitzichtloze wraakmissie stort. Onbedoeld en ongewild trekt hij daarbij de aandacht van seriemoordenaar Donald Skinner. De gevolgen zijn niet te overzien.",9082137003,9789082137002),Paperback,,716 pages,"

","Listening Length: 12 hours and 12 minutes""Are there any questions?"" The final line in Margaret Atwood's modern classic, The Handmaid's Tale, has teased and perplexed fans since the book's original release more than 30 years ago. Now, in this Audible Original production, listeners get some of the answers they've waited so long to hear.Featuring an all-new interview with Professor Piexoto, written by Atwood and performed by a full cast, The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition is a must-listen for both fans and newcomers alike. Emmy Award winner Claire Danes (Homeland, Temple Grandin) gives a stirring performance of this classic in speculative fiction, where the message (and the warning) is now more timely than ever. In addition to rich sound design that honors the audio origins of Atwood's classic, the special edition also includes a brand-new afterword from the author and an introduction written by author Valerie Martin (Mary Reilly, Property).After a violent coup in the United States overthrows the Constitution and ushers in a new government regime, the Republic of Gilead imposes subservient roles on all women. Offred, now a Handmaid tasked with the singular role of procreation in the childless household of the enigmatic Commander and his bitter wife, can remember a time when she lived with her husband and daughter and had a job, before she lost everything, even her own name. Despite the danger, Offred learns to navigate the intimate secrets of those who control her every move, risking her life for mere glimpses of her former freedom, and records her story for future listeners.Whether you're a fan of the original novel or someone who has recently discovered it, The Handmaid's Tale: Special Edition will shock, impress, and satisfy all those who listen.Listening Length: 12 hours and 12 minutes©1985 O.W.

","Being among bees is a full-body experience, Mark Winston writes--from the low hum of tens of thousands of insects and the pungent smell of honey and beeswax, to the sight of workers flying back and forth between flowers and the hive. The experience of an apiary slows our sense of time, heightens our awareness, and inspires awe. Bee Time presents Winston's reflections on three decades spent studying these creatures, and on the lessons they can teach about how humans might better interact with one another and the natural world.Like us, honeybees represent a pinnacle of animal sociality. How they submerge individual needs into the colony collective provides a lens through which to ponder human societies. Winston explains how bees process information, structure work, and communicate, and examines how corporate boardrooms are using bee societies as a model to improve collaboration. He investigates how bees have altered our understanding of agricultural ecosystems and how urban planners are looking to bees in designing more nature-friendly cities.The relationship between bees and people has not always been benign. Bee populations are diminishing due to human impact, and we cannot afford to ignore what the demise of bees tells us about our own tenuous affiliation with nature. Toxic interactions between pesticides and bee diseases have been particularly harmful, foreshadowing similar effects of pesticides on human health. There is much to learn from bees in how they respond to these challenges. In sustaining their societies, bees teach us ways to sustain our own.",0674970853,9780674970854),Paperback,,296 pages,"

","In the early 1990s three young people attracted to the ambitious global peacekeeping work of the UN cross paths in Cambodia. Andrew strives for a better world through his life-saving work as a doctor. Heidi, a social worker, is in need of a challenge and a paycheck, and Ken is fresh from Harvard and brimful of idealism. As their stories interweave through the years, from Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia to Haiti, the trio reveal a world of witnessed atrocities, primal fear, desperate loneliness and base desires. They fend off terror and futility with revelry, humour and sex; ask hard questions about the world order America has created, the true power of the UN, and whether there is any possibility for change.This is a startling celebration of the power of humour and friendship, of the limits of human compassion, and the need for a warm body and a cold beer during a Condition Echo lockdown. A book that shows the human cost of global politics and the tragic truth that wars are much more avoidable than our governments would ever admit.

Silence stretches as wide as an ocean. When I look up, Felicity has this expression on her face like she's just seen Elvis. Slowly, she leans forward and in a gentle voice I've never heard her use before she says, 'Have you done a pregnancy test?' When Hedda discovers she is pregnant, she doesn’t believe she could ever look after a baby. The numbers just don’t add up. She is young, and still in the grip of an eating disorder that controls every aspect of how she goes about her daily life. She’s even given her eating disorder a name – Nia. But as the days tick by, Hedda comes to a decision: she and Nia will call a truce, just until the baby is born. 17 weeks, 119 days, 357 meals. She can do it, if she takes it one day at a time … Heartbreaking and hopeful by turns, Karen Gregory’s debut novel is a story of love, heartache and human resilience.

","“An enduring testament and prophecy.” –Chicago Sun-Times Mr. Artur Sammler, Holocaust survivor, intellectual, and occasional lecturer at Columbia University in 1960s New York City, is a “registrar of madness,” a refined and civilized being caught among people crazy with the promises of the future (moon landings, endless possibilities).  His Cyclopean gaze reflects on the degradations of city life while looking deep into the sufferings of the human soul.  “Sorry for all and sore at heart,” he observes how greater luxury and leisure have only led to more human suffering. To Mr. Sammler—who by the end of this ferociously unsentimental novel has found the compassionate consciousness necessary to bridge the gap between himself and his fellow beings—a good life is one in which a person does what is “required of him.” To know and to meet the “terms of the contract” was as true a life as one could possibly live.  At its heart, this novel is quintessential Bellow: moral, urbane, sublimely humane.

","Oscar Wilde, que se notabilizou sobretudo como dramaturgo, escreveu um único romance, 'O Retrato de Dorian Gray', obra que causou escândalo e controvérsia na Inglaterra vitoriana. Dorian Gray é um homem rico que vende a alma em troca da juventude eterna. A passagem do tempo não lhe altera a bela aparência, enquanto o seu retrato mágico envelhece e revela a decadência interior. Expressando as preocupações estéticas e os paradoxos morais de Wilde, a narrativa constitui uma reflexão sobre o envelhecimento, o prazer, o crime e o castigo.[sinopse da contracapa]",9726115973,9789726115977),Hardcover,Biblioteca Visão: Colecção Novis #7,256 pages,"

","From two-time Carnegie Medal winner Patrick Ness comes an enthralling and provocative new novel chronicling the life — or perhaps afterlife — of a teen trapped in a crumbling, abandoned world. A boy named Seth drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments, losing his life as the pounding sea claims him. But then he wakes. He is naked, thirsty, starving. But alive. How is that possible? He remembers dying, his bones breaking, his skull dashed upon the rocks. So how is he here? And where is this place? It looks like the suburban English town where he lived as a child, before an unthinkable tragedy happened and his family moved to America. But the neighborhood around his old house is overgrown, covered in dust, and completely abandoned. What’s going on? And why is it that whenever he closes his eyes, he falls prey to vivid, agonizing memories that seem more real than the world around him? Seth begins a search for answers, hoping that he might not be alone, that this might not be the hell he fears it to be, that there might be more than just this. . . .",,,Kindle Edition,,480 pages,"

","Pitir does it again! Some authors speak of genre bending, some authors prove it. After winning the 2015 Best Indie Book Award for Action/Adventure and receiving the B.R.A.G. Medallion, FACE OF OUR FATHER was just awarded the Bronze Medal for Popular Fiction by the 2016 eLit Awards. This novel has it all. One part ""The Bourne Identity,"" one part ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and one part ""The Notebook,"" this poignant tale leaves the reader haunted by its characters long after the novel's final page has turned. Stuart and Angela Pierce, like many disillusioned careerists, are busy reinventing their lives. Stu reduces his airline flying schedule to train for triathlons, while Angie escapes the daily horrors of a prosecutor’s job to pursue pro bono work. But death threats soon prove that the only thing Angie escaped was the protective arm of the District Attorney’s office. With a graphic photo of a ritual stoning Stu’s only tangible clue, he sets out to protect a wife who refuses to protect herself. Obsessed with catching a murdering rapist, Angie plunges them both into a web of global intrigue. But who, indeed what, is the real enemy? Honor. Love. Life. All are at stake as the Pierces struggle to uncover the truth, both the enemy’s, and their own. Sometimes the biggest enemy can be the one right next to you… FACE OF OUR FATHER is too literary to be a thriller, yet too thrilling to put down—a unique blend of action and intimacy—a thriller with a soul. How often does fiction change how we define integrity, prejudice, and evil? To get at all that, a novel needs a rollercoaster of a plot coupled with an acute understanding of identity, love, and where these intersect. Test your beliefs. Read it.",,,Kindle Edition,,377 pages,"

","When fate throws a Confederate soldier and a Yankee heiress together, they’ll uncover a fierce love worth fighting for…even if it means crossing enemy lines.  From the award-winning, bestselling author of The Winds of Fate comes a novel about a love that crosses the boundaries of civil war.  When Confederate General John Daniel Rourke is severely wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness, he’s captured and sent to a prison camp. On his way there, Union soldiers mistake him for dead and toss him from the train into the New York countryside, where he lands at the feet of Catherine Fitzgerald, a schoolmistress.  Rourke wakes to find the mysterious and strong-spirited beauty nursing him back to health. He’s intrigued but unaware of her true identity as the heiress to the Union’s ammunitions manufacturer, and their fiery battle of wits and wills commences.  Yet when outside forces begin to envelop them in a larger conspiracy, their own war begins. Torn between family loyalties and manipulated by a powerful leader from the Irish underworld, Catherine and Rourke will have to fight on both sides of the secession line to win the most significant battle of all: the fight for their love.  Filled with detailed battle scenes and breathtaking twists, Surrender the Wind has won “the Marlene” and “the Catherine” Romance Writer’s Awards.",,,Kindle Edition,,387 pages,"

He’s really young and super cute and thinks Annie would make an excellent library monitor. But after meeting Mr. Gabriel, Cyn realizes something isn’t quite right. Maybe it’s the creepy look in the librarian’s eyes, or the weird feeling Cyn gets whenever she’s around him. Before long Cyn realizes that Mr. Gabriel is, in fact . . . a demon. Now, in addition to saving the school musical from technical disaster and trying not to make a fool of herself with her own hopeless crush, Cyn has to save her best friend from the clutches of the evil librarian, who also seems to be slowly sucking the life force out of the entire student body!

A year later he married his travel agent, while Sophie has been mortifyingly single ever since. Now Thomas is back in her life because Sophie has unexpectedly inherited his aunt Connie's house on Scribbly Gum Island -- home of the famously unsolved Munro Baby mystery.

Grace, a beautiful young mother, is feverishly planning a shocking escape from her perfect life. Margie, a frumpy housewife, has made a pact with a stranger, while dreamy Aunt Rose wonders if maybe it's about time she started making her own decisions.

","Traducere din limba spaniolă și note de Dragoș Cojocaru Ne aflăm în Barcelona anului 1945. Într-o dimineață cețoasă, domnul Sempere, proprietar al unui anticariat din inima orașului vechi, își duce fiul, Daniel, la Cimitirul Cărților Uitate, o clădire impunătoare, veche și sumbra, plină de volume ale unor autori necunoscuți sau uitați, cărți aduse de oameni care au ținut să le ferească de părăsire, de indiferență sau de la dispariție. Potrivit tradiției, cine intră pentru prima oară trebuie să adopte o carte. Dintre miile de tomuri, Daniel se simte atras de Umbra vîntului de Julian Carax, un roman misterios pe care, ajuns acasă, îl citește în aceeași noapte dintr-o suflare. În anii următori, Daniel se pomenește implicat într-o serie de intrigi și de crime, trecînd prin numeroase primejdii pentru a salva cartea de anumite persoane. În același timp, el se lansează în cercetarea amănunțită a biografiei autorului, cel puțin la fel de enigmatică și de stranie precum romanele sale. „Dacă ați crezut cumva ca marele roman gotic a murit odată cu secolul al XIX-lea, Umbra vîntului o să vă facă să vă răzgîndiți. Un roman de primă mînă, plin de capcane, de intrigi care se desfac unele din altele.” (Stephen King) „O aventură fantastică, un roman scris parcă de Jorge Luis Borges în stilul Numelui trandafirului. Zafon are grijă să dozeze iubirea, magicul, crimele și nebunia astfel încît să-l captiveze pînă și pe cititorul cel mai sceptic. Diabolic de bun!” (Elle) „Umbra vîntului este, în fond, o scrisoare de dragoste adresată literaturii și cititorilor la fel de pasionați de povești precum tînărul erou al cărții.” (Entertainment Weekly)",,,,,488 pages,"

What if one day we woke up in the wrong world?Every night, a woman on a black warhorse gallops through the mist in Chris Redston's dreams. Every night, she begs him not to come to her. Every night, she aims her rifle at his head and fires. The last thing Chris expects—or wants—is for this nightmare to be real. But when he wakes up in the world of his dreams, he has to choose between the likelihood that he’s gone spectacularly bonkers or the possibility that he’s just been let in on the secret of the ages.Only one person in a generation may cross the worlds. These chosen few are the Gifted, called from Earth into Lael to shape the epochs of history—and Chris is one of them. But before he figures that out, he accidentally endangers both worlds by resurrecting a vengeful prince intent on claiming the powers of the Gifted for himself. Together with a suspicious princess and a guilt-ridden Cherazii warrior, Chris must hurl himself into a battle to save a country from war, two worlds from annihilation, and himself from a dream come way too true.",0978924681,9780978924683),Paperback,,544 pages,"

","Why is the brain divided? The difference between right & left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries. In a book of unprecedented scope, McGilchrist draws on a vast body of recent brain research, illustrated with case histories, to reveal that the difference is profound—not just this or that function, but two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world. The left hemisphere is detail oriented, prefers mechanisms to living things & is inclined to self-interest. The right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility & generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music & language, & casts new light on the history of philosophy, as well as on some mental illnesses. The 2nd part of the book takes a journey thru the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought & belief of thinkers & artists, from Aeschylus to Magritte. He argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in the modern world, with potentially disastrous consequences.List of IllustrationsAcknowledgmentsIntroductionAsymmetry and the brain --What do the two hemispheres 'do'? --Language, truth and music --The nature of the two worlds --The primacy of the right hemisphere --The triumph of the left hemisphere --Imitation and the evolution of culture --The ancient world --The Renaissance and the Reformation --The Enlightenment --Romanticism and the Industrial Revolution --The modern and post-modern worldsConclusionNotes BibliographyIndex",030014878X,9780300148787),Hardcover,,608 pages,"

Just like that, Lucy breaks with all the constants in her life: her do-good boyfriend, her steady faith, even her longtime summer church camp job.Instead, Lucy lands at a camp for kids who have been through tough times. As a counselor, Lucy is in over her head and longs to be with her parents across the lake. But that’s before she gets to know her coworkers, who are as loving and unafraid as she so desperately wants to be.It’s not just new friends that Lucy discovers at camp—more than one old secret is revealed along the way.

","A gripping tale of unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion. alt cover for ISBN: 9780679720218 ",,,Paperback,Vintage International Series,308 pages,"

","What can we learn from the genomes of our closest evolutionary relatives?Neanderthal Man tells the story of geneticist Svante Pääbo’s mission to answer this question, and recounts his ultimately successful efforts to genetically define what makes us different from our Neanderthal cousins. Beginning with the study of DNA in Egyptian mummies in the early 1980s and culminating in the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome in 2010, Neanderthal Man describes the events, intrigues, failures, and triumphs of these scientifically rich years through the lens of the pioneer and inventor of the field of ancient DNA.We learn that Neanderthal genes offer a unique window into the lives of our hominin relatives and may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of why humans survived while Neanderthals went extinct. Drawing on genetic and fossil clues, Pääbo explores what is known about the origin of modern humans and their relationship to the Neanderthals and describes the fierce debate surrounding the nature of the two species’ interactions. His findings have not only redrawn our family tree, but recast the fundamentals of human history—the biological beginnings of fully modern Homo sapiens, the direct ancestors of all people alive today.A riveting story about a visionary researcher and the nature of scientific inquiry, Neanderthal Man offers rich insight into the fundamental question of who we are.",0465020836,9780465020836),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Minneapolis detectives Leo Magozzi and Gino Rolseth are bored - ever since they solved the Monkeewrench case, the Twin Cities have been in a murder-free dry spell, as people no longer seem interested in killing one another. But with two brutal homicides taking place in one awful night, the crime drought ends - not with a trickle, but with an eventual torrent. Who would kill Morey Gilbert, a man without an enemy, a man who might as well have been a saint? His tiny, cranky little wife, Lily, is no help, and may even be a suspect; his estranged son, Jack, an infamous ambulance-chasing lawyer, has his own enemies; and his son-in-law, former cop Marty Pullman, is so depressed over his wife's death a year ago that he's ready to kill himself, but not Morey. The number of victims - all elderly - grows, and the city is fearful once again."" The detectives' investigation threatens to uncover a series of horrendous secrets, some buried within the heart of the police department itself, blurring the lines between heroes and villains.

","Para la vaniria Daanna McKenna, la inmortalidad es como vivir una larga y agónica muerte. Marcada por las estrellas en su nacimiento, y ungida por los dioses en su transformación, se ha visto obligada a existir sobreprotegida, sin luz y sin libertad, esperando a que despierte el supuesto don que la hace tan importante para su clan. Ahora, cuando el ragnarök está llegando a sus puertas, los dioses exigen su participación directa en el desenlace de la guerra. Pero Freyja no da nada gratuitamente: Daanna podrá recibir su don. Sin embargo, lo que nunca imaginó era que la llave que liberaba su poder estaba en manos del hombre que le había robado y pisoteado el corazón, y que estaba a un paso de entregarse a la oscuridad. Ella luchará por recuperarlo de las tinieblas, consciente de que en la travesía por rescatar al vanirio, no sólo podría perder el orgullo que la había mantenido en pie siglo tras siglo, si no que, además, él exigiría su alma a cambio.La eternidad y Menw McCloud eran sinónimo de martirio y también de contradicción. Él, el sanador de los vanirios keltois, era incapaz de encontrar una cura a su desesperación. Durante más de dos mil años había esperado que su inequívoca cáraid le perdonara y le diera la oportunidad de explicarse, y mientras esperaba a que eso sucediera, pagaba por un pecado que él, en realidad, nunca había cometido. Ahora, la Elegida, después de mucho tiempo atormentándolo, ya había logrado su objetivo vengándose de él y lanzándolo al abismo de la sangre y de las tinieblas. Sin embargo, el destino le tenía una última sorpresa reservada: la propia Daanna. Menw tendrá la posibilidad de entregarle el don o de hacerla caer en desgracia.Loki busca la grieta por la que entrar al Midgard. Newscientist presiona a los clanes. Los dioses mueven ficha.

An emotional residue that lingers... floating unseen, like bacteria in the air, just waiting to be absorbed. To be experienced.To be interpreted.And only the man and the boy know this.Veteran major crimes detective, Kate Messenger, has a problem on her hands: six bodies—father, mother, three children and the family dog—all slaughtered in their own home, with not a single clue or a shred of DNA that points to the butcher who killed them. But late one night, as she’s visiting what the newspapers have dubbed the House of Pain, Kate finds a couple of intruders at her crime scene: a man and a young blind boy who have no real explanation for their presence there.In the hours that follow, Kate will discover that this is no ordinary boy—not by a long shot—and his ability to “read” the lingering residue left the killer and his victims will not only open some old and very tender wounds, but may also help her find a killer who has been watching her every move…",,,Kindle Edition,,213 pages,"

","Lion is the heartbreaking and inspiring original true story of the lost little boy who found his way home twenty-five years later and is now a major film starring Dev Patel, Nicole Kidman and Rooney Mara.As a five-year old in India, I got lost on a train. Twenty-five years later, I crossed the world to find my way back home. Five-year-old Saroo lived in a poor village in India, in a one-room hut with his mother and three siblings... until the day he boarded a train alone and got lost. For twenty-five years.This is the story of what happened to Saroo in those twenty-five years. How he ended up on the streets of Calcutta. And survived. How he then ended up in Tasmania, living the life of an upper-middle-class Aussie. And how, at thirty years old, with some dogged determination, a heap of good luck and the power of Google Earth, he found his way back home.Lion is a triumphant true story of survival against all odds and a shining example of the extraordinary feats we can achieve when hope endures.'Amazing stuff' The New York Post'So incredible that sometimes it reads like a work of fiction' Winnipeg Free Press (Canada)'A remarkable story' Sydney Morning Herald Review'I literally could not put this book down.

","With the publication of her first novel, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is considered McCullers' finest work, and an enduring masterpiece.At its center is the deaf-mute John Singer, who becomes the confidant for various types of misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for escape from small-town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane, Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's heroine (loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her music. Brilliantly attuned to the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated--and, through Mick Kelly, to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.",0140181326,9780140181326),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Sadima lives in a world where magic has been banned, leaving poor villagers prey to fakes and charlatans. A magician stole her family's few valuables and left Sadima's mother to die on the day Sadima was born. But vestiges of magic are hidden in old rhymes and hearth tales and in people like Sadima, who conceals her silent communication with animals for fear of rejection and ridicule. When rumors of her gift reach Somiss, a young nobleman obsessed with restoring magic, he sends Franklin, his lifelong servant, to find her. Sadima's joy at sharing her secret becomes love for the man she shares it with. But Franklin's irrevocable bond to the brilliant and dangerous Somiss traps her, too, and she faces a heartbreaking decision. Centuries later magic has been restored, but it is available only to the wealthy and is strictly controlled by wizards within a sequestered academy of magic. Hahp, the expendable second son of a rich merchant, is forced into the academy and finds himself paired with Gerrard, a peasant boy inexplicably admitted with nine sons of privilege and wealth. Only one of the ten students will graduate -- and the first academic requirement is survival. Sadima's and Hahp's worlds are separated by generations, but their lives are connected in surprising and powerful ways in this brilliant first book of Kathleen Duey's dark, complex, and completely compelling trilogy.",0689840934,9780689840937),Hardcover,,357 pages,"

","„Čempionų pusryčiai“ – groteskiška, politiškai nekorektiška, šiek tiek nešvanki, socialiai kritiška ir labai juokinga knyga. Ji pirmą kartą išleista 1973 m., tačiau puikiai dera prie šiandienės Lietuvos gyvenimo, kur įsigalėjo vartotojiškas gyvenimo būdas, karjerizmas, masinė ir reklamos kultūra su visais jiems būdingais absurdais ir kvailybėm.Respektabilus verslininkas Dveinas Huveris iškeliauja į menų festivalį Midlende, į kurį atvyksta ir mokslinės fantastikos rašytojas Kilgoras Trautas. Jo romanas atskleidžia Dveinui „tiesą“, kad visas jį supantis pasaulis tėra piktavalis Visatos kūrėjo eksperimentas, o visi žmonės – robotai, bejausmės mašinos, kurios gyvena kasdienį nuobodų gyvenimą, dauginasi, kariauja, žudo viena kitą, teršia gamtą, alina ir naikiną savo planetą...Kurtas Vonnegutas – išeivio iš Vokietijos proanūkis, gimė 1922 m. Indianapolyje (Indianos valstija). Sąjungininkų armijoje dalyvavo Antrajame pasauliniame kare, buvo patekęs į hitlerininkų nelaisvę. Prieš karą studijavo biochemiją, po karo – antropologiją, o šeštojo dešimtmečio pradžioje atsidėjo vien literatūrai. Sukūrė unikalų literatūrinį stilių, jungiantį mokslinę fantastiką su juoduoju humoru bei socialine satyra.„Literatūrinės meistrystės viršūnė.“ Joseph Heller„Linksma žmonijos pražūties pranašystė.“ New York Times„Aštri mintis, beribė išmonė ir subtilus humoras veikia kaip intraveniniai narkotikai.“ Daily Telegraph„Itin humaniška knyga, nors gelia iki skausmo“ Kate Atkinson",,,Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","The legend begins...Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the kingdom of Phthia to be raised in the shadow of King Peleus and his golden son, Achilles. “The best of all the Greeks”—strong, beautiful, and the child of a goddess—Achilles is everything the shamed Patroclus is not. Yet despite their differences, the boys become steadfast companions. Their bond deepens as they grow into young men and become skilled in the arts of war and medicine—much to the displeasure and the fury of Achilles’ mother, Thetis, a cruel sea goddess with a hatred of mortals.When word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, the men of Greece, bound by blood and oath, must lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller’s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.",,,Kindle Edition,US Edition,370 pages,"

","In the POINTS OF VIEW series, the hero is a young blind Londoner, named Horace Mayberry, who is a cautious lad, who occasionally enjoys vivid dreams of being a secret agent. Then he becomes fitted with superhuman, nanotronic, eyes for free, but there is a catch.. They are inherently intelligent and can develop various functions to assist in whatever awkward situations he experiences. In payment for the eyes, he is recruited into a secret government agency as an apprehensive assistant to an experienced agent and embarks on a series of adventures, including being abducted twice by an international gang of terrorists. Their leader, Rudolph Beckman, is a billionaire financier who is after the secrets of the laboratory that developed the nanotronic eyes. He uses a trio of henchmen to do his bidding.Each risky situation Horace encounters causes his eyes to develop something new, and enables his introvert personality to evolve too. His dreams become more meaningful as he becomes somewhat impulsive and headstrong. The exciting finale in this first volume covers an attack by the two agents, backed up by a Spanish SWAT team, on the crooks hideout in Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands!",,,ebook,,,"

In the latest electrifying adventure in Tom Clancy's #1 New York Times bestselling series, Jack Ryan, Jr., learns that sometimes the deadliest secret may be standing right next to you.
Former U.S. Senator Weston Rhodes is a defense contractor with an urgent problem. His company needs someone to look over the books of Dalfan Technologies, a Singapore company—quickly. He turns to his old friend Gerry Hendley for help. Hendley Associates is one of the best financial analysis firms in the country and the cover for The Campus, a top-secret American intelligence agency. Rhodes asks for two specific analysts, Jack Ryan Jr., and Paul Brown, a mild-mannered forensic accountant.Both Ryan and Brown initially resist, for different reasons. On the long flight over, Ryan worries he’s being sidelined from the next Campus operation in America’s war on terror. Brown—who was never very good with people—only worries about the numbers, and finding a good cup of tea.Brown has no idea Jack works for The Campus but the awkward accountant is hiding secrets of his own. Rhodes has tasked him with uploading a cyberwarfare program into the highly secure Dalfan Technologies mainframe on behalf of the CIA.On the verge of mission success, Brown discovers a game within the game, and the people who now want to kill him are as deadly as the cyclone bearing down on the island nation. Together Ryan and Brown race to escape both the murderous storm and a team of trained assassins in order to prevent a global catastrophe, even at the cost of their own lives.",1524780464,9781524780463),Audio CD,,14 pages,"

As she retreats further into her own world, Toru finds himself reaching out to others and drawn to a fiercely independent and sexually liberated young woman.A poignant story of one college student's romantic coming-of-age, Norwegian Wood takes us to that distant place of a young man's first, hopeless, and heroic love.",,,Paperback,,372 pages,"

","Venti anni dopo la fine della seconda guerra mondiale, a un generale e a un colonnello cappellano dell’Esercito italiano viene affidato il delicato e gravoso incarico di ritrovare i resti dei nostri soldati caduti in Albania. La solennità della missione si infrange ben presto contro le difficoltà che nascono dall’oscura «alleanza» di un clima ostile, di una terra impervia che pare voler trattenere i resti degli odiati nemici e dell’inesorabile fierezza di un popolo per il quale sembra che la guerra sia una condizione di vita. Quando infine il generale sarà pronto a riportare in patria la sua «armata morta» si renderà conto di avere esumato, insieme con i poveri resti, ostilità, rancori, sospetti, risvegliando così l’atavico istinto di un popolo che – come dice lo stesso autore – «ha sempre avuto il gusto di uccidere e di farsi uccidere».Rievocando gli orrori della guerra d’Albania, Ismail Kadaré costruisce un romanzo di rara intensità, in cui emergono in tutta la loro crudezza la forza primordiale della violenza che grava sul destino degli uomini e la follia della guerra che unisce vincitori e vinti nella medesima desolazione",8878181358,9788878181359),Paperback,,223 pages,"

","Indigno de ser humano es, dentro de la literatura japonesa, una de las novelas más relevantes del pasado siglo. Publicada en 1948, pocos meses antes del suicidio de Osamu Dazai, es una obra de tintes autobiográficos que describe el descenso a los infiernos de un hombre incapaz de avenirse a los usos de una sociedad hipócrita.El cuerpo de la novela lo componen los cuadernos escritos en primera persona por Yozo, el protagonista, que rememora su existencia desde su infancia. La narración en primera persona, que se detiene en detalles en apariencia intrascendentes pero capaces de poner de manifiesto la psicología del personaje, permite seguir el deterioro de una personalidad hipersensible al contacto con la hipocresía de la sociedad. Sin embargo, la degradación de Yozo es consecuencia de su incapacidad para adaptarse a los dictados de la sociedad; y esa incapacidad es percibida por el protagonista como una falla suya que jamás podrá superar. La narración logra con sutileza hacer hincapié en ese sentimiento de sentirse responsable de no haber sido capaz de comportarse como un ser humano. «Mi vida ha estado llena de vergüenza» comienzan sus apuntes, «La verdad es que no tengo la más remota idea de lo que es vivir como un ser humano».Desde temprana edad, el pequeño Yochan adivina que hay algo en él que le hace diferente de aquellos que le rodean, sean familiares, amigos o criados. La observación de las personas de su entorno pronto le lleva a descubrir que el egoísmo, la indiferencia y la conformidad son las cualidades de aquellos que por las noches son capaces de conciliar el sueño. Pero a Yozo le hace permanecer insomne la idea de que la maldad es una característica intrínseca del ser humano, una característica que le es necesaria para sobrevivir. La conciencia de esta realidad hace que el terror paralice al muchacho en sus intentos de establecer una relación sana con su entorno.El muchacho se refugia en lo que él mismo denomina “bufonería”, para desde ella acercarse a las personas de su entorno. Desarrollando sus dotes histriónicas, Yochan levanta una barrera de humor entre su persona y la maldad de los seres humanos. Convencido de que mientras estén ocupados riéndose con él (o de él, el matiz resulta indiferente) no podrán hacerle daño, el narrador vive una vida de payaso a pesar del miedo indescriptible que le atenaza.La tensión provocada por ese necesario fingimiento, por esa división entre la cara divertida que muestra al mundo y el terrible pánico que le atenaza, es el eje sobre el que pivota la novela; así como la explicación para la degradación que Yozo sufrirá cuando abandone su provincia de origen y el ambiente de la casa familiar —que él siempre ha juzgado opresivo—, para cursar estudios superiores en Tokio.Allí conoce a Horiki, un joven mayor que él que le resulta atractivo por su vida licenciosa. Aunque Yozo comprende que, como del resto, le separa de Horiki su conciencia de la farsa del mundo, al menos éste vive en cierto modo, y gracias a su depravación, alejado de los convencionalismos de una sociedad podrida. De este modo, Yochan acepta a Horiki como un simple compañero de diversión que le descubrirá las delicias del libertinaje. Gracias al alcohol y las drogas, Yozo logra olvidar su terror a la gente y relacionarse con los demás de una manera más natural. Sin embargo, la realidad que descubrió ya en su niñez sigue latente en su interior, de modo que cada vez necesitará dosis más grandes de alcohol y morfina para hacer frente a ese pavor, hasta acabar en un sanatorio mental.",,,Paperback,,124 pages,"

","Deren pertenece al tipo de cineastas y artistas que elaboraron toda una teoría sobre su propio arte de un modo creativo y analítico al mismo tiempo, siendo demiurga de una poética y teoría del cine propias. Ilustración de ello son los textos que presentamos en este libro, todos inéditos hasta ahora en castellano, y que nos ayudarán a acercarnos al poliédrico universo de este personaje complejo, contribuyendo a una mejor comprensión de su obra cinematográfica y dándonos una idea de la enorme dimensión de su trabajo. Esta recopilación engloba los textos que he considerado fundamentales en la obra de Maya Deren. La mayoría son textos completos, ordenados cronológicamente (incluyendo, entre otros, su ensayo más importante: Un anagrama de ideas sobre arte, forma y cine); al final del libro, hay un conjunto de notas y diversos apuntes de Deren sobre sus películas y sobre diversos temas, que pueden servir de guía rápida para acompañar el visionado de sus películas.",,,Paperback,,237 pages,"

Resultatet är Tårar i havet - en gripande berättelse, skriven med stor omsorg om de historiska detaljerna.I januari 1945 är tusentals människor i Ostpreussen på flykt undan sovjetiska trupper. Bland flyktingarna finns ungdomarna Joana, Emilia och Florian. De har olika bakgrund och bär alla på hemligheter, men deras vägar korsas och de finner mod och styrka hos varandra. Tillsammans försöker de ta sig till Wilhelm Gustloff - ett fartyg som kan föra dem till tryggheten västerut över Östersjön. Men katastrofen inträffar precis när de tror sig ha friheten inom räckhåll och då spelar varken nationalitet eller klasstillhörighet någon roll.

","Karren Brady is Britain’s best-known business woman. An inspiration to women everywhere, her incredible success is borne of her passion, impressive business instinct, ambition, and her very genuine, honest, down-to-earth outlook.This is her story… how she started out as a sparky 18 year old selling advertising space and how she went on to persuade David Sullivan, at the age of 23 to buy a football club – turning that business round to sell it for an incredible £82 million 12 years later. How she balances her personal life with her professional, her priorities, her life as mother of two and wife. How she coped when doctors told her after a routine scan that she had a brain anheurysm, that she must have a complicated operation immediately and had a 30% chance of not surviving, and how it has since influenced her outlook and priorities.An overwhelmingly inspiring and real look at work and life, Karren Brady defies convention as a directional business woman in a male industry. This is how she does it, and through her experience, her drive and her skills - it’s a brilliant insight into how you can do it too.",,,Kindle Edition,,301 pages,"

Set in South Carolina in 1964, The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of Lily Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. When Lily's fierce-hearted ""stand-in mother,"" Rosaleen, insults three of the town's fiercest racists, Lily decides they should both escape to Tiburon, South Carolina--a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. There they are taken in by an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters who introduce Lily to a mesmerizing world of bees, honey, and the Black Madonna who presides over their household.

","Jon Padgett's The Secret of Ventriloquism, named the Best Fiction Book of 2016 by Rue Morgue Magazine, heralds the arrival of a significant new literary talent. With themes reminiscent of Shirley Jackson, Thomas Ligotti, and Bruno Schulz, but with a strikingly unique vision, Padgett's work explores the mystery of human suffering, the agony of personal existence, and the ghastly means by which someone might achieve salvation from both. A bullied child seeks vengeance within a bed's hollow box spring. A lucid dreamer is haunted by an impossible house. A dummy reveals its own anatomy in 20 simple steps. A stuttering librarian holds the key to a mill town's unspeakable secrets. A commuter's worldview is shattered by two words printed on a cardboard sign. An aspiring ventriloquist spends a little too much time looking at himself in a mirror. And a presence speaks through them all.Contents: Introduction by Matt Cardin The Mindfulness of Horror Practice Murmurs of a Voice Foreknown The Indoor Swamp Origami Dreams 20 Simple Steps to Ventriloquism Infusorium Organ Void The Secret of VentriloquismEscape to Thin Mountain",,,Kindle Edition,,198 pages,"

","From one of our most powerful writers, a work of stunning frankness about losing a daughter. Richly textured with bits of her own childhood and married life with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and daughter, Quintana Roo, this new book by Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts regarding having children, illness, and growing old.  Blue Nights opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana’s wedding in New York seven years before. Today would be her wedding anniversary. This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana’s childhood—in Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not taken or perhaps displaced. “How could I have missed what was clearly there to be seen?” Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other. Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.  Blue Nights—the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice, “the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning”—like The Year of Magical Thinking before it, is an iconic book of incisive and electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.",0307267679,9780307267672),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","In the summer of 1935, six-year-old Emily Evans vanishes from her family’s vacation home on a remote Minnesota lake. Her disappearance destroys her mother, who spends the rest of her life at the lake house, hoping in vain that her favorite daughter will walk out of the woods. Emily’s two older sisters stay, too, each keeping her own private, decades-long vigil for the lost child. Sixty years later Lucy, the quiet and watchful middle sister, lives in the lake house alone. Before she dies, she writes the story of that devastating summer in a notebook that she leaves, along with the house, to the only person to whom it might matter: her grandniece, Justine. For Justine, the lake house offers a chance to escape her manipulative boyfriend and give her daughters the stable home she never had. But it’s not the sanctuary she hoped for. The long Minnesota winter has begun. The house is cold and dilapidated, the frozen lake is silent and forbidding, and her only neighbor is a strange old man who seems to know more than he’s telling about the summer of 1935.Soon Justine’s troubled oldest daughter becomes obsessed with Emily’s disappearance, her mother arrives with designs on her inheritance, and the man she left behind launches a dangerous plan to get her back. In a house steeped in the sorrows of the women who came before her, Justine must overcome their tragic legacy if she hopes to save herself and her children.",0062456601,9780062456601),Hardcover,,341 pages,"

","For readers of Room and The Glass Castle, an astonishing memoir of one woman rising above an unimaginable childhood. Maude Julien's parents were fanatics who believed it was their sacred duty to turn her into the ultimate survivor - raising her in isolation, tyrannizing her childhood and subjecting her to endless drills designed to ""eliminate weakness."" Maude learned to hold an electric fence for minutes without flinching, and to sit perfectly still in a rat-infested cellar all night long (her mother sewed bells onto her clothes that would give her away if she moved). She endured a life without heat, hot water, adequate food, friendship, or any kind of affectionate treatment.But Maude's parents could not rule her inner life. Befriending the animals on the lonely estate as well as the characters in the novels she read in secret, young Maude nurtured in herself the compassion and love that her parents forbid as weak. And when, after more than a decade, an outsider managed to penetrate her family's paranoid world, Maude seized her opportunity. By turns horrifying and magical, The Only Girl in the World is a story that will grip you from the first page and leave you spellbound, a chilling exploration of psychological control that ends with a glorious escape.",,,Kindle Edition,,289 pages,"

","Verdadeiro clássico moderno, concebido por um dos mais influentes escritores do século 20, ""A Revolução dos Bichos"" é uma fábula sobre o poder. Narra a insurreição dos animais de uma granja contra seus donos. Progressivamente, porém, a revolução degenera numa tirania ainda mais opressiva que a dos humanosEscrita em plena Segunda Guerra Mundial e publicada em 1945 depois de ter sido rejeitada por várias editoras, essa pequena narrativa causou desconforto ao satirizar ferozmente a ditadura stalinista numa época em que os soviéticos ainda eram aliados do Ocidente na luta contra o eixo nazifascista.De fato, são claras as referências: o despótico Napoleão seria Stálin, o banido Bola-de-Neve seria Trotsky, e os eventos políticos - expurgos, instituição de um estado policial, deturpação tendenciosa da História - mimetizam os que estavam em curso na União Soviética.Com o acirramento da Guerra Fria, as mesmas razões que causaram constrangimento na época de sua publicação levaram A Revolução Dos Bichos a ser amplamente usada pelo Ocidente nas décadas seguintes como arma ideológica contra o comunismo. O próprio Orwell, adepto do socialismo e inimigo de qualquer forma de manipulação política, sentiu-se incomodado com a utilização de sua fábula como panfleto.",8535909559,9788535909555),Paperback,,152 pages,"

","Averno is a small crater lake in southern Italy, regarded by the ancient Romans as the entrance to the underworld. That place gives its name to Louise Glück's tenth collection: in a landscape turned irretrievably to winter, it is a gate or passageway that invites traffic between worlds while at the same time resisting their reconciliation. Averno is an extended lamentation, its long, restless poems no less spellbinding for being without conventional resoltution or consolation, no less ravishing for being savage, grief-stricken. What Averno provides is not a map to a point of arrival or departure, but a diagram of where we are, the harrowing, enduring present.Averno is a 2006 National Book Award Finalist for Poetry.",0374530742,9780374530747),Paperback,,79 pages,"

","Tout le monde connaît le chef-d'œuvre d'Oscar Wilde tel qu'il a été publié en volume en 1891. Cette version diffère considérablement du manuscrit qu’il avait soumis quelques mois plus tôt au Lippincott's Magazine où le roman devait paraître en prépublication. Le directeur, par pruderie, l'avait sérieusement raboté, ce qui ne l'a pas empêché de provoquer un premier soulèvement d'indignation. Par la suite, Wilde a augmenté et remanié son roman, estompant ses passages les plus audacieux. La critique instruisait déjà son procès en immoralité. Il a fallu attendre 2011 pour que, en Angleterre, des universitaires rendent disponible le texte initial, avant les censures successives. C’est cette version que les Cahiers rouges publient pour la première fois en France. La trame reste inchangée. Dans le Londres fin de siècle, le peintre Basil Hallward tombe en adoration devant son modèle, le beau Dorian Gray. Leur chaste idylle commence, troublée par l'intervention d'un vieux camarade de Hallward, Lord Henry. Dandy hédoniste amoureux des bons mots, affichant avec insolence son homosexualité, il convainc Dorian de l'importance capitale de sa beauté. Un jour viendra où la vieillesse l'aura défiguré et plus personne ne le regardera. Horrifié, Dorian conclut un pacte faustien avec le portrait que Hallward a peint de lui : ce n'est plus lui que le temps abîmera, mais l’image du tableau. Le Portrait de Dorian Gray non censuré est encore plus délicieusement décadent et surtout plus ouvertement homosexuel. Le pouvoir érotique de Dorian est exacerbé, nombre de phrases rendent indubitable et intense la nature des sentiments de Hallward pour lui. On retrouvera bien sûr les saillies du spirituel Lord Henry, notamment le fameux : « De nos jours on sait le prix de tout, mais on ne connaît la valeur de rien. »",2246862353,9782246862352),Paperback,Les Cahiers Rouges,224 pages,"

Charles Montfort accidentally shot himself while cleaning his revolver.

Mas Kemal está noivo da filha de uma das famílias da elite istambulense. Entretanto, Kemal começa a coleccionar objectos pessoais e outros que lhe fazem lembrar a sua amada. Esses objectos são simultaneamente um fetiche e uma crónica da sua felicidade e das mágoas, um mapa de sinais de todos os sítios onde estiveram juntos. Com o tempo, a compulsão do coleccionador acabará por dar origem a verdadeiro museu, que também permite explorar uma Istambul meio ocidental e meio tradicional, a sua emergente modernidade e a sua vastíssima história e cultura.«O que está exposto neste museu é a responsabilidade de escrever livremente e de forma actual.»New York Times Book Review «Pamuk é um verdadeiro achado, o criador de ficções literárias sofisticadas e intensas (...)

The Wolverine is the key to opening up Alaska and its huge reserves of gold to the outside world, but previous attempts have ended in tragedy.For Forrester, the decision to accept this mission is even more difficult, as he is only recently married to Sophie, the wife he had perhaps never expected to find. Sophie is pregnant with their first child, and does not relish the prospect of a year in a military barracks while her husband embarks upon the journey of a lifetime. She has genuine cause to worry about her pregnancy, and it is with deep uncertainty about what their future holds that she and her husband part.A story shot through with a darker but potent strand of the magic that illuminated The Snow Child, and with the sweep and insight that characterizes Rose Tremain's The Colour, this novel from Pulitzer Prize finalist Eowyn Ivey singles her out as a major literary talent.",0316242853,9780316242851),Hardcover,,417 pages,"

","Savor the magic of the season with #1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber’s newest Christmas novel, filled with warmth, humor, the promise of love, and a dash of unexpected adventure.Ashley Davison, a graduate student in California, desperately wants to spend the holidays with her family in Seattle. Dashiell Sutherland, a former army intelligence officer, has a job interview in Seattle and must arrive by December 23. Though frantic to book a last-minute flight out of San Francisco, both are out of luck: Every flight is full, and there’s only one rental car available. Ashley and Dash reluctantly decide to share the car, but neither anticipates the wild ride ahead.At first they drive in silence, but forced into close quarters Ashley and Dash can’t help but open up. Not only do they find they have a lot in common, but there’s even a spark of romance in the air. Their feelings catch them off guard—never before has either been so excited about a first meeting. But the two are in for more twists and turns along the way as they rescue a lost puppy, run into petty thieves, and even get caught up in a case of mistaken identity. Though Ashley and Dash may never reach Seattle in time for Christmas, the season is still full of surprises—and their greatest wishes may yet come true.",0553391690,9780553391695),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","When the great Velázquez was painting his masterpieces at the Spanish court in the seventeenth century, his colors were expertly mixed and his canvases carefully prepared by his slave, Juan de Pareja. In a vibrant novel which depicts both the beauty and the cruelty of the time and place, Elizabeth Borton de Treviño tells the story of Juan, who was born a slave and died an accomplished and respected artist.Upon the death of his indulgent mistress in Seville, Juan de Pareja was uprooted from the only home he had known and placed in the charge of a vicious gypsy muleteer to be sent north to his mistress's nephew and heir, Diego Velázquez, who recognized at once the intelligence and gentle breeding which were to make Juan his indispensable assistant and companion—and his lifelong friend.Through Juan's eyes the reader sees Velázquez's delightful family, his working habits and the character of the man, his relations with the shy yet devoted King Philip IV and with his fellow painters, Rubens and Murillo, the climate and customs of Spanish court life. When Velázquez discovers that he and Juan share a love for the art which is his very life, the painter proves his friendship in the most incredible fashion, for in those days it was forbidden by law for slaves to learn or practice the arts. Through the hardships of voyages to Italy, through the illnesses of Velázquez, Juan de Pareja loyally serves until the death of the painter in 1660.I, Juan de Pareja is the winner of the 1966 Newbery Medal.Latino Interest.",0312380054,9780312380052),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","On 3 December 1976, just weeks before the general election and two days before Bob Marley was to play the Smile Jamaica Concert to ease political tensions, seven gunmen from West Kingston stormed his house with machine guns blazing. Marley survived and went on to perform at the free concert, but the next day he left the country, and didnt return for two years. Not a lot was recorded about the fate of the seven gunmen, but much has been said, whispered and sung about in the streets of West Kingston, with information surfacing at odd times, only to sink into rumour and misinformation.Inspired by this near-mythic event, A Brief History of Seven Killings takes the form of an imagined oral biography, told by ghosts, witnesses, killers, members of parliament, drug dealers, conmen, beauty queens, FBI and CIA agents, reporters, journalists, and even Keith Richards' drug dealer. Marlon Jamess bold undertaking traverses strange landscapes and shady characters, as motivations are examined and questions asked in this compelling novel of monumental scope and ambition.",1780745885,9781780745886),ebook,,617 pages,"

Hugely controversial, you will either love this book or hate it. Some will feel challenged and uncomfortable by the topic it deals with, and others will be drawn into it and unable to put it down... the question is, what will you think? A young student at Oxford University has an idea for his doctor’s thesis (Ph.D.), which fulfils not only the criteria for ‘originality’, but goes far beyond it. For if Jason Dyke is right, his idea will soon change the world and shift the delicate balance of power from one nation to another. Jason’s idea is simple: In the genetics laboratory at Oxford University, he will clone Jesus Christ. But when the CIA finds out about his plan, the President of America realises that if the UK succeeds, the balance of power will shift from the USA to Europe. And he decides that the only way to stop this happening is for America to create its very own clone of Jesus Christ. The race is on...Whoever reads this book will never forget it. And they will ask….one of two questions:- 1: Is it really possible? 2: When will it happen?",,,Kindle Edition,,236 pages,"

On November 10, 2009, the German national goalkeeper, Robert Enke, stepped in front of a passing train. He was 32 years old. Viewed from the outside, Enke had it all. He was a professional goalkeeper who had played for a string of Europe's top clubs, including Jose Mourinho's Benfica and Louis Van Gaal's Barcelona, and was destined to be his country's first choice for years to come. But beneath the bright veneer of success lay a darker story. Reng brings into sharp relief the specific demands and fears faced by those who play top-level sport.

","Every year, the average American eats 33 pounds of cheese and 70 pounds of sugar. They ingest 8,500 milligrams of salt a day, double the recommended amount, almost none of which comes from salt shakers. It comes from processed food, an industry that hauls in $1 trillion in annual sales.  In Salt Sugar Fat, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Michael Moss shows how this happened. Featuring examples from some of the most recognizable (and profitable) companies and brands of the last half century--including Kraft, Coca-Cola, Lunchables, Kellogg, Nestlé, Oreos, Cargill, Capri Sun, and many more--Moss’s explosive, empowering narrative is grounded in meticulous, often eye-opening research. He goes inside the labs where food scientists use cutting-edge technology to calculate the ""bliss point"" of sugary beverages or enhance the ""mouth feel"" of fat by manipulating its chemical structure. He unearths marketing techniques taken straight from tobacco company playbooks to redirect concerns about the health risks of products. He talks to concerned executives who explain that they could never produce truly healthy alternatives to their products even if serious regulation became a reality. Simply put: the industry itself would cease to exist without salt, sugar, and fat.",1400069807,9781400069804),Hardcover,,480 pages,"

The “unparalleled romantic adventure”* of Nalini Singh’s New York Times bestselling series continues as a new dawn begins for the Psy-Changeling world...
The Psy-Changeling world has undergone a staggering transformation and now stands at a crossroads. The Trinity Accord promises a new era of cooperation between disparate races and groups. It is a beacon of hope held together by many hands: Old enemies. New allies. Wary loners.But a century of distrust and suspicion can’t be so easily forgotten and threatens to shatter Trinity from within at any moment. As rival members vie for dominance, chaos and evil gather in the shadows and a kidnapped woman’s cry for help washes up in San Francisco, while the Consortium turns its murderous gaze toward a child who is the embodiment of change, of love, of piercing hope: A child who is both Psy…and changeling.To find the lost, protect the vulnerable—and save Trinity—no one can stand alone. This is a time of loyalty across divisions, of bonds woven into the heart and the soul, of heroes known and unknown standing back to back and holding the line. But is an allegiance of honor even possible with traitors lurking in their midst?",1101987774,9781101987773),ebook,,478 pages,"

","Артур Бертон - молод, полон свободолюбивых идей и романтических иллюзий. Пережив предательство товарищей и любимой женщины - потеряв всё, он исчезает, чтобы вернуться совсем иным, с чужим именем и внешностью. Но под маской возмужавшего, насмешливого и едкого Овода - все тот же порывистый Артур, по-прежнему верный прекрасным идеалам своей юности. Романтика национально-освободительной борьбы, трагедия великой, страстной и несчастной любви, увлекательный сюжет с захватывающей интригой и необычайно многогранный и обаятельный образ главного героя, - все это позволило роману ""Овод"" стать неподвластным времени.",,,Paperback,,351 pages,"

","Pulitzer Prize Winner (1998)In American Pastoral, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all the twentieth century's promises of prosperity, civic order, and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Seymour 'Swede' Levov—a legendary high school athlete, a devoted family man, a hard worker, the prosperous inheritor of his father's Newark glove factory—comes of age in thriving, triumphant post-war America. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager—a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longed-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece.",,,Kindle Edition,,435 pages,"

","The backstory that fans have been clamoring for—how Rock and Trisha fell in love—is the final novel in the Sea Breeze series from New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author Abbi Glines.Trisha Corbin always knew how to hide a bruise. With her momma’s boyfriends unable to keep their hands off her, she had no choice. And as long as it meant the guys wouldn’t go near her little brother, Krit, it was worth it. But her days of dreaming that Prince Charming would ever come rescue her are far, far in the past. Rock Taylor always had a plan. Through football, he would rise above the life he was born into. A full scholarship to play for a major college team was within his reach—assuming he didn’t let anything get in his way. But scoring a date with the hottest girl in Sea Breeze was proving harder than expected. Trisha Corbin was every man’s walking fantasy, and she wouldn’t even glance his way. When Rock finally does get Trisha in his truck, it isn’t for a date. It’s because he picks her up on the side of the road, beaten and bruised and trying to get to the local hospital. Before Rock knows it, football is no longer his life. Trisha Corbin is. And he’ll do anything to save her. And keep her. In addition to Rock and Trisha’s love story, this special conclusion to the Sea Breeze series contains the wrap-up stories of all your favorite Sea Breeze couples: Sadie and Jax, Marcus and Low, Cage and Eva, Preston and Amanda, Jess and Jason, Krit and Blythe, and Dewayne and Sienna.

","Una cittadina sul mare, un sentimento che nasce prepotente, il sogno realizzato. L'amore trovato e poi perduto, e la scelta che nessuno vorrebbe mai dover compiere. Travis Parker è un giovane veterinario del South Carolina e la vita gli sorride: ha un lavoro appassionante, una villetta affacciata sull'oceano, un cane affettuoso e instancabile, dei cari vecchi amici e fascino da vendere; ma ha anche la convinzione di non essere destinato alle relazioni a lungo termine. Qualcosa cambia nel suo cuore quando Gabby Holland, assistente medico in una clinica pediatrica, e Molly, la sua dolce collie, si trasferiscono nella casa accanto. Il primo incontro è burrascoso: Molly aspetta i cuccioli e la sua padrona incolpa il boxer del suo vicino. Eppure l'attrazione è forte e lentamente Travis riesce a conquistare la diffidente e fidanzatissima Gabby; pian piano i due si avvicinano, fino a rendersi conto di non poter fare a meno l'uno dell'altra. Un giorno, però, accade l'irreparabile e la vita di Travis subisce una drammatica svolta. Straziato dal dolore e dal rimorso, e dilaniato dai dubbi, per settimane continua a domandarsi: fino a che punto si deve arrivare per amore?

","“Back to Planet Hoola”, written by Author Sudipta Das, is a Sci Fi (Science Fiction) book with philosophical and spiritual tinges, and the author’s wonderful realisations embedded in an alien plot of divine aspirations, evil desires, intrigue, wisdom and love.In this sequel to the Author’s internationally published and globally presented debut fiction, The Asylum Dweller’s Diary, there are imaginative, interesting and insightful stories within the storyline, serving you with food for thought.Things that are too far away for the eyes to see, have to be brought closer with a telescope. Conversely, things that are too near and attached and, therefore, defy perception, may become perceptible with detachment from a distance, putting aside the stereotypes thrust by the external world upon the internal psyche. Kit, the protagonist, takes his friend Doctor Adam Smith, the narrator, to this alien planet Hoola, millions of light years away from Earth. Hoola is a unique multi-coloured planet, and so is the alien Hoo race that lives on it. Kit vows to harmonise the Hoo race fragmented by their colour differences. The odds are heavily against him.A Sword of honour has to be recovered from the enemy. Ages old anomalies have to be set right. Kit’s unifying efforts inevitably produce ugly reactions from the divisive forces. He is abducted by a ruthless cunning despot. Death is the order for Kit. What happens then?In the end, was it all Doctor Adam’s dream or did he actually visit the planet Hoola?",,,ebook,First Edition,127 pages,"

From his deathbed, Charles III’s viceroy, Anielo de Guzmán y Carafa, marquis of Castle Rodrigo, names his wife as his successor. Eleanora de Moura is a highly intelligent and capable woman who immediately applies her political acumen to heal the scarred soul of Palermo, a city afflicted by poverty, misery and the frequent uprisings they entail. The Marquise implements measures that include lowering the price of bread, reducing taxes for large families, re-opening women’s care facilities, and establishing stipends for young couples wishing to marry—all measures that were considered seditious by the conservative city fathers and by the Church. The machinations of powerful men soon result in Donna Eleanora, whom the Church sees as a dangerous revolutionary, being recalled to Spain. Her rule lasted one cycle of the moon.Based on a true story, Camilleri’s gripping novel tells the story of a woman whose courage and political vision is tested at every step by misogyny and reactionary conservatism.""",,,Kindle Edition,,208 pages,"

","Jonathan Safran Foer emerged as one of the most original writers of his generation with his best-selling debut novel, Everything Is Illuminated. Now, with humor, tenderness, and awe, he confronts the traumas of our recent history. What he discovers is solace in that most human quality, imagination. 	Meet Oskar Schell, an inventor, Francophile, tambourine player, Shakespearean actor, jeweler, pacifist, correspondent with Stephen Hawking and Ringo Starr. He is nine years old. And he is on an urgent, secret search through the five boroughs of New York. His mission is to find the lock that fits a mysterious key belonging to his father, who died in the World Trade Center on 9/11.An inspired innocent, Oskar is alternately endearing, exasperating, and hilarious as he careens from Central Park to Coney Island to Harlem on his search. Along the way he is always dreaming up inventions to keep those he loves safe from harm. What about a birdseed shirt to let you fly away? What if you could actually hear everyone's heartbeat? His goal is hopeful, but the past speaks a loud warning in stories of those who've lost loved ones before. As Oskar roams New York, he encounters a motley assortment of humanity who are all survivors in their own way. He befriends a 103-year-old war reporter, a tour guide who never leaves the Empire State Building, and lovers enraptured or scorned. Ultimately, Oskar ends his journey where it began, at his father's grave. But now he is accompanied by the silent stranger who has been renting the spare room of his grandmother's apartment. They are there to dig up his father's empty coffin.",0618329706,9780618329700),Hardcover,,356 pages,"

","When sixteen-year-old Alfred Rosenberg is called into his headmaster’s office for anti-Semitic remarks he made during a school speech, he is forced, as punishment, to memorize passages about Spinoza from the autobiography of the German poet Goethe. Rosenberg is stunned to discover that Goethe, his idol, was a great admirer of the Jewish seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Long after graduation, Rosenberg remains haunted by this “Spinoza problem”: how could the German genius Goethe have been inspired by a member of a race Rosenberg considers so inferior to his own, a race he was determined to destroy?Spinoza himself was no stranger to punishment during his lifetime. Because of his unorthodox religious views, he was excommunicated from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656, at the age of twenty-four, and banished from the only world he had ever known. Though his life was short and he lived without means in great isolation, he nonetheless produced works that changed the course of history. Over the years, Rosenberg rose through the ranks to become an outspoken Nazi ideologue, a faithful servant of Hitler, and the main author of racial policy for the Third Reich. Still, his Spinoza obsession lingered. By imagining the unexpected intersection of Spinoza’s life with Rosenberg’s, internationally bestselling novelist Irvin D. Yalom explores the mindsets of two men separated by 300 years. Using his skills as a psychiatrist, he explores the inner lives of Spinoza, the saintly secular philosopher, and of Rosenberg, the godless mass murderer.",0465029639,9780465029631),Hardcover,,321 pages,"

","Following ""The Rotters' Club ""and its sequel, ""The Closed Circle, ""Jonathan Coe now offers his first stand-alone novel in a decade, a story of three generations of women whose destinies reach from the English countryside in World War II to London, Toronto, and southern France at the turn of the new century.Evacuated to Shropshire during the Blitz, eight-year-old Rosamond forged a bond with her cousin Beatrix that augured the most treasured and devastating moments of her life. She recorded these memories sixty years later, just before her death, on cassettes she bequeathed to a woman she hadn't seen in decades. When her beloved niece, Gill, plays the tapes in hopes of locating this unwitting heir, she instead hears a family saga swathed in promise and betrayal: the story of how Beatrix, starved of her mother's affection, conceived a fraught bloodline that culminated in heart-stopping tragedy--its chief victim being her own granddaughter. And as Rosamond explores the ties that bound these generations together and shaped her experience all along, Gill grows increasingly haunted by how profoundly her own recollections--not to mention the love she feels for her grown daughters, listening alongside her--are linked to generations of women she never knew.A stirring, masterful portrait of motherhood and family secrets, ""The Rain Before It Falls"" is also a meditation on the tapestries we weave out of the past, whether transcendent or horrific. Hailed by the ""Los Angeles Times"" for his ""sustained, intricate brilliance,"" Jonathan Coe once again proves himself ""an artist of character and of his characters' stories,"" here more astutely than ever before.",0670917281,9780670917280),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

Having completed countless phenomenal feature films, TV series, live extravaganzas and radio voice-overs since then, Rik Mayall is now poised on the brink of a whole new epoch-shattering revolution.For the first time ever, Rik reveals in print the deep inner truth behind his gargantuan ascent to the pinnacle of international light entertainment – the mental hospitals he has broken out of, the television executives he has assaulted, the drugs he has definitely not taken, the charities he has bankrupted, the countless pregnancies he has engendered, and so much more.",000720728X,9780007207282),Paperback,,352 pages,"

Azt majd holnap veszem fel.”Ezzel a párbeszéddel indul két kislány életre szóló barátsága az ötvenes években, és hamarosan elválaszthatatlan társuk lesz egy harmadik is, akivel a poros amerikai kisváros közismert trióját alkotják. Évtizedekkel később még mindig törzsasztaluk van Earl mindenki által kedvelt, Amennyi beléd fér nevű vendéglőjében.Itt ebédel – családostul – a vasárnapi istentiszteletek után a három, immár középkorú barátnő is: a különös képességekkel bíró Odette, Clarice, a háziasszonyok gyöngye és a gyönyörű Barbara Jean. Már mindhárman megtalálták lelki nyugalmukat, de nem akármilyen éveken vannak túl. Hogy mi történt velük és Amerikával a megelőző évtizedekben, azt fergeteges humorral beszéli el a szerző, aki úgy mesél emberi gyarlóságokról és érzelmekről, hogy közben minden figurát megért és szeret.

","In his four-volume series Return to Nevèrÿon, Hugo and Nebula award-winner Samuel R. Delany appropriated the conceits of sword-and-sorcery fantasy to explore his characteristic themes of language, power, gender, and the nature of civilization. Wesleyan University Press has reissued the long-unavailable Nevèrÿon volumes in trade paperback. The eleven stories, novellas, and novels in Return to Nevèrÿon's four volumes chronicle a long-ago land on civilization's brink, perhaps in Asia or Africa, or even on the Mediterranean. Taken slave in childhood, Gorgik gains his freedom, leads a slave revolt, and becomes a minister of state, finally abolishing slavery. Ironically, however, he is sexually aroused by the iron slave collars of servitude. Does this contaminate his mission - or intensify it? Presumably elaborated from an ancient text of unknown geographical origin, the stories are sunk in translators' and commentators' introductions and appendices, forming a richly comic frame.",081956270X,9780819562708),Paperback,,260 pages,"

Carter's town becomes a giant glittery set and, much to her annoyance, everyone is starry-eyed for Adam. Carter seems to be the only girl not falling all over herself to get a glimpse of him.

","A vivid and compelling story of love, war and secrets, set against the backdrop of WWI France. 'In the beginning, it was the summers I remembered - long warm days under the palest blue skies, the cornflowers and forget-me-nots lining the road through the Lys forest, the buzz of insects going about their work, Violet telling me lies.' Iris is getting old. A widow, her days are spent living quietly and worrying about her granddaughter, Grace, a headstrong young doctor. It's a small sort of life. But one day an invitation comes for Iris through the post to a reunion in France, where she served in a hospital during WWI. Determined to go, Iris is overcome by the memories of the past, when as a shy, naive young woman she followed her fifteen-year-old brother, Tom, to France in 1914 intending to bring him home. On her way to find Tom, Iris comes across the charismatic Miss Ivens, who is setting up a field hospital in the old abbey of Royaumont, north of Paris. Putting her fears aside, Iris decides to stay at Royaumont, and it is there that she truly comes of age, finding her capability and her strength, discovering her passion for medicine, making friends with the vivacious Violet and falling in love. But war is a brutal thing, and when the ultimate tragedy happens, there is a terrible price that Iris has to pay, a price that will echo down the generations.

","Inghilterra, 1959. Dall'interno di un tetro manicomio criminale vittoriano uno psichiatra comincia a esporre, con apparente distacco, il caso clinico più perturbante che abbia incontrato nella sua carriera – la passione letale fra Stella Raphael, moglie di un altro psichiatra dell'ospedale, e Edgar Stark, un artista detenuto per un uxoricidio particolarmente efferato. È una vicenda cupa e tormentosa, che fin dalle prime righe esercita su di noi una malìa talmente forte da risultare quasi incomprensibile – finché lentamente non ne affiorano le ragioni nascoste. «Emersi da una lettura che probabilmente avrà avuto poche interruzioni – senza ricorrere a sensazionalismi plateali, McGrath è un maestro nel­l'arte di non mollare la presa – ci si potrà domandare semmai in che categoria collocare questo libro avvincente ...

Bilinmeyen Bir Kadının Mektubu’nun kadın kahramanını sadece uzun bir mektubun yazarı olarak tanıyoruz. Kadının hayatı boyunca sevmiş olduğu erkek için kaleme aldığı bu mektubun “gönderen”inin adı yoktur. Mektubun başında tek bir hitap vardır: “Sana, beni asla tanımamış olan sana”. Kadın büyük tutkusunu hep bir “bilinmeyen” olarak, yani tek başına yaşamaya razıdır, bu aşk öyküsünde “taraflar” değil, sadece tek bir “taraf” vardır. Böylesine, gerçek anlamda aşk denilebilir mi? Zweig okurunu, bir kez daha, insan psikolojisinde eşine pek rastlanmayan bir yolculuğa davet ediyor.

","“One night in early January, with dark clouds racing across a full moon that cast its ancient glow across the mountain top, they came. Clad in hooded black robes, carrying torches that blazed with evil fury, they came. With chanting—at first a distant murmur, then growing and building, louder and louder—incessant, demanding, hideous chanting, they came.Mother had been rocking both Jeremiah, my four-year-old little brother, and me on our rickety rocking chair, its swaying motion in itself a soothing comfort on a dark night. But more than that, mother sang to us in her clear and lilting voice as she often did, chasing away the ghosts and goblins that sometimes haunt a young boy’s mind. As I was about to drop off to sleep, the noise and the clatter from outside our cabin startled me back to consciousness. Mother’s voice mixed with the incessant chanting that came closer and closer. Her voice faded. We could see the lights from their torches through the window panes, and mother rose quickly from the rocker and hurried Jeremiah and me into our bedroom. She cautioned us in whispery tones to stay quiet, to stay in our room, pretend to be asleep; and then on tiptoe, she rushed out the door, closing it quietly after herself.Within minutes, I heard Mother scream a piercing wail that emitted both terror and defeat. They came through our bedroom door, robes rustling, wild eyes searching, hands reaching, and carried Jeremiah and I from our beds. They dragged Mother out the front door, through the dark forest, up the mountainside, our captors pulling my brother and I close behind. I remember the brittle sound of the fallen leaves under our feet, the cold chill of the night air brushing against my face, the pale moonlight frosting the tips of the last remaining leaves on the black, skeletal oak trees that rose above us. And we kept climbing, climbing, farther and farther up through the forest. And as we walked, a cold wind came up, turning the leaves; and the racing clouds changed into thunderheads. And then the first bolt of lightning lit the sky and illuminated the hellish scene around us—the shadowy, dark figures stomping through the bushes and underbrush, the swaying glow of lanterns through the trees. All the while their chanting reverberated across the landscape, mixing with the sound of the howling, barking, snarling, pawing dogs that followed in their midst.""",,,Kindle Edition,,241 pages,"

","Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad, was originally a three-part series in Blackwood's Magazine in 1899. It is a story within a story, following a character named Charlie Marlow, who recounts his adventure to a group of men onboard an anchored ship. The story told is of his early life as a ferry boat captain. Although his job was to transport ivory downriver, Charlie develops an interest in investing an ivory procurement agent, Kurtz, who is employed by the government. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in “one of the darkest places on earth.” Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.A reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, Heart of Darkness is considered one of the most influential works ever written.",,,Kindle Edition,,116 pages,"

Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. 
In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned – from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.Enter Mia Warren – an enigmatic artist and single mother – who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the alluring mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.When the Richardsons' friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town and puts Mia and Mrs. Richardson on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Mrs. Richardson becomes determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs to her own family – and Mia's. Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of long-held secrets and the ferocious pull of motherhood-and the danger of believing that planning and following the rules can avert disaster, or heartbreak.",,,Kindle Edition,,348 pages,"

","U ovome lirskom, maštovitom novom romanu, Elif Shafak razmatra dvije usporedne priče - jednu suvremenu i drugu smještenu u trinaesto stoljeće, kad je sufijski pjesnik i mistik Rumi susreo svog duhovnog mentora, derviša lutalicu poznatog kao Šems iz Tabriza. Obje priče zajedno utjelovljuju Rumijevu bezvremenu poruku ljubavi.Američka kućanica Ella Rubinstein ima četrdeset godina i u nesretnom je braku kad prihvaća posao recenzentice jednog književnog agenta. Njezin je prvi zadatak pročitati i izvijestiti o romanu naslovljenom Slatko bogohulje, kojeg je napisao muškarac po imenu Aziz Z. Zahara. Zaharin roman, ispričan u mnogo različitih glasova, priča o Šemsovoj potrazi za Rumijem i ulozi derviša u preobrazbi uspješnog, ali nesretnog svećenika u predanog mistika, strastvenog pjesnika i zagovornika ljubavi.Sve više opčinjena ovom pričom i sve se više udaljavajući od svog supruga, Ella počinje propitkivati svoj zaštićen, provincijski život i posezati za Azizom, koji živi u Amsterdamu. Ujedno je oduševljavaju Šemsova pravila ljubavi koja nude uvid u drevnu filozofiju temeljenu na jedinstvu svih naroda i vjera i nazočnosti ljubavi u svakome od nas. I dok Ella čita Azizov roman, shvaća da Rumijeva priča odražava njezinu vlastitu i da je Aziz - jednako kao Šems - došao osloboditi je, preobraziti je na način koji nikad ne bi mogla zamisliti.U Četrdeset pravila ljubavi, Elif Shafak isprela je čudesnu priču o ljubavi i duhovnoj čežnji, sjajno istražujući univerzalnu želju za prisnošću - s drugim ljudskim bićem kao i sa božanskim. Ovaj je roman provokativan u najboljem smislu te riječi, jedan od rijetkih koji uspijeva rasvijetliti mistične vidove svakodnevnog postojanja, roman uma koliko i srca, s mudrošcu koja prožima svaku stranicu.",9958301733,9789958301735),Paperback,Biblioteka Farah,425 pages,"

Následuje tragédie, která ji na dlouhá léta připoutá k nemluvné a depresivní tetě Haně a odhalí pohnutou rodinnou historii, jež nadále popluje s proudem jejího života jako ledová kra.Příběh, který vychází ze skutečných událostí, popisuje Alena Mornštajnová ve strhujícím tempu a se smyslem pro dramatičnost, až má čtenář pocit, že sleduje napínavý film. Zůstává jen otázka, zda se kra osudu nakonec přece jen rozpustí…",,,Hardcover,,306 pages,"

","- Sansürsüz Basım -Olağanüstü güzellikteki bir genç adamın, çekiciliğinden aldığı güçle zaman içinde yozlaşmasını anlatan Dorian Gray'irı Portresi, yayımlandığı zaman okurları da eleştirmenleri de derinden sarsmış ve Oscar Wilde isminin edebiyat tarihine kazınmasına neden olmuştur. Fakat günümüzdeki baskılarda temel alman metin, kitabın ilk olarak Lippincott's Monthly Magazine'de çıkan ve tepki çektiği için dergi editörleri ve ardından bizzat Wilde tarafından sansürlenen halidir.Nicholas Frankel'ın editörlüğünü yaptığı bu baskıda, Dorian Gray'in Portresi'nin 1890'da dergiye teslim edilen sansürsüz nüshası esas alındı. Böylece Dorian Gray'in hikâyesi, ""düzelti"" adı altında hoyratça yapılan budamalardan, ""ahlaksızca"" olduğu düşüncesiyle ""yumuşatılmış"" ifadelerden arındırılıp, ilk defa Wilde'ın asıl kurguladığı biçimiyle hayat bulmuş oldu.Oscar Wilde, kendisini romandaki Basil Hallward karakteriyle özdeşleştirdiğini, ancak aslında Dorian olmak istediğini söylemiş, ""Belki başka çağlarda,"" diye de eklemiştir. Yaşadığı çağda zulüm gören ve ""ahlak bozukluğundan"" hapse atılan Wilde'ın gotik öğeler taşıyan büyüleyici romanı Dorian Gray'in Portresi, bugün nihayet özgün hali ve Ülker İnce'nin, Dünya Kitap dergisi, 2014 ""Yılın Çeviri Kitabı Ödülü""nü alan Türkçesiyle okurların karşısına çıkıyor.",,,Paperback,,190 pages,"

","Ukryté hluboko v srdci Barcelony leží pohřebiště zapomenutých knih – labyrint tisíců ztracených, skrytých či odložených svazků. Sem je jednoho chladného rána roku 1945 přiveden desetiletý Daniel Sempere, aby si vybral jeden titul. Daniel zvolí román Stín větru záhadného autora Juliána Caraxe. Poutavá kniha a enigmatický spisovatel vyvolají v Danielovi touhu dozvědět se o nich něco víc, pátrání po jejich původu mu však záhy obrátí život naruby. Není totiž sám, kdo se o Caraxovo dílo zajímá – jednoho dne Daniela v křivolakých uličkách osloví muž, který nápadně připomíná postavu ze Stínu větru. Muž posedlý snahou vypátrat a zničit všechny výtisky této knihy. Danielova touha zjistit pravdu o Juliánovi se však rovněž změní v posedlost. Spletité osudy Daniela a Juliána se začnou protínat, až nakonec vytvoří složitý mnohavrstevný propletenec...Stín větru (2001), literární thriller s prvky historického, gotického i detektivního románu, se stal kultovním knižním fenoménem a celosvětovým bestsellerem vydaným ve více než 50 jazycích. Získal řadu ocenění a vyšel v milionových nákladech. Carlos Ruiz Zafón v něm poprvé uvedl čtenáře do magického světa série Pohřebiště zapomenutých knih – a učinil tak ještě třikrát, v prózách Andělská hra (2008), Nebeský vězeň (2011) a Labyrint duchů (2017).Obálku navrhla Soňa Šedivá.Vydání páté, v EMG (Knižní klub) druhé.",0142800805,9780142800805),Audio CD,Unabridged,16 pages,"

","451 градуса по Фаренхайт (на английски: Fahrenheit 451) е научно-фантастичен роман — антиутопия от Рей Бредбъри, издаден през 1953 г.Името на романа идва от химическото свойство на хартията да се самозапалва при температура 451 градуса по Фаренхайт (232,78 градуса по Целзий).Романът описва тоталитарно общество, което насърчава масовата култура и потребителското мислене, а книгите са забранени и подлежат на изгаряне.

His real problem is not the enemy - it is his own army which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. If Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions then he is caught in Catch-22: if he flies he is crazy, and doesn't have to; but if he doesn't want to he must be sane and has to.

","After a life of passion and adventure that has brought her through slavery to the Resurrection garden, through the controversies of the Early Church to a hermit cave in southern Gaul, Maeve, the Celtic Mary Magdalen, returns to the Holy Isles accompanied by Sarah, her daughter with Jesus. Their mission: to find Maeve's first-born child, stolen from her by the druids more than forty years ago.Since then, Maeve's homeland has suffered it's own trials--Roman invasion and occupation. The Celtic tribes to the east and south are under direct rule, and the Romans are determined to rout the resistance of the western tribes, resistance fueled by the druids of Mona. Just before she crosses the channel from Gaul to Britain, Maeve encounters a man she mistakes for Jesus's ghost. This familiar stranger is equally haunted, and the two are drawn into a moonstruck liason that will entwine their lives in ""an impossible Celtic knot."" For unbeknownst to Maeve at the time, he is none other than General Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, the newly-appointed Roman Governor of Britain.Maeve keeps this troubling tryst a secret even after she finds her long-lost daughter Boudica, the fierce and charismatic queen of the Iceni tribe. Druid-trained in her youth, Boudica married the Iceni king, hoping to rally him to a rebellion for which he has no stomach. Now estranged from her husband, Boudica keeps the old ways, sustained by her pride in her descent form her father (and Maeve's!) the late great druid Lovernios.Seeking to circumvent disaster, Maeve travels back and forth from Iceni country to Mona, from the heart of native resistance to a Roman fort on the Western front, steadfast in her conviction: ""Love is as strong as death.""",0982324693,9780982324691),Hardcover,,297 pages,"

The following evening, Ackroyd is murdered in his locked study--but not before receiving a letter identifying the widow's blackmailer. King's Abbot is crawling with suspects, including a nervous butler, Ackroyd's wayward stepson, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd, who has taken up residence in the victim's home.

","One of William Faulkner’s most admired and accessible novels, Light in August reveals the great American author at the height of his powers. Lena Grove’s resolute search for the father of her unborn child begets a rich, poignant, and ultimately hopeful story of perseverance in the face of mortality. It also acquaints us with several of Faulkner’s most unforgettable characters, including the Reverend Gail Hightower, plagued by visions of Confederate horsemen, and Joe Christmas, a ragged, itinerant soul obsessed with his mixed-race ancestry. Powerfully entwining these characters’ stories, Light in August brings to life Faulkner’s imaginary South, one of literature’s great invented landscapes, in all of its unerringly fascinating glory. Along with a new Foreword by C. E. Morgan, this edition reproduces the corrected text of Light in August as established in 1985 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk.",067964248X,9780679642480),Hardcover,,460 pages,"

At that time, the 'Oms, the Inhabitants of the Shadows, still lived in their fortified cities. But the ramparts of the Night were closing in on them, terrifying them and swallowing them up. And yet, among the Shadows, dreams gradually rose up in the form of primitive beings that became known as the ""Others.""

","What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective? Politics Out of History is animated by the question of how we navigate the contemporary political landscape when the traditional compass points of modernity have all but disappeared. Wendy Brown diagnoses a range of contemporary political tendencies--from moralistic high-handedness to low-lying political despair in politics, from the difficulty of formulating political alternatives to reproaches against theory in intellectual life--as the consequence of this disorientation.Politics Out of History also presents a provocative argument for a new approach to thinking about history--one that forsakes the idea that history has a purpose and treats it instead as a way of illuminating openings in the present by, for example, identifying the haunting and constraining effects of past injustices unresolved. Brown also argues for a revitalized relationship between intellectual and political life, one that cultivates the autonomy of each while promoting their interlocutory potential. This book will be essential reading for all who find the trajectories of contemporary liberal democracies bewildering and are willing to engage readings of a range of thinkers--Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin, Derrida--to rethink democratic possibility in our time.",0691070857,9780691070858),Paperback,,193 pages,"

","As meticulously researched as all of Brooks' previous work, People of the Book is a gripping and moving novel about war, art, love and survival.When Hanna Heath gets a call in the middle of the night in her Sydney home about a precious medieval manuscript that has been recovered from the smouldering ruins of war-torn Sarajevo, she knows she is on the brink of the experience of a lifetime. A renowned book conservator, she must now make her way to Bosnia to start work on restoring the Sarajevo Haggadah - a Jewish prayer book - to discover its secrets and piece together the story of its miraculous survival. But the trip will also set in motion a series of events that threaten to rock Hanna's orderly life, including her encounter with Ozren Karamen, the young librarian who risked his life to save the book.

Tanto um como o outro dariam um excelente marido.Por vezes, apaixonamo-nos pela pessoa que seria perfeita para nós...Outras vezes, não.Há apenas um Rokesby que Billie não tolera de forma alguma: George.

Ainda por cima, o ódio é mútuo, algo que lhe convém na perfeição.Mas, por vezes, o Destino tem um sentido de humor perverso...Pois quando Billie e George ficarem a sós… (certamente no mais inusitado dos locais!) e os seus lábios relutantes finalmente se unirem num beijo, os dois poderão vir a descobrir que a pessoa que não suportam pode bem ser aquela sem a qual não conseguem viver.Os fãs dos Bridgerton – para os quais o fim da saga foi o fim do mundo – têm agora uma nova razão para viver.

He constantly has to keep an eye on the fearless Quinn, whose thrill-seeking sometimes goes too far. But the stakes get higher when Blake has to chase Quinn into a bizarre phantom carnival that traps its customers forever.In order to escape, Blake must survive seven deadly rides by dawn, each of which represents a deep, personal fear -- from a carousel of stampeding animals to a hall of mirrors that changes people into their deformed reflections. Blake ultimately has to face up to a horrible secret from his own past to save himself and his brother -- that is, if the carnival doesn't claim their souls first!",1416997482,9781416997481),Paperback,,201 pages,"

He wore a once-black jumper and a pair of shiny tracksuit bottoms. The back of his head was cracked and his hair matted, but it had been foxy before that.

One messy murder affects the lives of five misfits who exist on the fringes of Ireland's post-crash society.

Georgie is a prostitute whose willingness to feign a religious conversion has dangerous repercussions, while Maureen, the accidental murderer, has returned to Cork after forty years in exile to discover that Jimmy, the son she was forced to give up years before, has grown into the most fearsome gangster in the city. In seeking atonement for the murder and a multitude of other perceived sins, Maureen threatens to destroy everything her son has worked so hard for, while her actions risk bringing the intertwined lives of the Irish underworld into the spotlight...Biting, moving and darkly funny, The Glorious Heresies explores salvation, shame and the legacy of Ireland's twentieth-century attitudes to sex and family.",144479888X,9781444798883),Paperback,,371 pages,"

","Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, a novel of large beauty and power, creates a magical world out of four generations of black life in America, a world we enter on the day of the birth of Macon Dead, Jr. (known as Milkman), son of the richest black family in a mid-western town; the day on which the lonely insurance man, Robert Smith, poised in blue silk wings, attempts to fly from a steeple of the hospital, a black Icarus looking homeward...We see Milkman growing up in his father's money-haunted, death-haunted house with his silent sisters and strangely passive mother, beginning to move outward--through his profound love and combat with his friend Guitar...through Guitar's mad and loving commitment to the secret avengers called the Seven Days...through Milkman's exotic, imprisoning affair with his love-blind cousin, Hagar...and through his unconscious apprenticeship to his mystical Aunt Pilate, who saved his life before he was born.And we follow him as he strikes out alone; moving first toward adventure and then--as the unspoken truth about his family and his own buried heritage announces itself--toward an adventurous and crucial embrace of life.This is a novel that expresses, with passion, tenderness, and a magnificence of language, the mysterious primal essence of family bond and conflict, the feelings and experience of all people wanting, and striving, to be alive.",0394497848,9780394497846),Hardcover,,337 pages,"

Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing - not even a smear of blood - to show that a boy has died.

Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon.

","This wise, stirring book argues that the search for meaning can immeasurably deepen our lives and is far more fulfilling than the pursuit of personal happiness.There is a myth in our culture that the search for meaning is some esoteric pursuit that you have to travel to a distant monastery or page through dusty volumes to figure out life s great secret. The truth is, there are untapped sources of meaning all around us right here, right now. Drawing on the latest research in positive psychology; on insights from George Eliot, Viktor Frankl, Aristotle, the Buddha, and other great minds; and on interviews with seekers of meaning, Emily Esfahani Smith lays out the four pillars upon which meaning rests. Belonging We all need to find our tribe and forge relationships in which we feel understood, recognized, and valued to know we matter to others.Purpose We all need a far-reaching goal that motivates us, serves as the organizing principle of our lives, and drives us to make a contribution to the world.Storytelling We are all storytellers, taking our disparate experiences and assembling them into a coherent narrative that allows us to make sense of ourselves and the world. Transcendence During a transcendent or mystical experience, we feel we have risen above the everyday world and are connected to something vast and meaningful. To bring those concepts to life, Smith visits a tight-knit fishing village on the Chesapeake Bay, stargazes in West Texas, attends a dinner where young people gather to share their experiences of untimely loss, and more. And she explores how we might begin to build a culture of meaning in our schools, our workplaces, and our communities. Inspiring and story-driven, The Power of Meaning will strike a profound chord in anyone seeking a richer, more satisfying life.""",0553419994,9780553419993),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

These women who admit to numerous affairs with younger men between the ages of nineteen to twenty-seven have had life to live behind the curtains.""I always feel like their teacher - like I was really contributing something to them - and that's probably why I come so great with them."" A psychologist, faculty member at a named College in California mentioned: ""These affairs were once traditional among some cultures, and still are to a large degree. The reason? Well, there are many, some peculiar to the individuals involved which limits any generalizations, but I would say there are some basic reasons that are involved in some manner in most of these cases.""For the women - they feel effective with the young, even 'powerful' with some elements of maternalism expressed through this manifestation.” And for the young men; consciously, the mature woman is a 'safe' yet desirable partner, while on the unconscious level they are serving Oedipal leanings."" ""Because they're the easiest to make - nothing's involved except being ready when she is. And not getting caught!"" the young men would say.""…they are going to be so hurt by the world that they need my love now.""

","Hailed by The Comics Journal as one of Europe’s most important and innovative comics artists, David B. has created a masterpiece in Epileptic, his stunning and emotionally resonant autobiography about growing up with an epileptic brother. Epileptic gathers together and makes available in English for the first time all six volumes of the internationally acclaimed graphic work.David B. was born Pierre-François Beauchard in a small town near Orléans, France. He spent an idyllic early childhood playing with the neighborhood kids and, along with his older brother, Jean-Christophe, ganging up on his little sister, Florence. But their lives changed abruptly when Jean-Christophe was struck with epilepsy at age eleven. In search of a cure, their parents dragged the family to acupuncturists and magnetic therapists, to mediums and macrobiotic communes. But every new cure ended in disappointment as Jean-Christophe, after brief periods of remission, would only get worse.Angry at his brother for abandoning him and at all the quacks who offered them false hope, Pierre-François learned to cope by drawing fantastically elaborate battle scenes, creating images that provide a fascinating window into his interior life. An honest and horrifying portrait of the disease and of the pain and fear it sowed in the family, Epileptic is also a moving depiction of one family’s intricate history. Through flashbacks, we are introduced to the stories of Pierre-François’s grandparents and we relive his grandfathers’ experiences in both World Wars. We follow Pierre-François through his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, all the while charting his complicated relationship with his brother and Jean-Christophe”s losing battle with epilepsy. Illustrated with beautiful and striking black-and-white images, Epileptic is as astonishing, intimate, and heartbreaking as the best literary memoir.From the Hardcover edition.",0375714685,9780375714689),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","For Jews in Nazi-occupied Paris, nowhere is safe. So when Odette Meyer’s father is sent to a Nazi work camp, Odette’s mother takes desperate measures to protect her, sending Odette deep into the French countryside. There, Odette pretends to be a peasant girl, even posing as a Christian–and attending Catholic masses–with other children. But inside, she is burning with secrets, and when the war ends Odette must figure out whether she can resume life in Paris as a Jew, or if she’s lost the connection to her former life forever. Inspired by the life of the real Odette Meyer, this moving free-verse novel is a story of triumph over adversity.",159990750X,9781599907505),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","The story takes place in Marseilles. Marseilles is a poor city in the South of France. It is a gate to Europe coming through the sea from North Africa. It was created more than 2000 years ago by Greek settlers coming from the town of Phocea, now on the Turkish coast.Marseilles is today famous in Europe as a city of corruption and violence.In this city was born an insane poet Antonin Artaud who wrote amazing books in the first part of the XXth century and is studied everywhere nowadays. However Artaud went mad and spent about ten years in an asylum in the last part of his life, all through WWII. Treated through intensive electroshock, he remained toothless after that.Artaud is being referenced in the book by the nickname that his mother gave him as a child “Nanaqui,” which is also the one he uses in his own writing.In this tale, Nanaqui comes back from the dead to visit us, with his companion Ivan (the Narrator). He is as obscene, crude, maniac, and delirious as a living dead could be. He meets a witch, Sarah, who drops by Marseilles on the way to the film festival of Cannes. Nanaqui wants to have an affair with her, but it turns out that she prefers a penguin to him (the penguin turns out to be gay actually).The story could be read as a modern tale taking place in the blazing heat of Marseilles, by the Mediterranean Sea, a shore haunted by hundreds of years of decaying civilizations, and through Nanaqui, our hero by the spirit of both greatness and madness.Warning: This book contains adult content, minimal punctuation, explicit language and is not suited for those below 18 years.+",,,ebook,,,"

","Juliet Marillier's intensely romantic first novel Daughter of the Forest takes the reader to an Ireland on the edge where history and fairy tale meet. Sorcha, seventh child of a seventh son, finds herself caught up in the manipulations of a wicked and sorcerous stepmother, the whims of faerie and the purely human evil of a fanatical British lord. Acts of kindness have the most terrible of consequences and people's strongest virtues are used against them. First volume of a trilogy, Daughter of the Forest is a stunning debut that takes one of the most moving of fairy stories and renders it in vivid painful detail--rarely have the day-to-day consequences of magic's demands been made so directly unpleasant. Sorcha is a figure of fortitude to stand with the great heroines of contemporary fantasy; she does what she has to and takes the consequences at every turn. The author creates a cast of worthy allies and enemies for Sorcha as she travels from a remote Irish fortress to the depths of a forest in a Britain caught between its Celtic and European identities. --Roz Kaveney",0006483984,9780006483984),Paperback,,662 pages,"

Greek ships decay, men languish, exhausted, and behind the walls of Troy a desperate people await the next turn of fate.This is the Iliad: an ancient story of enduring power; magnetic characters defined by stirring and momentous speeches; a panorama of human lives locked in a heroic struggle beneath a mischievous or indifferent heaven. Above all, this is a tale of the devastation, waste and pity of war.Caroline Alexander's virtuoso translation captures the rhythms and energy of Homer's original Greek while making the text as accessible as possible to a modern reader, accompanied by extensive extra material to provide a background to the poem.The result of 3,000 years of story-telling, Homer’s epic tale of the fall of Troy has resonated with every age and every human conflict: this is the Iliad at its most electrifying and vital.",1784870579,9781784870577),Paperback,,608 pages,"

Their father, Saboor, is constantly in search of work and they struggle together through poverty and brutal winters. To Abdullah, Pari - as beautiful and sweet-natured as the fairy for which she was named - is everything. More like a parent than a brother, Abdullah will do anything for her, even trading his only pair of shoes for a feather for her treasured collection. Each night they sleep together in their cot, their heads touching, their limbs tangled. One day the siblings journey across the desert to Kabul with their father. Pari and Abdullah have no sense of the fate that awaits them there, for the event which unfolds will tear their lives apart; sometimes a finger must be cut to save the hand. Crossing generations and continents, moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos, with profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion, Khaled Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways in which we help our loved ones in need, how the choices we make resonate through history and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.",,,Kindle Edition,,416 pages,"

Most people wouldn't think of a bad Santa case as the perfect Christmas gift. Then again, Molly Malone, office manager at Hunt Investigations, isn't most people, and she could really use a distraction from the fantasies she's been having since spending the night with her very secret crush, Lucas Knight. Nothing happened, not that Lucas knows that — but Molly just wants to enjoy being a little naughty for once...Whiskey and pain meds for almost-healed bullet wounds don't mix. Lucas needs to remember that next time he's shot on the job, which may be sooner rather than later if Molly's brother, Joe, finds out about them. Lucas can't believe he's drawing a blank on his (supposedly) passionate tryst with Molly, who's the hottest, smartest, strongest woman he's ever known. Strong enough to kick his butt if she discovers he's been assigned to babysit her on her first case.

","In one of the most influential philosophical works ever writer, John Stuart Mill explores the risks and responsibilities of liberty. Examining the tyranny that can come both from government and from the herd-like opinion of the majority, Mill proposes a freedom to think, unite, and pursue our pleasures as the most important freedoms, as long as we cause no harm to others. GREAT IDEAS. Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves - and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives - and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.",0141046945,9780141046945),Paperback,,168 pages,"

","Time is a resource. Everyone knows it has to be managed.And on the Discworld that is the job of the Monks of History, who store it and pump it from the places where it's wasted (like the underwater - how much time does a codfish need?) to places like cities, where there's never enough time.But the construction of the world's first truly accurate clock starts a race against, well, time for Lu Tze and his apprentice Lobsang Ludd. Because it will stop time. And that will only be the start of everyone's problems.THIEF OF TIME comes complete with a full supporting cast of heroes, villains, yetis, martial artists and Ronnie, the fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse (who left before they became famous).",0552148407,9780552148405),Paperback,,430 pages,"

","From the author of Three Souls comes a vividly imagined and haunting new novel set in early 20th century Shanghai—a story of friendship, heartbreak, and history that follows a young Eurasian orphan’s search for her long-lost mother.That night I dreamed that I had wandered out to Dragon Springs Road all on my own, when a dreadful knowledge seized me that my mother had gone away never to return . . . In 1908, Jialing is only seven years old when she is abandoned in the courtyard of a once-lavish estate outside Shanghai. Jialing is zazhong—Eurasian—and faces a lifetime of contempt from both Chinese and Europeans. Until now she’s led a secluded life behind courtyard walls, but without her mother’s protection, she can survive only if the estate’s new owners, the Yang family, agree to take her in.Jialing finds allies in Anjuin, the eldest Yang daughter, and Fox, an animal spirit who has lived in the courtyard for centuries. But Jialing’s life as the Yangs’ bondservant changes unexpectedly when she befriends a young English girl who then mysteriously vanishes.Murder, political intrigue, jealousy, forbidden love … Jialing confronts them all as she grows into womanhood during the tumultuous early years of the Chinese republic, always hopeful of finding her long-lost mother. Through every turn she is guided, both by Fox and by her own strength of spirit, away from the shadows of her past toward a very different fate, if she has the courage to accept it.",0062388959,9780062388957),Paperback,,367 pages,"

","Una fría mañana de noviembre, tras un penoso viaje en barco, el señor Linh desembarca en un país que podría ser Francia, donde no conoce a nadie y cuya lengua ignora. El señor Linh huye de una guerra que le ha robado todo menos a su nieta, un bebé llamado Sang Diu. Instalado en un piso de acogida, el señor Linh sólo se preocupa por ella, su única razón de existir hasta que conoce al señor Bark, un hombre robusto y afable. Un afecto espontáneo surge entre estos dos solitarios que, capaces de comprenderse en silencio, se encuentran regularmente en un banco del parque. Pero una mañana, los servicios sociales conducen al señor Linh a un hospicio que no está autorizado a abandonar. El coraje y la determinación del anciano conducirán a un inesperado desenlace, profundamente conmovedor.Una exquisita fábula sobre el exilio y la soledad o, lo que es lo mismo, la lucha por preservar la identidad.

","Many novels have traced ""the history of a young woman's heart,"" but never better than the original. The favorite book of many readers and still one of the bestselling classic novels of all time, Jane Eyre continues to enthrall readers young and old. Charlotte Brontë was born in 1816 and died in 1855. Her most famous book was published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell, to hide Charlotte Brontë's gender in an era when female authors were taken less seriously. This text follows the 1848 edition, which incorporated the final changes approved by Charlotte Brontë and includes reviews written at the time of Jane Eyre's sensational first publication. The stunning cover design is a paper cut illustration by artist Petra Börner, whose clients include Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Louis Vuitton, Penguin, Random House, the Guardian, and the Independent.",0142500909,9780142500903),Paperback,,643 pages,"

","The awakening of brainwashed minds is a slow and delicate process but, must be done. An estimate of 500 years of physical and mental slavery is long enough but, takes time to restore.The Spirit of Slavery has severed the soul of POC (People of Color) in many ways. One could only imagine how the heinous and despicable conditions people who were enslaved endured would affect the Minds and the Self-Worth of a person of Africa Descent for many centuries.Generations being held hostage emotionally and spiritually prohibiting progress of self-determination.This book will not shrink from the task of detailing perhaps some of these awful, painful criminal acts and circumstances connected to chattel slavery in efforts to finally help others somewhat understand the depths of the evil inflicted on generations of people of color psyche.In hopes to perhaps, promote awareness of these past evils that no one speaks about, that inhibits a desire for self-awareness self-healing, self-love, self-worth and self-determination within the hearts of POC.It is past time for people of Africa descent to heal from the Social effects of the negative energies that were attached to chattel Slavery.Including but, not limited to understanding the effects of the text within the Willie Lynch Letter depicting the mental and emotional bondage inflicted on POC with the evil intent of perpetuating the residual effects of Slavery for generations to come.The effect of Stockholm syndrome operating in the minds of many today perhaps prohibits the healing process of POC to develop Self-Love, Self-Worth and self-determination.This may be one of the last generations that are willing, able and ready to THINK their way out of this mental and emotional bondage of the Residual Effects of Slavery and actually thrive for mental and emotional freedoms. Rally, March or Petition if you will but, nothing is going to change until your mind changes. Change only happens on the inside but, will manifest on the outside.Some have thought POC would've been further along, in society than what they appear to be today. But, many know why the progress of a people seems stifled. Perhaps, loving self is the only justice one must seek that will build enough courage and confident to finally once and for all break free.

","This beautiful, illuminating tale of hope and courage is based on interviews that were conducted with Holocaust survivor and Auschwitz-Birkenau tattooist Ludwig (Lale) Sokolov—an unforgettable love story in the midst of atrocity.In April 1942, Lale Sokolov, a Slovakian Jew, is forcibly transported to the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. When his captors discover that he speaks several languages, he is put to work as a Tätowierer (the German word for tattooist), tasked with permanently marking his fellow prisoners.Imprisoned for over two and a half years, Lale witnesses horrific atrocities and barbarism—but also incredible acts of bravery and compassion. Risking his own life, he uses his privileged position to exchange jewels and money from murdered Jews for food to keep his fellow prisoners alive.One day in July 1942, Lale, prisoner 32407, comforts a trembling young woman waiting in line to have the number 34902 tattooed onto her arm. Her name is Gita, and in that first encounter, Lale vows to somehow survive the camp and marry her.A vivid, harrowing, and ultimately hopeful re-creation of Lale Sokolov's experiences as the man who tattooed the arms of thousands of prisoners with what would become one of the most potent symbols of the Holocaust, The Tattooist of Auschwitz is also a testament to the endurance of love and humanity under the darkest possible conditions.",0062797158,9780062797155),Paperback,,272 pages,"
