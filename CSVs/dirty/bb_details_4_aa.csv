","She took a dare and fell in love. Truth would have been the smarter choice.After years of living under her father’s thumb, Emmeline is ready to break free. She’s abandoned her life as a New York socialite to follow her dream of becoming a kindergarten teacher in a small, wholesome town. Seeing the man that nearly broke her was absolutely not what she had hoped to find in Prescott, Montana.Nick hasn’t seen his Emmy in nine years, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten a thing about the woman he loves. After just one blissful night as man and wife, he gave her up, sacrificing his own happiness to keep her safe—far away from him. But the moment she walks back into his lonely life is the moment he decides never to let her go again. He won’t waste his second chance. All he has to do is win back Emmeline’s heart, keep her safe from the shadows in his past and prove to her that taking a wager on him is a sure bet.",,,ebook,,408 pages,"

","From bestselling author Charlie Huston comes a novel about the fears that find us all during dark times and the courage and sacrifice that can save us in the face of unimaginable odds. Gripping, unnerving, exhilarating, and haunting, Sleepless is well worth staying up for.What former philosophy student Parker Hass wanted was a better world. A world both just and safe for his wife and infant daughter. So he joined the LAPD and tried to make it that way. But the world changed. Struck by waves of chaos carried in on a tide of insomnia. A plague of sleeplessness.Park can sleep, but he is wide awake. And as much as he wishes he was dreaming, his eyes are open. He has no choice but to see it all. That's his job. Working undercover as a drug dealer in a Los Angeles ruled in equal parts by martial law and insurgency, he's tasked with cutting off illegal trade in Dreamer, the only drug that can give the infected what they most crave: sleep.After a year of lost leads and false trails, Park stumbles into the perilous shadows cast by the pharmaceuticals giant behind Dreamer. Somewhere in those shadows, at the nexus of disease and drugs and money, a secret is hiding. Drawn into the inner circle of a tech guru with a warped agenda and a special use for the sleepless themselves, Park thinks he knows what that secret might be. To know for certain, he will have to go deeper into the restless world. His wife has become sleepless, and their daughter may soon share the same fate. For them, he will risk what they need most from him: his belief that justice must be served. Unknown to him, his choice ties all of their futures to the singularly deadly nature of an aging mercenary who stalks Park.The deeper Park stumbles through the dark, the more he is convinced that it is obscuring the real world. Bring enough light and the shadows will retreat. Bring enough light and everyone will see themselves again. Bring enough light and he will find his way to the safe corner, the harbor he's promised his family. Whatever the cost to himself.It is July 2010.The future is coming.Open your eyes.",0345501136,9780345501134),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

Born on a Celtic isle to eight warrior-witch mothers, Maeve is raised to be as brave as any hero. In her stubborn, enchanting voice, she recounts her perilous quest for the young man, Esus, whose life she once saved from druid sacrifice.

Perché il più antico vampiro della stirpe di Blackmore abbandona per lei l’eternità suscitando le ire di Axel Vandemberg, glaciale Princeps dello Studium e tormentato amore della giovane? La Vecchia Capitale si prepara alla Vigilia di Ognissanti e il coprifuoco è vicino perché il Presidio sta per aprire le sue porte. Il lento salmodiare delle orde di penitenti che si riversano per le vie, in cerca di anime da punire, è il segnale per gli abitanti di affrettarsi nelle proprie case, ma per Eloise Weiss è già troppo tardi. Scambiata per una vampira, cade vittima dell’irrazionalità di una fede che brucia ogni cosa al suo passaggio. In fin di vita esala una richiesta d’aiuto che giunge alle soglie della tomba dove Ashton Blackmore, un redivivo secolare, riposa protetto dalle ombre della Cattedrale di Black Friars. Il richiamo della ragazza è un sussurro che si trasforma in ordine, irrompe nella sua mente e lo riporta alla vita.

Still an integral part of India's cultural and religious expression, the Ramayana was originally composed by the Sanskrit poet Valmiki around 300 b.c. The epic of Prince Rama's betrayal, exile, and struggle to rescue his faithful wife, Sita, from the clutches of a demon and to reclaim his throne has profoundly affected the literature, art, and culture of South and Southeast Asia-an influence most likely unparalleled in the history of world literature, except, possibly, for the Bible. Throughout the centuries, countless versions of the epic have been produced in numerous formats and languages. But previous English versions have been either too short to capture the magnitude of the original; too secular in presenting what is, in effect, scripture; or dry, line-by-line translations. Now novelist Ramesh Menon has rendered the tale in lyrical prose that conveys all the beauty and excitement of the original, while making this spiritual and literary classic accessible to a new generation of readers.",8172764065,9788172764067),,,,,"['Classics', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Religion', 'Cultural', 'India', 'Poetry', 'Fiction']"

","This is the definitive visual biography of Barack Obama's presidency, captured in intimate, unprecedented detail by his official White House photographer.Pete Souza began photographing President Obama on his first day as a U.S. senator, in January 2005, and served as the chief official White House photographer for the President's full two terms. Souza was with President Obama more often, and at more crucial moments, than any friend or staff member, or even the First Lady--and he photographed it all. Souza captured nearly 2 million photographs of Obama, in moments ranging from classified to disarmingly candid.This large-format (12""x10""), exquisitely produced book presents more than 300 of Souza's favorite and most iconic images from these historic years; many have never been seen before. This seminal work on the Obama presidency documents moments of national importance--including the historic image of the President and his advisors watching tensely in the Situation Room as the Bin Laden mission unfolded--alongside unguarded moments with the President's family, his many encounters with children, and his time spent interacting with world leaders, members of Congress, White House staff, artists, musicians and more.The photographs are paired with captions and stories providing behind-the-scenes context for each, and offer insight into the special relationship Souza and the President forged during their time together. The result is a stunning record of a landmark era in American history.Souza's work enabled us to feel that we knew the President. This book puts us in the White House with him.",0316512583,9780316512589),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","A ruthless young assassin continues her journey for revenge in this new epic fantasy from New York Times bestselling author Jay Kristoff.Assassin Mia Corvere has found her place among the Blades of Our Lady of Blessed Murder, but many in the Red Church ministry think she’s far from earned it. Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she’s no closer to ending Consul Scaeva and Cardinal Duomo, or avenging her familia. And after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia begins to suspect the motives of the Red Church itself.When it’s announced that Scaeva and Duomo will be making a rare public appearance at the conclusion of the grand games in Godsgrave, Mia defies the Church and sells herself to a gladiatorial collegium for a chance to finally end them. Upon the sands of the arena, Mia finds new allies, bitter rivals, and more questions about her strange affinity for the shadows. But as conspiracies unfold within the collegium walls, and the body count rises, Mia will be forced to choose between loyalty and revenge, and uncover a secret that could change the very face of her world.Set in the world of Nevernight, which Publishers Weekly called “absorbing in its complexity and bold in its bloodiness,” Godsgrave will continue to thrill and satisfy fantasy fans everywhere.",,,Kindle Edition,,448 pages,"

","Tóth Árpád: Karinthy Frigyes: GrimaszA magyar újság-croquis egyike a nálunk termett és fejlődött legsajátosabb irodalmi műfajoknak. Első mesterei és későbbi továbbfejlesztői különös munkát végeztek, körülbelül olyat, mint a Vigadó-palota zseniális építője, aki úgy akart magyar stílust teremteni, hogy kelet és nyugat egy-egy jellegzetes építő stílusát, a mórt és a románt keverte. Nem ily öntudatosan, de körülbelül ezzel a módszerrel dolgoztak a magyar szellemesség irodalmi kifejezői is: keletről hozott, kényelmes, vitézkötéses, anekdotás humorunkat franciáktól tanult fogásokkal tették modernebbé, csattanóbbá, finomabbá. Két nevet említek, a Mikszáthét és Heltaiét, a két legkitűnőbb mesterét: az egyik még talán túlságos táblabírós zamatú, a másik már talán túlságosan is francia. De mindkettőben főtulajdonság: a bölcs derű és a finomság, a szatíra náluk inkább csak pikáns árnyalat!A legújabb magyar újság-croquis-k erős fordulatot mutatnak: a bölcs mosolyból kegyetlen grimasz lett. Már Molnár Ferenc croquis-cikkei is ezt a fordulatot éreztetik, de legteljesebben Karinthy Frigyes szokatlan merészségű és erejű ilynemű művei rajzolják elénk az új magyar croquis képét. Molnárnál még némi bujkáló líra enyhíti olykor a maró viccet, Karinthynál teljes fölényével és kegyetlenségével lép elő a szatíra. Croquis-cikkei olvasásakor fantasztikus, már-már félelmes méretekig lendülő cirkuszi bohóc víziója elevenedik elém, egy krétás arcú vigyorgóé, aki pofonokat oszt, fejeket tép le, amiket fordítva, eltorzítva ragaszt vissza, s olykor a csillagokig nyúl, hogy azokkal mutasson be groteszk és döbbenetes tréfákat.Karinthy szokatlan sikerének kétségkívül az a titka, hogy bár kegyetlen s bár igen gyakran a croquis szerény korlátain szinte brutális erővel veti túl magát heves lendülete, mindvégig kacagtató tud maradni. A mulattató helyzetek variálásában, a nevettető torzítás biztosságában elsőrangú, s a croquis-nyelv kezelésében szinte páratlan. A furcsa, alakuló budapesti nyelv bravúros kezelője, s akárhányszor avatott továbbfejlesztője is. Némely fordulata, egy-egy alakjának neve szájról szájra száll, s olyanok szókincsébe is beiktatódik, akik talán nem is olvasták croquis-jait.Karinthy szatirikus cikkei - melyek közül legújabb kötetében, a Grimasz címűben, talán a legjellegzetesebbeket gyűjtötte össze - a maguk módján pompás kifejezői napjaink szellemének, az író kitűnő hivatottságát mi sem mutatja jobban, minthogy ez a kifejezőerő egy jelentéktelenebb műfaj keretében is oly dúsan adatott meg neki.",,,ebook,,,"

The peace campaigners who undertook this direct action took the unprecedented step of suing the British government under international law for crimes against humanity. What emerges is an extraordinary story with the most wide-ranging implications of any act of disarmament since the formation of the anti-nuclear movement. This book is written by the man closest to the Trident Three—their lawyer. Using the highest laws in the world—the Nuremberg Principles and the reasoning handed down by the World Court—John Mayer’s argument persuaded independent judiciary that nuclear weapons lie outside the bounds of international law.,1904132049,9781904132042),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

","Born into “the blessings of liberty in a free State,” Solomon Northup was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Bayou Boeuf region of Louisiana’s Red River Valley. Twelve Years a Slave is the chronicle of his captivity at the mercy of sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps, who tested Northup’s tenacity and self-control under the most brutal conditions. Until fate brought a Canadian abolitionist to Epps’s farm, Northup thought he would never draw another free breath.To this day Northup’s harrowing memoir is recognized as the most reliable, accurate eyewitness account of the daily lives of slaves. As a significant historical reference, it is unsurpassed. As an authentic narrative of a man starved of his freedom, it is unforgettable.AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors.

In the months that followed, ten thousand men--trained and hardened in three decades of war in Greece--would engage in pitched battles, witness untold horrors, and begin a desperate march across he desert, over raging rivers, and into the jaws of hell itself. By the time it was over, some would be alive, others dead, and one among them would emerge and the greatest hero of all...In a novel of high adventure and riveting historical drama, Michael Curtis Ford brings to life an amazing true story from Greek antiquity--Xenophon's march of the ten Thousand. A tale of war and peace, of loyalties and betrayals, and of a soldier's love for a mysterious and dangerous woman, The Ten Thousand captures the eternal spirit of courage--in the face of impossible odds.",0312980329,9780312980320),Mass Market Paperback,,466 pages,"

Nemesis (n.)1) An opponent or rival whom a person cannot best or overcome;2) A person’s undoing;3) Joshua Templeman.
Lucy Hutton and Joshua Templeman hate each other. Not dislike. Not begrudgingly tolerate. Hate. And they have no problem displaying their feelings through a series of ritualistic passive aggressive maneuvers as they sit across from each other, executive assistants to co-CEOs of a publishing company. Lucy can’t understand Joshua’s joyless, uptight, meticulous approach to his job. Joshua is clearly baffled by Lucy’s overly bright clothes, quirkiness, and Pollyanna attitude.Now up for the same promotion, their battle of wills has come to a head and Lucy refuses to back down when their latest game could cost her her dream job…But the tension between Lucy and Joshua has also reached its boiling point, and Lucy is discovering that maybe she doesn’t hate Joshua. And maybe, he doesn’t hate her either. Or maybe this is just another game.",,,Kindle Edition,,387 pages,"

","Among all the texts and notes of Rabbi Baruch Shalom Halevi Ashlag (the Rabash), there was one special notebook he always carried. This notebook contained the transcripts of his conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehuda Leib Halevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam), author of the Sulam (Ladder) commentary on The Book of Zohar and of many other works on Kabbalah. Not feeling well on the Jewish New Year in September 1991, the Rabash summoned his prime disciple and personal assistant, Michael Laitman, to his bedside and handed him that notebook. Its cover contained only one word, Shamati (I Heard). As he handed the notebook, he said to Laitman, ""Take it and learn from it."" The following morning, he perished in his student?s arms, leaving him and many of his other disciples without guidance in this world. Committed to Rabash's legacy to disseminate the wisdom of Kabbalah, Laitman published the notebook just as it was written, thus retaining the text's transforming powers. Among all the books of Kabbalah, Shamati is a unique and compelling composition whose power persists long after the reading is through.",,,Kindle Edition,,410 pages,"

","Sétimo livro da série Outlander, Ecos do Futuro vai além da jornada de Claire e Jamie, apresentando outras três tramas paralelas. Enquanto o casal de protagonistas se vê às voltas com a Revolução Americana e a perspectiva de voltar para o Velho Mundo, Brianna e Roger, acompanhados dos filhos, tentam se readaptar à vida no século XX, para a qual acabam de retornar. Simultaneamente, Diana Gabaldon acompanha a trajetória de William Ransom, o filho adotado de Lord John Grey, ao ingressar no exército britânico para lutar contra os americanos. Para completar, o sobrinho de Jamie, Ian Murray, ganha uma história própria, tão intrincada quanto as demais.Não bastasse o inverno tenebroso pelo qual estão passando e todos os sombrios acontecimentos recentes, logo no início da trama a autora expõe Jamie e Ian a uma situação nada confortável, relacionada ao ouro roubado no último livro. A dupla acaba se envolvendo em um crime e Ian é jurado de morte. Em meio a tudo isso, ele terá de acompanhar a saída do tio e de Claire da Carolina do Norte em direção aos Highlands, onde Jamie pretende retomar a gráfica que deixou para trás, mas até isso se tornar realidade ainda há muito a ser enfrentado.Paralelamente, William Ransom passa por situações tragicômicas no exército britânico, assim como é desafiado constantemente. Durante sua trajetória enfrentando os americanos, William acaba cruzando com Ian Murray. Nesta altura da história um dos maiores receios de Jamie é deparar-se com William, seu filho criado pelo amigo John Grey, protagonista de outra série assinada por Diana Gabaldon. Diferente de outros livros, em Ecos do Futuro os integrantes da nova geração ganham um espaço considerável na história.Enquanto tudo isso transcorre no século XVIII, Roger e Brianna descobrem uma caixa de cartas de Claire e Jamie, as quais vão lendo aos poucos, como se a história relatada pelos pais estivesse apenas terminado de acontecer. Esta parece ser uma forma encontrada pela autora para manter a conexão entre as duas famílias, mesmo que agora elas estejam separadas por mais de 200 anos no tempo. Também é um ótimo recurso para relatar eventos vividos por Claire e Jamie sem se alongar muito.Assim como em capítulos anteriores da série, Diana Gabaldon inclui personalidades reais na trama, como Benjamin Franklin ou Benedict Arnold, além de fatos históricos nos quais seus personagens se envolvem. Além dos famosos, a autora oferece aos leitores uma série de personagens com papéis menores, mas que ajudam a dar a sustentação à trama, dividida em duas partes. Mantendo o estilo que conquistou milhões de leitores em todo o mundo, Diana Gabaldon mistura romance, suspense e disputas de poder numa narrativa que mantém a tensão e a emoção do início ao fim.",,,Paperback,,448 pages,"

","From Taylor Jenkins Reid, “a genius when it comes to stories about life and love” (Redbook), comes an unforgettable and sweeping novel about one classic film actress’s relentless rise to the top—the risks she took, the loves she lost, and the long-held secrets the public could never imagine.Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Written with Reid’s signature talent for “creating complex, likable characters” (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means—and what it takes—to face the truth.",,,Paperback,Canadian,391 pages,"

","A PRESCIENT POLITICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER RIPPED FROM TOMORROW'S HEADLINES, BY ONE OF GERMANY'S MOST CELEBRATED CONTEMPORARY NOVELISTSA few short years from now, the world is an even more uncertain place than it is today, and politics everywhere is marching rightward: Trump is gone, but Brexit is complete, as is Frexit. There's a global financial crisis, armed conflict, and mass migration, and an ultrapopulist movement governs in Germany. With their democracy facing the wrecking ball, most well-off Germans, turn inward, focusing on their own lives. Britta, a wife, mother, and successful businesswoman, ignores the daily news and concentrates on her family and her work running a clinic specializing in suicide prevention.But her legitimate business is connected to a secret and far more lucrative operation known as The Bridge, an outfit that supplies terrorist organizations looking to employ suicide bombers. Using a complex candidate-identifying algorithm designed by Babak, a brilliant programmer and Britta's only employee, The Bridge has effectively cornered the market, and terrorism almost never takes place without Britta's services - which is why news of a thwarted suicide attack in Leipzig comes as a shock. Then The Bridge's database is stolen, driving Britta, Babak, and their latest recruit into hiding. On their heels is a new terrorist organization called Empty Hearts, a group unlike any Britta and Babak have encountered before.Part suspenseful thriller, part wickedly effective social satire, 'Empty Hearts' is a novel for our times, examining urgent questions of morality, politics, and culture and presenting a startling vision of a future where empathy is a thing of the past.©2019 Juli Zeh and John Cullen (P)2019 Random House Audio",3630875238,9783630875231),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","In the 1880s, as the European powers were carving up Africa, King Leopold II of Belgium seized for himself the vast and mostly unexplored territory surrounding the Congo River. Carrying out a genocidal plundering of the Congo, he looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and ultimately slashed its population by ten million--all the while shrewdly cultivating his reputation as a great humanitarian. Heroic efforts to expose these crimes eventually led to the first great human rights movement of the twentieth century, in which everyone from Mark Twain to the Archbishop of Canterbury participated. King Leopold's Ghost is the haunting account of a megalomaniac of monstrous proportions, a man as cunning, charming, and cruel as any of the great Shakespearean villains. It is also the deeply moving portrait of those who fought Leopold: a brave handful of missionaries, travelers, and young idealists who went to Africa for work or adventure and unexpectedly found themselves witnesses to a holocaust. Adam Hochschild brings this largely untold story alive with the wit and skill of a Barbara Tuchman. Like her, he knows that history often provides a far richer cast of characters than any novelist could invent. Chief among them is Edmund Morel, a young British shipping agent who went on to lead the international crusade against Leopold. Another hero of this tale, the Irish patriot Roger Casement, ended his life on a London gallows. Two courageous black Americans, George Washington Williams and William Sheppard, risked much to bring evidence of the Congo atrocities to the outside world. Sailing into the middle of the story was a young Congo River steamboat officer named Joseph Conrad. And looming above them all, the duplicitous billionaire King Leopold II. With great power and compassion, King Leopold's Ghost will brand the tragedy of the Congo--too long forgotten--onto the conscience of the West",,,Kindle Edition,,402 pages,"

","American Power and the New Mandarins is Noam Chomsky’s first political book, widely considered to be among the most cogent and powerful statements against the American war in Vietnam. Long out of print, this collection of early, seminal essays helped to establish Chomsky as a leading critic of United States foreign policy. These pages mount a scathing critique of the contradictions of the war, and an indictment of the mainstream, liberal intellectuals—the “new mandarins”—who furnished what Chomsky argued was the necessary ideological cover for the horrors visited on the Vietnamese people.As America’s foreign entanglements deepen by the month, Chomsky’s lucid analysis is a sobering reminder of the perils of imperial diplomacy. With a new foreword by Howard Zinn, author of A People’s History of the United States, American Power and the New Mandarins is a renewed call for independent analysis of America’s role in the world.",156584775X,9781565847750),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Titelheldin der abenteuerlichen Erzählung Das Schneekind ist Montaine Vanier, die 18 Monate alte Tochter des Autors. Im zarten Kleinkindalter begleitete sie ihr Eltern ins ewige Eis des Nordens. Ihr Vater, Nicolas Vanier, war schon immer fasziniert von weiten Schneelandschaften: Er bereiste Lappland, Sibirien, Alaska und Kanada und wurde mit seiner ersten Schlittenhundfahrt quer über den amerikanischen Kontinent -- der weißen Odyssee -- weltbekannt. So erfüllte sich für ihn ein Traum, als der lang gehegte Plan, sich für ein ganzes Jahr in die endlos weite Einsamkeit zurückzuziehen, tatsächlich Gestalt annimmt. Dass das Familienabenteuer dann keineswegs so glatt abläuft, wie sich die beiden das vorgestellt hatten, tröstet all jene, die an derart abenteuerliche Unternehmungen gar nicht zu denken wagen. Klirrende Dauerkälte und die Mückenschwärme des kurzen Polarsommers, den die Vaniers nutzen, um ein Blockhaus zu bauen, die mühsame Jagd nach Schneeziegen, die Gefahren der Schneeschmelze, hungrige Grislibären und Temperaturen um -40 Grad Celsius, pfeifende Winterstürme und tückisches Packeis machen das Leben im hohen Norden hart: Bis an die Grenzen der eigenen Kraft muss das Paar gehen, um der Natur Nahrung, Wärme und ein Auskommen abzutrotzen. Dennoch überwiegen die Momente des Glücks bei der Suche nach dem Einswerden mit der Natur, kommt eine Klarheit und Poesie zum Vorschein, die in der Zivilisation kaum so intensiv zu empfinden ist. So wundert es nicht, dass auch für die kleine Montaine der Ausflug in die Kälte eine prägende Erfahrung wird, an der der Leser dank der ebenso liebevollen wie aufmerksamen Beobachtung der Eltern Anteil nimmt. Eine Reihe stimmungsvoller Fotos vermittelt Impressionen vom Familienleben in der Wildnis. Übrigens: Nicolas Vanier, der wie sein Vorbild Jack London eine Mischung aus Abenteurer und Schriftsteller sein möchte, lebt heute als Züchter von Schlittenhunden und Publizist in Frankreich und Kanada und bietet abenteuerliche Touren in den Norden des Québec an. --Dorothea Fröhlich",3492237207,9783492237208),Paperback,,351 pages,"

","The very title of the present volume calls for some initial explanation, if what it means is to be clearly understood and all misrepresentation prevented. Many no longer doubt the possibility of a world crisis, taking the latter word in its most usual acceptation, and this in itself marks a very noticeable change of outlook: by sheer force of circumstance certain illusions are beginning to vanish, and we cannot but rejoice that this is so, for it is at any rate a favorable symptom and a sign that a readjustment of the contemporary mentality is still possible— a glimmer of light as it were— in the midst of the present chaos. For example, the belief in a never-ending ‘progress’, which until recently was held as a sort of inviolable and indisputable dogma, is no longer so widespread; there are those who perceive, though in a vague and confused manner, that the civilization of the West may not always go on developing in the same direction, but may some day reach a point where it will stop, or even be plunged in its entirety into some cataclysm. Such persons may not see clearly where the danger lies— the fantastic or puerile fears they sometimes express being proof enough that their minds still harbor many errors— but it is already something that they realize there is a danger, even if it is felt rather than understood; and it is also something that they can conceive that this civilization, with which the moderns are so infatuated, holds no privileged position in the history of the world, and may easily encounter the same fate as has befallen many others that have already disappeared at more or less remote periods, some of them having left traces so slight as to be hardly noticeable, let alone recognizable.",0900588241,9780900588242),Paperback,,120 pages,"

","My Sister, the Serial Killer is a blackly comic novel about how blood is thicker - and more difficult to get out of the carpet - than water...When Korede's dinner is interrupted one night by a distress call from her sister, Ayoola, she knows what's expected of her: bleach, rubber gloves, nerves of steel and a strong stomach. This'll be the third boyfriend Ayoola's dispatched in, quote, self-defence and the third mess that her lethal little sibling has left Korede to clear away. She should probably go to the police for the good of the menfolk of Nigeria, but she loves her sister and, as they say, family always comes first. Until, that is, Ayoola starts dating the doctor where Korede works as a nurse. Korede's long been in love with him, and isn't prepared to see him wind up with a knife in his back: but to save one would mean sacrificing the other...",0385544235,9780385544238),Hardcover,,226 pages,"

St. Peter's Square, Rome. White smoke signals that a new Pope has been chosen. Is it possible that the new Pope...is a woman?
The world is watching as historic crowds gather in Rome, waiting for news of a new Pope, one who promises to be unlike any other in the Church's history. Some followers are ecstatic, but the leading candidate has made a legion of powerful enemies. From a difficult childhood with drug addled parents, to a career as a doctor on the front lines in Sudan, to a series of trials that test her faith at every turn, Brigid Fitzgerald's convictions and callings have made her the target of all those who fear that the Church has lost its way--dangerous adversaries who abhor challenges to tradition. Locked in a deadly, high-stakes battle with forces determined to undermine everything she believes in, Brigid must convert her enemies to her cause before she loses her faith...and her life.",031627402X,9780316274029),Hardcover,,362 pages,"

","Dr. Amin Jaafari, an Arab-Israeli citizen, is a surgeon at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Dedicated to his work, respected and admired by his colleagues and community, he represents integration at its most successful. He has learned to live with the violence and chaos that plague his city, and on the night of a deadly bombing in a local restaurant, he works tirelessly to help the shocked and shattered patients brought to the emergency room. But this night of turmoil and death takes a horrifyingly personal turn. His wife's body is found among the dead, with massive injuries, the police coldly announce, typical of those found on the bodies of fundamentalist suicide bombers. As evidence mounts that his wife, Sihem, was responsible for the catastrophic bombing, Dr. Jaafari is torn between cherished memories of their years together and the inescapable realization that the beautiful, intelligent, thoroughly modern woman he loved had a life far removed from the comfortable, assimilated existence they shared. From the graphic, beautifully rendered description of the bombing that opens the novel to the searing conclusion, The Attack portrays the reality of terrorism and its incalculable spiritual costs. Intense and humane, devoid of political bias, hatred, and polemics, it probes deep inside the Muslim world and gives readers a profound understanding of what seems impossible to understand.",2266162691,9782266162692),Mass Market Paperback,,246 pages,"

","Charles Dicken's Great Expectations is at once a superbly constructed novel of spellbinding mystery and a profound examination of moral values. An orphan living with his older sister and her kindly husband, Pip is hired by wealthy and embittered Miss Havisham as a companion for her and her beautiful adopted daughter, Estella. His years in service to the Havishams fill his heart with the desire to rise above his station in life. Pip's wish is fulfilled when a mysterious benefactor provides him with ""great expectations"" -the means to be tutored as a gentleman.Thrust into London's high-society circles, Pip grows accustomed to a life of leisure, only to find himself lacking as a suitor competing for Estella's favor. After callously discarding everything he once valued for his own selfish pursuits, Pip learns the identity of his patron -a revelation that shatters his very soul.From the agony of Dicken's disenchantment with the Victorian middle class comes a work that gives an added dimension to his matchless genius.",,,Paperback,,508 pages,"

All she has is what she’s always had: herself.After failing to secure the Wallachian throne, Lada Dracul is out to punish anyone who dares to cross her blood-strewn path. Filled with a white-hot rage, she storms the countryside with her men, accompanied by her childhood friend Bogdan, terrorizing the land. But brute force isn’t getting Lada what she wants. And thinking of Mehmed brings little comfort to her thorny heart. There’s no time to wonder whether he still thinks about her, even loves her. She left him before he could leave her. What Lada needs is her younger brother Radu’s subtlety and skill. But Mehmed has sent him to Constantinople—and it’s no diplomatic mission. Mehmed wants control of the city, and Radu has earned an unwanted place as a double-crossing spy behind enemy lines. Radu longs for his sister’s fierce confidence—but for the first time in his life, he rejects her unexpected plea for help. Torn between loyalties to faith, to the Ottomans, and to Mehmed, he knows he owes Lada nothing. If she dies, he could never forgive himself—but if he fails in Constantinople, will Mehmed ever forgive him? As nations fall around them, the Dracul siblings must decide: what will they sacrifice to fulfill their destinies? Empires will topple, thrones will be won…and souls will be lost.",0553522353,9780553522358),Hardcover,,471 pages,"

","Warning: BEYOND THE ICE LIMIT is the sequel to THE ICE LIMIT. While BEYOND is a stand-alone novel, we want to warn potential readers that the copy below contains serious spoilers for THE ICE LIMIT, for those who wish to read that book first.That thing is growing again. We must destroy it. The time to act is now...With these words begins Gideon Crew's latest, most dangerous, most high-stakes assignment yet. Failure will mean nothing short of the end of humankind on earth.Five years ago, the mysterious and inscrutable head of Effective Engineering Solutions, Eli Glinn, led a mission to recover a gigantic meteorite--the largest ever discovered--from a remote island off the coast of South America. The mission ended in disaster when their ship, the Rolvaag, foundered in a vicious storm in the Antarctic waters and broke apart, sinking-along with its unique cargo-to the ocean floor. One hundred and eight crew members perished, and Eli Glinn was left paralyzed.But this was not all. The tragedy revealed something truly terrifying: the meteorite they tried to retrieve was not, in fact, simply a rock. Instead, it was a complex organism from the deep reaches of space.Now, that organism has implanted itself in the sea bed two miles below the surface-and it is growing. If it is not destroyed, the planet will be doomed. There is only one hope: for Glinn and his team to annihilate it, a task which requires Gideon's expertise with nuclear weapons. But as Gideon and his colleagues soon discover, the ""meteorite"" has a mind of its own-and it has no intention of going quietly...

Her husband of eight years, the one who should have been on a business trip to Kansas, had suffered a fatal car accident in Hawaii. And he wasn’t alone.For Jacks, laying her husband to rest was hard. But it was even harder to think that his final moments belonged to another woman—one who had left behind her own grieving and bewildered fiancé. Nick, just as blindsided by the affair, wants answers. So he suggests that he and Jacks search for the truth together, retracing the doomed lovers’ last days in paradise.Now, following the twisting path of that fateful road, Jacks is learning that nothing is ever as it seems.

","Described by the Dalai Lama as ""one of the greatest thinkers of the age"", Jiddu Krishnamurti has influenced millions throughout the twentieth century -- including such notables as Joseph Campbell, Dr. Jonas Salk, Aldous Huxley, Van Morrison, Bertrand Russell, Henry Miller, and Bruce Lee -- and his work continues to inspire even a decade after his death. Born of middle-class Brahmin parents in 1895, Krishnamurti was recognized at age fourteen by Theosophists Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater as the anticipated world teacher and proclaimed to be the vehicle for the reincarnation of Christ in the West and of Buddha in the East. In 1929 he repudiated these claims and traveled the world, sharing his philosophical insights and establishing schools and foundations.Because Krishnamurti had no interest in presenting theories, his thought is far removed from academic philosophy in the analytic tradition, yet his insights remain extremely relevant to contemporary philosophical theories and to people who are passionately interested in understanding themselves and the world. Rather than a theorist, Krishnamurti was a seer and a teacher. He saw inherently distorting psychological structures that bring about a division in every person's consciousness between ""the observer"" and ""the observed"". This division, he believed, is a potent source of conflict -- both internally for the individual and through the individual externalized for society as a whole. Krishnamurti envisioned a radical transformation in human consciousness and offered a way to transcend these harmful structures.Krishnamurti: Reflections on the Self is a collection of Krishnamurti's writings and lectures about the individual inrelation to society. In Reflections, he examines the importance of inquiry, the role of emotions, the relation between experience and the self, the observer/observed distinction, the nature of freedom, and other philosophical ideas.""In my own life Krishnamurti influenced me profoundly and helped me personally break through the confines of my own restrictions to my freedom"". -- Deepak Chopra, M.D.",0812693558,9780812693553),Paperback,,234 pages,"

","Individuals sometimes derive sexual pleasure from submission to cruel discipline. While that predilection was noted as early as the sixteenth century, masochism was not codified as a concept until 1890. According to John K. Noyes, its invention reflected a crisis in the liberal understanding of subjectivity and sexuality which continues to inform discussions of masochism today. In essence, it remains a political concept.Viennese physician Richard yon Krafft-Ebing coined the term masochism, based on the work of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Noyes analyzes the social and political problems that inspired the concept, suggesting, for example, that the triumphant expansion of European colonialism was in part animated by an ambivalence in masculine sexuality.Noyes documents the evolution of the concept of masochism with scenes in literature from John Cleland's Fanny Hill through Sacher-Masoch's Venus in Furs and Pauline Reage's Story of O. Analysis of Freud's vastly influential rereading of masochism precedes an exploration of the work of his successors, including Wilhem Reich, Theodor Reik, Helene Deutsch, and Karen Horney. Noyes suggests that the thematics of feminine masochism emerged only gradually from an exclusively male concept.",0801433452,9780801433450),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are three distinct and separate persons sharing in one divinity, with the Father of Jesus as being the “Almighty God,” Jesus as being the “Divine Son of God,” and the Holy Spirit as being the “Divine Spirit of God.”  Another thing, Jesus is inherently divine—not human. He is divine made man, not man made divine.   And even during the time that he was living in the world as man, his divinity was yet all perfectly intact with him as God’s Son.Amen.",,,ebook,,76 pages,"

","Nel 1914 Vera Brittain si affaccia alla giovinezza. È brillante e anticonformista, decisa a cambiare un destino di moglie gentile e madre paziente diventando una delle prime donne ammesse in un selettivo college di Oxford. Con l'egocentrismo dei suoi vent'anni, inizialmente Vera considera la grande guerra soprattutto una scomoda interruzione delle proprie attività. Ma la portata degli eventi che stanno travolgendo l'Europa diventa presto chiara: la devastazione non è solo materiale, ma anche psicologica e spirituale. Lasciata Oxford, Vera diventa infermiera volontaria e serve la patria a Londra, a Malta, in Francia, mentre il fratello, il fidanzato, gli amici più cari perdono la vita nelle trincee. Sopravvivere a tutto e tornare a un nuovo genere di ""normalità"" non sarà facile. Dopo una risurrezione difficile ma necessaria, divenuta scrittrice e giornalista, Vera raccoglie le sue memorie in quest'opera incisiva e struggente, testamento ideale e tributo alla sua generazione. Il libro è un classico della letteratura inglese, perché attraverso la propria storia, vivida e sincera, Vera non racconta soltanto la disillusione e il dolore, ma anche il cammino di maturazione delle idee per le quali ha combattuto tutta la vita, armata solo della sua penna: pacifismo e lotta per i diritti delle donne.",8809804538,9788809804531),Hardcover,Narrativa non fiction,640 pages,"

Malala Yousafzai refused to be silenced and fought for her right to an education.On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price.

A tutte le domande che queste figure leggendarie suscitano, Arthur Golden ha risposto con un romanzo, profondamente documentato, che conserva tutta l’immediatezza e l’emozione di una storia vera. Che cosa significa essere una geisha lo apprendiamo così dalla voce di Sayuri che ci racconta la sua storia: l’infanzia, il rapimento, l’addestramento, la disciplina – tutte le vicende che, sullo sfondo del Giappone del ‘900, l’hanno condotta a diventare la geisha più famosa e ricercata.

Vincent de Saint-Bonnet è enormemente ricco, nasconde molti segreti e ha poca voglia di vivere. Ci vorranno due splendidi occhi azzurri e un ladruncolo particolarmente sboccato, per illuminare nuovamente la sua grigia e lunghissima esistenza.

Entrambi hanno uno scopo ben preciso e non si fermeranno di fronte a nulla nel cercare di perseguirlo. Neanche di fronte all’incredibile attrazione che li attanaglia e che li trascinerà in un duello, combattuto a colpi di bugie e seduzione.  ",,,Kindle Edition,,260 pages,"

","Oct. 11th, 1943 - A British spy plane crashes in Nazi-occupied France. Its pilot and passenger are best friends. One of the girls has a chance at survival. The other has lost the game before it's barely begun. When ""Verity"" is arrested by the Gestapo, she's sure she doesn't stand a chance. As a secret agent captured in enemy territory, she's living a spy's worst nightmare. Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane. On each new scrap of paper, Verity battles for her life, confronting her views on courage and failure and her desperate hope to make it home. But will trading her secrets be enough to save her from the enemy? Harrowing and beautifully written, Elizabeth Wein creates a visceral read of danger, resolve, and survival that shows just how far true friends will go to save each other. Code Name Verity is an outstanding novel that will stick with you long after the last page.",,,Kindle Edition,,353 pages,"

","Northern Lights introduces Lyra, an orphan, who lives in a parallel universe in which science, theology and magic are entwined. Lyra's search for a kidnapped friend uncovers a sinister plot involving stolen children and turns into a quest to understand a mysterious phenomenon called Dust. In The Subtle Knife she is joined on her journey by Will, a boy who possesses a knife that can cut windows between worlds. As Lyra learns the truth about her parents and her prophesied destiny, the two young people are caught up in a war against celestial powers that ranges across many worlds and leads to a thrilling conclusion in The Amber Spyglass.The epic story Pullman tells is not only a spellbinding adventure featuring armoured polar bears, magical devices, witches and daemons, it is also an audacious and profound re-imagining of Milton's Paradise Lost.

","A prominent Viennese psychiatrist before the war, Viktor Frankl was uniquely able to observe the way that both he and others in Auschwitz coped (or didn't) with the experience. He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances. The sort of person the concentration camp prisoner became was the result of an inner decision and not of camp influences alone. Frankl came to believe man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.",,,Kindle Edition,,160 pages,"

",Galardonada con el prestigioso premio Goncourt des Lyceens 2007 e instalada en las listas de libros mas vendidos desde su publicacion esta ultima novela de Philippe Claudel continua la senda iniciada en Almas grises: la investigacion de los claroscuros del alma humana. Apenas ha transcurrido un ano desde el final de la guerra cuando una muerte rompe la tranquilidad de un pequeno pueblo perdido en las montanas. El unico extranjero del lugar a quien llaman Der Anderer el Otro en aleman ha sido asesinado y todos los hombres de la localidad se confiesan autores del crimen. Todos menos Brodeck quien recibe el encargo de redactar un informe sobre lo sucedido para que quienes lo lean puedan comprender y perdonar . Asi pues Brodeck entrevista a los hombres mas importantes del pueblo: el cura el dueno de la fonda el alcalde... Y cuando este ultimo le advierte de que no busque lo que no existe. O lo que existio pero ya no existe Brodeck comprende que no le conviene saber demasiado. Sin embargo la redaccion del informe lo obliga a interrogar y a interrogarse lo que a la postre puede suponer una amenaza para el y su familia. Considerado actualmente uno de los mejores novelistas franceses de su generacion Philippe Claudel renueva su exploracion de los recodos mas sombrios del ser humano y sus complejos mecanismos. Los escasos detalles sobre el lugar y el tiempo de la accion el pausado relato del narrador y su peculiar voz al limite de la ingenuidad otorgan a la novela la dimension de una parabola de enorme eficacia e intensidad a la vez sombria y llena de esperanza.,849838186X,9788498381863),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","If you want to learn about one of history’s most fascinating minds and uncover some of his secrets of imagination—secrets that enabled him to invent machines light years ahead of his time and literally bring light to the world—then you want to read this book.Imagination amplifies and colors every other element of genius, and unlocks our potential for understanding and ability. It’s no coincidence that geniuses not only dare to dream of the impossible for their work, but do the same for their lives. They’re audacious enough to think that they’re not just ordinary players. Few stories better illustrate this better than the life of the father of the modern world, a man of legendary imaginative power and wonder: Nikola Tesla.In this book, you’ll be taken on a whirlwind journey through Tesla’s life and work, and not only learn about the successes and mistakes of one of history’s greatest inventors, but also how to look at the world in a different, more imaginative way.Read this book now and learn lessons from Nikola Tesla on why imagination is so vital to awakening your inner genius, and insights into the real “secret” to creativity, as explained by people like Jobs, Picasso, Dali, and Twain.",,,Kindle Edition,,46 pages,"

","What made him lie to you?What caused him to notice her?What made him emotionally attached to her?The men in this novel are fictitious, but their behaviors and mannerisms are as tangible as the skin on your lips. Infallible is Infidelity from the perspective of men who perfected the art of grooming an additional lover, and their self-justification for her existence. Their names are embellished, but you know them, you've dated one of them: you didn't realize it until it was too late. These five adulterers will expound on the age-old question better than any magazine article or chat with a girlfriend over a pint of gelato. What makes a man cheat? Welcome to Infallible: VOL 2; where our cast of characters are faced with a life-changing decision to end their secondary relationships or continue as Man Whores. VOL 1 ended with a financial incentive from Uncle Glenn; VOL 2 picks up with the stipulation that they must dissolve the relationship with their mistresses within 72 hours. Can they do it? Will they do it? If you desire the truth about adultery in a glittered box tied with a pink ribbon, then INFALLIBLE is not for you. This novel is unapologetically raw and abrasive, because the discovery of an affair is equally raw and abrasive. Author TJ Spencer Jacques has gift-wrapped the ugly truth from a perspective that was never intended for female consumption. INFALLIBLE: VOL 2 is the whole truth conveniently packaged to provide insight and educate would-be victims. Welcome to Infallible - enter at the risk of your innocence.",0990373266,9780990373261),Kindle Edition,,235 pages,"

Er überredet sie zu einem Deal: Einen Sommer lang soll sie ihn begleiten, danach springen sie zusammen – wenn sie es immer noch möchte.  Was folgt, ist eine Reise, in der Kansas das Leben wiederfindet. Doch das neue Glück ist zerbrechlicher als Glas, denn River ist nicht der, der er vorgibt zu sein. Und während ihre Verletzungen heilen, geht es River immer schlechter. Schon bald fragt sie sich, wer von ihnen wirklich gerettet werden muss – und welches dunkle Geheimnis er vor ihr versteckt.  River und Kansas, eine Liebe wie der Tanz auf einem Drahtseil ohne Sicherung. Nur einen Schritt vom Tod entfernt. Intensiv. Gefährlich. Romantisch.",,,Kindle Edition,,438 pages,"

","The daring, dazzling and highly anticipated follow-up to the New York Times bestseller The Song of AchillesOne of the Most Anticipated Books of 2018""An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner."" - Ann PatchettIn the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.",1549117645,9781549117640),Audiobook,Unabridged,12 pages,"

","WHEN A MAN WAS REDUCED to asking advice of a tomcat, it didn’t bode well for the state of his affairs. And yet, here Brian Riordan was doing exactly that.   So begins this prequel to the Exit Unicorns series, as we join the Riordan boys in the rough and tumble world of Belfast, Northern Ireland, during a summer of change and promise. Casey Riordan is on the cusp on manhood, and is learning just how high the price of that transition can be. Tagging along on this adventure is his brother, Pat, who is both shadow and conscience to Casey. Their father, Brian, is simply trying to keep his sons safe—a tall order in the gritty streets of this particular city.   Bare Knuckle spans the events of one summer, giving a glimpse into the lives of the Riordans—the boys as they embark on the path to the men they are destined to be, and their father as he guides them along the way. The road is not smooth and contains hard lessons, both those of betrayal and treachery, all stemming from the events of one warm July night, when the match of hatred is set to the fuel of violence. After that night, life as they know it spirals out of control for the Riordans, until one man is forced to rejoin a world he thought he’d left behind forever, to ensure the safety of those he loves.

","A young mortician goes behind the scenes, unafraid of the gruesome (and fascinating) details of her curious profession.Most people want to avoid thinking about death, but Caitlin Doughty—a twenty-something with a degree in medieval history and a flair for the macabre—took a job at a crematory, turning morbid curiosity into her life’s work. Thrown into a profession of gallows humor and vivid characters (both living and very dead), Doughty learned to navigate the secretive culture of those who care for the deceased.Smoke Gets in Your Eyes tells an unusual coming-of-age story full of bizarre encounters and unforgettable scenes. Caring for dead bodies of every color, shape, and affliction, Doughty soon becomes an intrepid explorer in the world of the dead. She describes how she swept ashes from the machines (and sometimes onto her clothes) and reveals the strange history of cremation and undertaking, marveling at bizarre and wonderful funeral practices from different cultures.Her eye-opening, candid, and often hilarious story is like going on a journey with your bravest friend to the cemetery at midnight. She demystifies death, leading us behind the black curtain of her unique profession. And she answers questions you didn’t know you had: Can you catch a disease from a corpse? How many dead bodies can you fit in a Dodge van? What exactly does a flaming skull look like?Honest and heartfelt, self-deprecating and ironic, Doughty's engaging style makes this otherwise taboo topic both approachable and engrossing. Now a licensed mortician with an alternative funeral practice, Doughty argues that our fear of dying warps our culture and society, and she calls for better ways of dealing with death (and our dead).",,,Audiobook,,,"

At its heart is one day in a Japanese slave labour camp in August 1943. As the day builds to its horrific climax, Dorrigo Evans battles and fails in his quest to save the lives of his fellow POWs, a man is killed for no reason, and a love story unfolds.",0385352859,9780385352857),Hardcover,,334 pages,"

","Комментарий экспертаНастоящий текст, известный также под названием «А Хули», является неумелой литературной подделкой, изготовленной неизвестным автором в первой четверти XXI века. Большинство экспертов согласны, что интересна не сама эта рукопись, а тот метод, которым она была заброшена в мир. Текстовый файл, озаглавленный «А Хули», якобы находился на хард-диске портативного компьютера, обнаруженного при «драматических обстоятельствах» в одном из московских парков. О срежиссированности этой акции свидетельствует милицейский протокол, в котором описана находка. Он, как нам представляется, дает неплохое представление о виртуозных технологиях современного пиара.Протокол подлинный, все печати и подписи на нем присутствуют, хотя неизвестно точное время его составления — верхняя часть заглавного листа с датой срезана при брошюровке и подшивке протокола в папку перед отправкой на хранение в конце календарного года, как требует служебная должностная инструкция. Из протокола следует, что интерес сотрудников милиции был вызван странными явлениями природы в Битцевском парке Южного административного округа города Москвы. Граждане наблюдали над деревьями голубоватое свечение, шаровые молнии и множество пятицветных радуг. Некоторые из радуг были шарообразными (по показаниям свидетелей происшествия, цвета в них как бы просвечивали друг сквозь друга).Эпицентром аномалии был обширный пустырь на границе парка, где расположен трамплин для прыжков на велосипеде. Рядом с трамплином обнаружены полурасплавленная рама от велосипеда «Canondale Jekyll 1000» и остатки колес. Трава в радиусе десяти метров вокруг трамплина выжжена, причем выгоревшее пятно имеет форму правильной пятиконечной звезды, за границами которой трава не пострадала. Рядом с велосипедной рамой найдены предметы женской одежды: джинсы, пара кроссовок, трусики типа «неделька» со словом «Воскресенье» и майка с вышитой на груди надписью «скиf».Если судить по фотографиям из протокола, третья буква этого слова больше похожа на кириллическое «И», чем на латинское «U». Можно предположить, что перед нами не анаграмма «fuck», как утверждает в своей монографии М. Лейбман, а слово «скиф». Это подтверждает строка «да, азиаты мы» на спине футболки — несомненная аллюзия на стихотворение А. Блока «Скифы», которого М. Лейбман, судя по всему, не читал.Среди предметов одежды находился рюкзак с портативным компьютером, о котором уже говорилось в протоколе. Все эти вещи не пострадали, и на них не обнаружено следов огня, что свидетельствует — они были подброшены на место происшествия уже после того, как на траве было выжжено звездообразное пятно. По факту данного события уголовного дела возбуждено не было.Судьба находившегося (якобы) на хард-диске текста хорошо известна — сначала он имел хождение в кругах оккультных маргиналов, а затем был издан в качестве книги. Оригинальное название текста показалось непристойным даже нынешним барышникам от книготорговли, поэтому при издании он был переименован в «Священную Книгу Оборотня».Этот текст не заслуживает, конечно, серьезного литературоведческого или критического анализа. Тем не менее, отметим, что в нем просматривается настолько густая сеть заимствований, подражаний, перепевов и аллюзий (не говоря уже о дурном языке и редкостном инфантилизме автора), что вопроса о его аутентичности или подлинности перед серьезным специалистом по литературе не стоит, и интересен он исключительно как симптом глубокого духовного упадка, переживаемого нашим обществом. А псевдовосточная поп-метафизика, шапочным знакомством с которой автору не терпится похвалиться перед такими же унылыми неудачниками, способна вызвать у серьезных и состоявшихся в жизни людей разве что сострадательную улыбку. Хочется уверить москвичей и гостей столицы, что чистота и порядок в Битцевском парке поддерживаются на должном уровне и московская милиция днем и ночью охраняет покой и безопасность прогуливающихся. А самое главное, друзья — чтобы в вашей жизни всегда нашлось место радостной песне!Тенгиз Кокоев, майор, начальник О/M «Битца-центр»Майя Марачарская, Игорь Кошкодавленко, кандидат филологических наукПелдис Шарм, ведущий телепрограммы «Караоке о Главном»",837414212,837414212,Paperback,,352 pages,"

Até agora ninguém o superou em audácia e imaginação.""Henry MillerEmbora tenha parado de escrever aos 21 anos, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-1891) foi uma das vozes poéticas mais talentosas já vistas, e sua pequena obra influenciou os maiores escritores dos séculos XIX e XX. Uma temporada no inferno, de 1873 – aqui em edição bilíngüe –, é o visceral relato em prosa poética do homem perscrutando as suas profundezas e origens. De uma riqueza imagética sem precedentes na literatura, os textos deste livro visitam sonhos e terras distantes, desejo de solidão e sede de conhecimento, o passado ancestral e a busca pelo desconhecido. Deles emerge o homem rebelde e aventureiro, vivendo – como dizia Verlaine a respeito de Rimbaud – a própria “vida inimitável”.",8525406716,9788525406712),Paperback,edição bilíngue,104 pages,"

","The supernatural storm of the century is coming.  Leda’s quest to gain the magic she needs to save her brother leads her to the castle of the Dragons, home of four soldiers in the Legion of Angels with extraordinary powers over the elements. If she makes it through their training, she might just survive her next sip of the gods’ Nectar and level up her magic.  But the gods’ gifts of magic come at a price. Leda can already feel the Nectar changing her, making her less human—and so is her budding romance with the angel Nero. Sip by sip, kiss by kiss, the change is taking hold of her.  As if that’s not enough, Leda finds herself once again caught between the armies of heaven and hell—and tempted by a darkness that threatens to consume the Earth.  Dragon’s Storm is the fourth book in the Legion of Angels series.",,,Kindle Edition,,270 pages,"

","In a remote Polish village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology, translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over humans. Then a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon other bodies are discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit. If only anyone would pay her mind...A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale,  Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead  is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity and madness, justice and tradition, autonomy and fate.

","In this warm, stimulating brew of personal stories, acclaimed author Kathleen Dean Moore uses the metaphor of an island to challenge the cynicism inherent in the Western worldview. A gifted storyteller with a sly sense of humor, Moore explores three separations brought to us by Enlightenment philosophers: the separation of human from nature, of things near and far away, and of the sacred from the mundane. Challenging each, such as Descartes' idea that humans have a discrete consciousness and can alter creation while remaining unaltered themselves, she reveals why such divisions don't tally with the values expressed daily in the way people live. Moore disguises her philosophical explorations in stories: about vacationing on a tiny island in Alaska, visiting her father in the hospital, watching grouse perform their mating dance in the desert. Throughout, she shows that, when properly observed, the world is full of opportunities to find hidden connections.",1571312765,9781571312761),Hardcover,,247 pages,"

Não sabia que teria de trocar a sua vida despreocupada na sociedade cosmopolita de Lisboa por uma missão tão patriótica quanto arriscada na distante ilha de S. Tomé. Não esperava que o cargo de governador e a defesa da dignidade dos trabalhadores das roças o lançassem numa rede de conflitos e interesses com a metrópole. E não contava que a descoberta do amor lhe viesse mudar a vida.Equador é um retrato brilhante da sociedade portuguesa nos últimos dias da Monarquia, que traça um paralelo entre os serões mundanos da capital e o ambiente duro e retrógrado das colónias.É com esta história admirável, comovente e perturbadora, que Miguel Sousa Tavares inaugura a sua incursão no romance.",,,Paperback,Large Print,528 pages,"

My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:

2. My husband doesn’t love me anymore.

3. Sometimes I lie.
Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can’t move. She can’t speak. She can’t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn’t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?",0008225354,9780008225353),Paperback,,387 pages,"

","La quête d'absolu s'accorde mal aux convenances hypocrites en vigueur dans la haute société pétersbourgeoise de cette fin du XIXe siècle. Anna Karénine en fera la douloureuse expérience. Elle qui ne sait ni mentir ni tricher - l'antithèse d'une Bovary - ne peut ressentir qu'un profond mépris pour ceux qui condamnent au nom de la morale sa passion adultère. Et en premier lieu son mari, l'incarnation parfaite du monde auquel il appartient, lui plus soucieux des apparences que véritablement peiné par la trahison d'Anna. Le drame de cette femme intelligente, sensible et séduisante n'est pas d'avoir succombé à la passion dévorante que lui inspire le comte Vronski, mais de lui avoir tout sacrifié, elle, sa vie de femme, sa vie de mère. Vronski, finalement lassé, retrouvera les plaisirs de la vie mondaine. Dans son insondable solitude, Anna, qui ne peut paraître à ses côtés, aura pour seule arme l'humiliante jalousie pour faire vivre les derniers souffles d'un amour en perdition.

","Fantagraphics is proud to re-present Krazy Kat to a new generation of readers. Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect ""her"" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E. Cummings to recognize Herriman's genius almost immediately. Each of Fantagraphics' Krazy Ignatz volumes is designed by Chris Ware, creator of the wildly successful ACME Novelty Library series. This beautiful volume includes material never collected before.",1560973862,9781560973867),Paperback,,120 pages,"

","Under the streets of London there's a world most people could never even dream of. A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, and pale girls in black velvet. Richard Mayhew is a young businessman who is about to find out more than he bargained for about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his safe and predictable life and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and yet utterly bizarre. There's a girl named Door, an Angel called Islington, an Earl who holds Court on the carriage of a Tube train, a Beast in a labyrinth, and dangers and delights beyond imagining... And Richard, who only wants to go home, is to find a strange destiny waiting for him below the streets of his native city.",1472234502,9781472234506),Paperback,,372 pages,"

","Η δίκη του μεγάλου φιλοσόφου και η απολογία του στο δικαστήριο, με την οποία φτάνει στην απόλυτη συνέπεια λόγων και πράξεων. Η κατηγορία εις βάρος του και η αντιμετώπισή της.Ο Πλάτων γεννήθηκε το 427 π.Χ., γόνος επιφανούς Αθηναϊκής οικογένειας. Έλαβε σπουδαία παιδεία και γνώρισε τα Ελληνικά φιλοσοφικά ρεύματα. Αυτό όμως που διαμόρφωσε καθοριστικά την ηθική και πνευματική του υπόσταση ήταν ο Σωκράτης, με τη ζωή, τη φιλοσοφία και τον θάνατό του. Ο μεγάλος φιλόσοφος ήταν αιτία να στραφεί ο νεαρός Πλάτων στη φιλοσοφία, και η Σωκρατική εννοιολογία αποτέλεσε βάση για τη δημιουργία της κατοπινής Πλατωνικής θεωρίας των Ιδεών. Ο Πλάτων ερμήνευσε βαθύτατα τον Σωκράτη ως άνθρωπο και διδάσκαλο, και αποτύπωσε την προσωπικότητά του σε πολλά έργα του. Ταξίδεψε στην Αίγυπτο, την Κυρήνη και τη Μεγάλη Ελλάδα, όπου προσπάθησε, χωρίς επιτυχία να εφαρμόσει τις πολιτικές αρχές του στην οργάνωση των Ελληνικών πόλεων της Σικελίας. Το 387 π.Χ. ίδρυσε στην Αθήνα την Ακαδημία, περίφημο κέντρο της φιλοσοφίας και των Μουσών, που διατηρήθηκε σχεδόν δέκα αιώνες, μέχρι τους χρόνους του Ιουστινιανού. Ο Πλάτων αφοσιώθηκε ως το θάνατό του (348 π.Χ) στη διδασκαλία και τη συγγραφή. Τα έργα του, που σώζονται όλα, ταξινόμησε ο Θράσυλλος σε εννέα τετραλογίες. Όλα σχεδόν ανήκουν στο είδος του διαλόγου, με το οποίο ο Πλάτων αναδείχτηκε, εκτός από κορυφαίος φιλόσοφος, αληθινός ποιητής. Η διδασκαλία του πηγάζει από τα δόγματα της Ελληνικής σκέψης, τον Ορφισμό, την Πυθαγόρεια και την Ιωνική φιλοσοφία και βέβαια τον Σωκρατικό λόγο, και διαμορφώνεται τελικά, ως προσωπική δημιουργία του Πλάτωνος, σε ένα κολοσσιαίο φιλοσοφικό σύστημα. Η φιλοσοφία του - ηθική, οντολογική, πολιτική - είναι το θεμέλιο του παγκόσμιου Ιδεαλισμού και επηρέασε περισσότερο ίσως απ' οποιονδήποτε άλλο τη σκέψη όλων των εποχών.",9603520276,9789603520276),Paperback,,123 pages,"

In the past ten years, this thirty-something has buried four of them, collateral damage in his quest for love. Now he’s heading west to Los Angeles, the city of second chances, determined to put his past behind him.In Hollywood, Joe blends in effortlessly with the other young upstarts. He eats guac, works in a bookstore, and flirts with a journalist neighbor. But while others seem fixated on their own reflections, Joe can’t stop looking over his shoulder. The problem with hidden bodies is that they don’t always stay that way. They re-emerge, like dark thoughts, multiplying and threatening to destroy what Joe wants most: true love. And when he finds it in a darkened room in Soho House, he’s more desperate than ever to keep his secrets buried. He doesn’t want to hurt his new girlfriend—he wants to be with her forever.

","What price perfection?David is an American investment banker living in London; Elizabeth, his wife, is a woman of peerless beauty and refinement. They have two children; their marriage seems perfect. Why does she want him to retire and move home to America? One summer evening, David, alone in their empty mansion, receives a phone call from a long-lost friend. So begins a tale about friendship, marriage, and betrayal that is filled with unexpected reversals.Canarino is a portrait of intimate relationships set in a world of privilege and achievement. Its characters possess personal gifts in dazzling abundance, yet their appetites to succeed, to be exceptional, tempt them to risk everything. What is the cost for the heart of seeking perfection?In Katherine Bucknell’s first novel, beauty and passion are stalked by desolation. Like the drink of the title—boiling water over a twist of lemon peel—the prose has a sharp, delicate clarity. Beneath its polished surface lie psychological depths both uncanny and haunting. Canarino is a novel that lingers in the mind, a remarkable debut.",,,Kindle Edition,,352 pages,"

","Sempre più spesso usiamo con disinvoltura parole e nomi di cui pochissimo sappiamo. Bitcoin, ad esempio. Che cosa sono?

Che cos'ha veramente fatto, Julian Assange? E chi è? Per trovare le prime risposte serviva uno scrittore puro, qualcuno cioè disposto a partire per un viaggio senza mappa, provvisto di un'arma ancora efficace: una qualche confidenza con il romanzesco.

E al suo ritorno, come un esploratore vittoriano, ha steso tre relazioni estremamente accurate, che anche quando sembrano sul punto di sconfinare nella farsa – come nel caso dell'abortita collaborazione con Assange – sono in realtà altrettanti racconti del terrore. Di cui si ha da subito la sensazione, però, di non potere fare a meno.",884593215X,9788845932151),Paperback,La collana dei casi,222 pages,"

","A funny and poignant debut middle-grade novel about a foster-care girl who is placed with a family in the witness protection program, and finds that hiding in plain sight is complicated and dangerous.Nicki Demere is an orphan and a pickpocket. She also happens to be the U.S. Marshals’ best bet to keep a family alive. . . .The marshals are looking for the perfect girl to join a mother, father, and son on the run from the nation’s most notorious criminals. After all, the bad guys are searching for a family with one kid, not two, and adding a streetwise girl who knows a little something about hiding things may be just what the marshals need.Nicki swears she can keep the Trevor family safe, but to do so she’ll have to dodge hitmen, cyberbullies, and the specter of standardized testing, all while maintaining her marshal-mandated B-minus average. As she barely balances the responsibilities of her new identity, Nicki learns that the biggest threats to her family’s security might not lurk on the road from New York to North Carolina, but rather in her own past.",1250107113,9781250107114),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Lost in love and don't know much? Paul Feig knew even less...Like any other red-blooded, straight young man, Paul Feig spent much of his teenage years trying to solve the mystery of women. Unlike most red-blooded, straight teenage boys, however, Paul Feig was sadly at a considerable disadvantage. He was tall and gangly. He had a love for musical theater. And, perhaps the death knell for his burgeoning sex life, Paul was a tap dance student. (And we have the pictures to prove it—see the front cover.)Infused with the same witty and infectiously readable style of his first book, Kick Me, Superstud chronicles the trials and tribulations of Feig’s young dating life with all the same excruciating detail as an on-air gastric bypass—and you just won’t be able to tear yourself away. Feig’s series of shudder-to-think but oddly familiar (come on—we’ve all been dumped by someone we didn’t even like that much) anecdotes include: his first date, at an REO Speedwagon concert with the most endowed girl in school, who leaves him sitting next to a puddle of puke; his first breakup, accomplished by moving across the country; his mortifying date with his secretly bigoted girlfriend; his discovery of a new self-love technique that almost lands him in the hospital; and his less-than-idealistic “first time,” which he nevertheless elevates to biblical proportions. In Superstud, Paul Feig tells all in a hilarious but true testament to geekdom, love, and growing up.",1400051754,9781400051755),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","First published in 1945, ""In Youth Is Pleasure"" is a beautiful and unassuming coming-of-age novel by the English writer and painter Denton Welch (1915-1948). Painfully sensitive and sad Orville Pym is 15 years old, and this novel recounts the summer holiday after his first miserable year at public school--but as in all of Welch's work, what is most important are the details of his characters' surroundings. Welch is a Proustian writer of uncanny powers of observation who, as William S. Burroughs wrote, ""makes the reader aware of the magic that is right under his eyes."" Film director John Waters includes this novel as one of his ""Five Books You Should Read to Live a Happy Life If Something Is Basically the Matter with You,"" and writes: ""Maybe there is no better novel in the world than Denton Welch's ""In Youth Is Pleasure."" Just holding it in my hands, so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger."" Also included in this edition is the first U.S. publication of ""I Left My Grandfather's House."" This first-person account of an idyllic walking tour in the British countryside undertaken when Welch was 18 makes a fascinating companion piece to the fictionalized, though no less autobiographical, ""In Youth Is Pleasure.""",1878972138,9781878972132),Paperback,,272 pages,"

And in this brilliantly reasoned, thought-provoking work we learn why, as he demonstrates how far America has been detoured from its original path and led down the same road that Germany followed to Nazism. Self-sacrifice, Oriental mysticism, racial ""truth,"" the public good, doing one's duty--these are among the seductive catch-phrases that Leonard Peikoff dissects, examining the kind of philosophy they symbolize, the type of thinking that lured Germany to its doom and that he says is now prevalent in the United States.

","Al igual que otras ficciones de Tolstói, esta historia surge de unos hechos reales que le fueron relatados oralmente. Si bien el propio autor no conoció en persona a Hadji Murat, personaje célebre en la guerra del Cáucaso, si que conoció a quienes le conocieron y, tal y como trasluce en sus páginas, Tolstói guarda hacia él una viva simpatía. A lo largo de varios años se documentó exhaustivamente acerca de las gentes y las costumbres de la región, habló con otras personas que participaron en el conflicto y confrontó esas fuentes con su propia experiencia, vivida en esa región entre los años 1851 y 1853, así como su propio conocimiento del alma humana. El relato confronta la visión de la vida sencilla y tradicional de los campesinos cosacos con la de la tumultuosa y variante de los soldados rusos, desplazados a la zona para asimilar una región que sobrevive a pesar del invasor.Esta obra tardía fue publicada tras la muerte del autor. Puede leerse como un auténtico estudio etnológico y sociológico por su carácter costumbrista en la exposición de la vida de los campesinos. Pero hay en ella un inequivoco sesgo político y social y una denuncia del despotismo.",8437614988,9788437614984),Paperback,,206 pages,"

","In a difficult, uncertain time, it takes a person of great courage, such as the Dalai Lama, to give us hope. Regardless of the violence and cynicism we see on television and read about in the news, there is an argument to be made for basic human goodness. The number of people who spend their lives engaged in violence and dishonesty is tiny compared to the vast majority who would wish others only well. According to the Dalai Lama, our survival has depended and will continue to depend on our basic goodness. Ethics for the New Millennium presents a moral system based on universal rather than religious principles. Its ultimate goal is happiness for every individual, irrespective of religious beliefs. Though he himself a practicing Buddhist, the Dalai Lama's teachings and the moral compass that guides him can lead each and every one of us—Muslim, Christian, Jew, Buddhist, or atheist—to a happier, more fulfilling life.His Holiness the Dalai Lama's newest book, The Wisdom of Compassion, is now available from Riverhead Books.",1573228834,9781573228831),Paperback,,237 pages,"

","A delightful mixture of early American know-how and good old-fashioned gentility, Eric Sloane's Do's and Don'ts captures the spirit of bygone America in words and pictures. Combining two of the beloved folk historian's nostalgic how-to guides, this collection offers vintage, homespun advice that recalls ""the joy of doing things not just the old-fashioned way, but plainly the right way.""A shining historical gem, this little book of American lore recalls a more kindly, less hurried time. Lovingly gathered by ""Mr. Americana"" himself from colonial-era almanacs and diaries, hundreds of brief reflections spread time-honored wisdom on everything from curing hiccups, lighting a proper fire, and mending clothing and furniture, to predicting the weather, making soap, and getting rid of ants, bees, swallows — and boring houseguests. Sloane's evocative drawings add the perfect finishing touch.",0486455947,9780486455945),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

","I stood at the window watching the cocoon, which hung in the winter air like an upside–down question mark. That was the moment... I understood. Really understood. Crisis, change, all the myriad upheavals that blister the spirit and leave us groping– they aren't voices simply of pain but also of creativity. And if we would only listen, we might hear such times beckoning us to a season of waiting, to the place of fertile emptiness.Blending her own experiences with an intimate grasp of contemplative spirituality, Sue Monk Kidd relates the passionate and moving tale of her spiritual crisis at midlife, when life seemed to have lost meaning and how her longing for hasty escape from the pain yielded to a discipline of ""active waiting."" Comparing her experience to the formative processes inside a chrysalis on a wintry tree branch, Kidd reflects on the fact that the soul is often symbolized as a butterfly. The simple cocoon, a living parable of waiting, becomes an icon of hope for the transformation that the author sought. Kidd charts her re–ascent from the depths and offers a new understanding of the passage away from the self, which is based upon others' expectations, to the true self of God's unfolding intention. Her wise, inspiring book helps those in doubt and crisis recognize the opportunity to ""dismantle old masks and patterns and unfold a deeper, more authentic self.""",0061144894,9780061144899),Paperback,,240 pages,"

The problem of cooperation is central to many different fields. Robert Axelrod recounts the famous computer tournaments in which the “cooperative” program Tit for Tat recorded its stunning victories, explains its application to a broad spectrum of subjects, and suggests how readers can both apply cooperative principles to their own lives and teach cooperative principles to others.",0465005640,9780465005642),Paperback,Revised Edition,264 pages,"

After a destructive battle, the ancient swaying city of Deepgate has been overtaken. Most of the chains that suspend it have given way, toxic fumes are emanating from blazing structures, and the temple once inhabited by the ruling Presbyter now dangles upside down above the once-uncharted abyss. The victorious Spine have initiated martial law and are ruthlessly pursuing all who attempt to leave. Amid the turmoil, two captives are returned. Arriving by ship are the young angel Dill, now toughened by war, and traitor assassin Rachel Hael. Incarcerated in the slowly crumbling temple, the two await their fate, while from the abyss beneath them ghosts rise—for the death of the god Ulcis has left open the gates to Hell.But on orders from his divine brethren, Cospinol, the god of brine and fog, is traveling the world to Deepgate to seal this breach. His great skyship is being dragged through the air by the giant John Anchor, a monster of a man enslaved to pull the god’s vessel, moving slowly, inevitably, toward the city.As the city waits, teetering on the brink, myriad plans for vengeance are set in motion, from the continent of Pandemeria to Heaven itself. Among them is a ghostly archon sent to deliver a message to the gods on earth—using Dill as his vessel. Thrust from his body, Dill’s own soul returns to Hell. When Dill and Rachel are attacked by Spine assassins, Rachel has no choice but to try to escape with the creature that calls itself Dill…and to somehow find a way to restore her friend’s soul before it’s too late. For powerful forces are stirring, and in the coming battle between gods, it is the world of men that is at stake.From the Hardcover edition.",0553384171,9780553384178),Hardcover,,400 pages,"

","Daddy's Girl is a powerful book that uses a childlike graphic style to explore the adolescence of a young girl, Lily, whose life is being destroyed by sexual abuse. Drechsler pulls no punches in her depiction of incest, and many scenes are hard to read, but this book shows that comics can be a vehicle for serious subjects; the drawings pull the reader into her world more completely than the written word ever could. Drechsler's depiction of childhood is perfect, and there are happy moments within the horror of Lily's life. In one chapter, Lily and a friend contemplate suicide, then walk into the woods, away from their problems. In the last panel, as they sit eating tiny wild strawberries, there is a moment of hope which resonates long after the book is finished.",156097303X,9781560973034),Paperback,,79 pages,"

","When it comes to reporting on politics, nobody does it smarter or funnier than bestselling author Molly Ivins. In Shrub, Ivins focuses her Texas-size smarts on the biggest politician in her home state: George Walker Bush, or ""Shrub,"" as Ivins has nicknamed Bush the Younger.         A candidate of vague speeches and an ambiguous platform, Bush leads the pack of GOP 2000 presidential hopefuls; ""Dubya"" could very well be our next president. What voters need now is an original, smart, and accessible analysis of Bush--one that leaves the ""youthful indiscretions"" to the tabloids and gets to the heart of his policies and motivations. Ivins is the perfect woman for the job.         With her trademark wit and down-home wisdom, Molly Ivins shares three pieces of advice on judging a politician: ""The first is to look at the record. The second is to look at the record. And third, look at the record."" In this book, Ivins takes a good, hard look at the record of the man who could be the leader of the free world. Beginning with his post-college military career, Ivins tracks Dubya's winding, sometimes unlikely path from a failed congressional bid to a two-term governorship. Bush has made plenty of friends and supporters along the way, including Texas oil barons, evangelist Billy Graham, and co-investors in the Texas Rangers baseball team. ""You would have to work at it to dislike the man,"" she writes. But for all of Bush's likeability, Ivins points to a disconcerting lack of political passion from this ascending presidential candidate. In her words, ""If you think his daddy had trouble with 'the vision thing,' wait till you meet this one.""         Witty, trenchant, and on target, Ivins gives a singularly perceptive and entertaining analysis of George W. Bush. To head to the voting booth without it would be downright un-American.From Shrub: The Short but Happy Political Life of George W. Bush""        The past is prologue in politics. If a politician is left, right, weak, strong, given to the waffle or the flip-flop, or, as sometimes happens, an able soul who performs well under pressure, all that will be in the record."" ¸         Bush's welfare record: ""Texas pols like to 'git tuff' on crime, welfare, commies, and other bad stuff. Bush proposed to git tuff on welfare recipients by ending the allowance for each additional child--which in Texas is $38 a month."" ¸         Bush and the Christian right: ""Bush has learned to dance with the Christian right. It has been interesting and amusing to watch the process. Interesting because it's sometimes hard to tell who's leading and who's following; amusing because when a scion of Old Yankee money gets together with a televangelist with too much Elvis, the result is swell entertainment."" ¸         Bush's environmental record: Since Governor Bush's election, Texas air quality has been rated the worst in the nation, leading all fifty states in overall toxic releases, recognized carcinogens in the air, cancer risk, and ten other categories of pollutants. ¸         Bush's military career: ""Bush was promoted as the Texas Air National Guard's anti-drug poster boy, one of life's little ironies given the difficulty he has had answering cocaine questions all these years later. 'George Walker Bush is one member of the younger generation who doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or speed,' reads a Guard press release of 1970. 'Oh, he gets high, all right, but not from narcotics.'""From the Hardcover edition.",0375757147,9780375757143),Paperback,,193 pages,"

With a bracing blend of story, logic, science, and humor, Duncan relates mystical, life-changing fishing adventures; draws incisive portraits of the humans and wild creatures who shaped his destiny; attacks the corporate greed and political folly that have brought whole ecosystems to ruin; and meditates on the spiritual and practical necessity of acknowledging our dependence on water in its primal state.",1578050499,9781578050499),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","In this debut work by New York Times-bestselling author Paul Auster (The New York Trilogy), The Invention of Solitude, a memoir, established Auster’s reputation as a major new voice in American writing. His moving and personal meditation on fatherhood is split into two stylistically separate sections. In the first, Auster reflects on the memories of his father who was a distant, undemonstrative, and cold man who died an untimely death. As he sifts through his Father’s things, Auster uncovers a sixty-year-old murder mystery that sheds light on his father’s elusive character. In the second section, the perspective shifts and Auster begins to reflect on his own identity as a father by adopting the voice of a narrator, “A.” Through a mosaic of images, coincidences, and associations “A,” contemplates his separation from his son, his dying grandfather, turning the story into a self-conscious reflection on the process of writing.",0143112228,9780143112228),Paperback,,192 pages,"

Her life in rural Tennessee was filled with family, friends, school, cheerleading, and the daily tasks of living on a farm. And then came a little show called ""Hannah Montana."" Almost overnight, Miley would rocket to superstardom, becoming a television and singing phenomenon. Quiet days were replaced with sold-out concerts, television appearances, and magazine shoots. But through it all, Miley has remained close to her family and friends and has stayed connected to the Southern roots that made her so strong. In Miles to Go, Miley offers an honest, humorous, and often touching story of one girl's coming-of-age--from private moments with her pappy to off-roading with her dad, Billy Ray, to her run-ins with mean girls. Miley talks about suffering through drama and heartbreak and coming out the other end unscathed (relatively). And now for the first time, she will discuss it all-the milestones still left to reach (driver's license! voting!), dreams to live out (travel to Asia! find true love!), and the lessons to be learned (remembernig to enjoy every moment!).

","NATIONAL BESTSELLER""[A]n extraordinary book, a work of staggering virtuosity. With its publication, a giant world of literature has just grown twice as tall.""--NewsdayFrom Ralph Ellison--author of the classic novel of African-American experience, Invisible Man--the long-awaited second novel. Here is the master of American vernacular--the rhythms of jazz and gospel and ordinary speech--at the height of his powers, telling a powerful, evocative tale of a prodigal of the twentieth century.""Tell me what happened while there's still time,"" demands the dying Senator Adam Sunraider to the itinerate Negro preacher whom he calls Daddy Hickman. As a young man, Sunraider was Bliss, an orphan taken in by Hickman and raised to be a preacher like himself. Bliss's history encompasses the joys of young southern boyhood; bucolic days as a filmmaker, lovemaking in a field in the Oklahoma sun. And behind it all lies a mystery: how did this chosen child become the man who would deny everything to achieve his goals? Brilliantly crafted, moving, wise, Juneteenth is the work of an American master.",0375707549,9780375707544),Paperback,,400 pages,"

Living a secluded life in the wilds of Yorkshire with her sisters Emily and Anne, their drug-addicted brother, and an eccentric father who is going blind, Charlotte Bronte dreams of a real love story as fiery as the ones she creates.But it is in the pages of her diary where Charlotte exposes her deepest feelings and desires—and the truth about her life, its triumphs and shattering disappointments, her family, the inspiration behind her work, her scandalous secret passion for the man she can never have . . . and her intense, dramatic relationship with the man she comes to love, the enigmatic Arthur Bell Nicholls.""Who is this man who has dared to ask for my hand? Why is my father so dead set against him? Why are half the residents of Haworth determined to lynch him—or shoot him?""From Syrie James, the acclaimed, bestselling author of The Lost Memoirs of Jane Austen, comes a powerfully compelling, intensely researched literary feat that blends historical fact and fiction to explore the passionate heart and unquiet soul of Charlotte Bronte.

","On 7 August 1889, an American woman, Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, was sentenced to death in a court in Liverpool, England, for a crime she did not commit. She was condemned for the murder of her husband. Her husband was Jack the Ripper.This book reveals how the largest and most detailed investigation ever undertaken on the subject of the Ripper Murders led the author to the story of Florence and how she was framed for the murder of her husband, James Maybrick, as part of an official cover which continues to this day.The key to this extraordinary story is the Diary Of Jack the Ripper. When this remarkable documents first came to light, Paul H. Feldman set out to prove that it was a hoax. He couldn't. In fact, the more he researched the Diary, the more he became convinced that it was genuine, that it was written by James Maybrick and that Maybrick was the Ripper. Now he has proved it.Feldman explains exactly why the Ripper murders always been shrouded in secrecy, why there was an official cover-up, why there have always been rumors of links to the British Royal Family, why there has always been speculation about Masonic involvement and why an innocent American was sentenced to death for a crime that she did not commit.As well as providing the long-awaited solution to one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of crime, this is a story about real people. Feldman's research draws in people alive today who are descended from Florence, and others descended from James Maybrick the living descendants of Jack The Ripper.",0753502720,9780753502723),Paperback,,457 pages,"

For Chernyshevsky's novel, far more than Marx's Capital, supplied the emotional dynamic that eventually went to make the Russian Revolution.""--Joseph Frank, The Southern ReviewAlmost from the moment of its publication in 1863, Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, What Is to Be Done?, had a profound impact on the course of Russian literature and politics. The idealized image it offered of dedicated and self-sacrificing intellectuals transforming society by means of scientific knowledge served as a model of inspiration for Russia's revolutionary intelligentsia. On the one hand, the novel's condemnation of moderate reform helped to bring about the irrevocable break between radical intellectuals and liberal reformers; on the other, Chernyshevsky's socialist vision polarized conservatives' opposition to institutional reform. Lenin himself called Chernyshevsky ""the greatest and most talented representative of socialism before Marx""; and the controversy surrounding What Is to Be Done? exacerbated the conflicts that eventually led to the Russian Revolution.Michael R. Katz's readable and compelling translation is now the definitive unabridged English-language version, brilliantly capturing the extraordinary qualities of the original. William G. Wagner has provided full annotations to Chernyshevsky's allusions and references and to the, sources of his ideas, and has appended a critical bibliography. An introduction by Katz and Wagner places the novel in the context of nineteenth-century Russian social, political, and intellectual history and literature, and explores its importance for several generations of Russian radicals.",0801495474,9780801495472),Paperback,,445 pages,"

","At fifteen, Natalie Ward believes her life is perfect. Growing up on a dairy farm in the mountains of British Columbia less than two miles from the American border, she knows little of the outside world. But she knows family. A family so close and loving that they are the envy of the nearby town of Atwood. Friends and neighbors, young and old alike, show up regularly on their farmhouse porch–all willing to share in the never-ending daily chores in exchange for a place at the Ward family table. Natalie cherishes her position as the only daughter of the beautiful Nettie Ward–the pride of the Catholic Ladies Auxiliary–and the town's milkman, Gus Ward–the darling of Atwood housewives. She adores her three brothers, especially the eldest, Boyer, whom she idolizes with a childlike worship. Like her mother, Natalie believes their lives are blessed, as rich and as sweet as the fresh milk that is their livelihood. Everything changes one hot July afternoon in 1966 when a long-haired stranger walks up the winding dirt road to their door. The arrival of this soft-spoken American, a Vietnam War resister, will test the morals and beliefs of the Ward family and their close-knit community. The catastrophic events that are set in motion will leave relationships shattered and Natalie separated from the family she loves in ways that she could never have imagined. Thirty-five years later, Natalie receives a late-night phone call from her now-estranged brother Boyer. Their mother is dying. Torn between the love of her mother and the fear of the past, Natalie returns to the town she has spent her entire adult life avoiding. As she travels back to her childhood home she steels herself against the bittersweet memories of that summer day in 1966 and the tragedy that followed. But before Natalie can find redemption, she must confront the secrets and horrors of a past she has desperately tried to forget.",1554681669,9780061462993),,,311 pages,"

","""These notes are about the process of design: the process of inventing things which display new physical order, organization, form, in response to function."" This book, opening with these words, presents an entirely new theory of the process of design.In the first part of the book, Christopher Alexander discusses the process by which a form is adapted to the context of human needs and demands that has called it into being. He shows that such an adaptive process will be successful only if it proceeds piecemeal instead of all at once. It is for this reason that forms from traditional un-self-conscious cultures, molded not by designers but by the slow pattern of changes within tradition, are so beautifully organized and adapted. When the designer, in our own self-conscious culture, is called on to create a form that is adapted to its context he is unsuccessful, because the preconceived categories out of which he builds his picture of the problem do not correspond to the inherent components of the problem, and therefore lead only to the arbitrariness, willfulness, and lack of understanding which plague the design of modern buildings and modern cities.In the second part, Mr. Alexander presents a method by which the designer may bring his full creative imagination into play, and yet avoid the traps of irrelevant preconception. He shows that, whenever a problem is stated, it is possible to ignore existing concepts and to create new concepts, out of the structure of the problem itself, which do correspond correctly to what he calls the subsystems of the adaptive process. By treating each of these subsystems as a separate subproblem, the designer can translate the new concepts into form. The form, because of the process, will be well-adapted to its context, non-arbitrary, and correct.The mathematics underlying this method, based mainly on set theory, is fully developed in a long appendix. Another appendix demonstrates the application of the method to the design of an Indian village.",0674627512,9780674627512),Paperback,,224 pages,"

(D&C 88:63.) In To Draw Closer to God, Elder Henry B. Eyring explains some of the ways we can claim these promises. In his thoughtful, spiritual style, he discusses such topics as learning to hear the Lord's voice, choosing to be good, overcoming trials of faith, strengthening the family, surrendering to Christ, and helping others draw closer to the Lord. Elder Eyring writes, ""Yield your heart unto God. Ask him what it is he would have you do. Know that he will have prepared a way for you to do it, even under great difficulties. Ask him how he would have you share what you have with others, and you will feel his love. He lives and he loves you. He wants you to come home again.""

","What happens to a child when her own parents reject her and sit idly by as others abuse her? In this poignant, heart wrenching debut work, Regina Louise recounts her childhood search for someone to feel connected to. A mother she has never known--but long fantasized about-- deposited her and her half sister at the same group home that she herself fled years before. When another resident beats Regina so badly that she can barely move, she knows that she must leave this terrible place-the only home she knows. Thus begins Regina's fight to survive, utterly alone at the age of 10. A stint living with her mother and her abusive boyfriend is followed by a stay with her father's lily white wife and daughters, who ignore her before turning to abuse and ultimately kicking her out of the house. Regina then tries everything in her search for someone to care for her and to care about, from taking herself to jail to escaping countless foster homes to be near her beloved counselor. Written in her distinctive and unique voice, Regina's story offers an in-depth look at the life of a child who no one wanted. From her initial flight to her eventual discovery of love, your heart will go out to Regina's younger self, and you'll cheer her on as she struggles to be Somebody's Someone.",0446529109,9780446529105),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

The secrets of the dead are in her hands.
  The bones of three young women are unearthed in the basement of a Montreal pizza parlor, and forensic anthropologist Tempe Brennan has unsolved murder on her mind as she examines the shallowly buried remains. Coming up against a homicide cop who is convinced the dead have been entombed on the site for centuries, Tempe perseveres, even with her own relationship with Detective Andrew Ryan at a delicate turning point. In the lab, the clean, well-perserved bones offer few clues. But when Carbon 14 confirms her hunch that these were recent deaths despite the antique buttons found near the bodies, Tempe's probing must produce answers quickly to stop a killer whose grisly handiwork has seen the light of day.",0743453018,9780743453011),Paperback,,383 pages,"

A younger son of a younger son from a backwater mountain province, he is a nobody in the king’s army until he comes to the notice of the Prince Knight himself, the spoiled, stubborn heir to the kingdom of Aldania.Caught up in a war that has raged for generations between Aldania and a neighboring kingdom, captured and imprisoned by a mad king, Illya and Prince Ashe discover a history of lies, betrayal and assassination, and the ghostly truth beneath it all. Opposites in every way, they forge a common bond that pain, war and betrayal will test to the very limit of their strength. To end a dynasty of madness and suffering, Illya must embrace the ability he has always hated, and look to the dead for answers.",,,ebook,,688 pages,"

","When lives are dominated by hunger, what becomes of love? When assaulted by daily acts of violence and untimely death, what happens to trust? Set in the lands of Northeast Brazil, this is an account of the everyday experience of scarcity, sickness and death that centres on the lives of the women and children of a hillside ""favela"". Bringing her readers to the impoverished slopes above the modern plantation town of Bom Jesus de Mata, where she has worked on and off for 25 years, Nancy Scheper-Hughes follows three generations of shantytown women as they struggle to survive through hard work, cunning and triage. It is a story of class relations told at the most basic level of bodies, emotions, desires and needs. Most disturbing – and controversial – is her finding that mother love, as conventionally understood, is something of a bourgeois myth, a luxury for those who can reasonably expect, as these women cannot, that their infants will live.",0520075374,9780520075375),Paperback,,632 pages,"

The fifth part of Cao Xueqin's magnificent saga, ""The Dreamer Awakes"", was carefully edited and completed by Gao E some decades later. It continues the story of the changing fortunes of the Jia dynasty, focussing on Bao-yu, now married to Bao-chai, after the tragic death of his beloved Dai-yu. Against such worldly elements as death, financial ruin, marriage, decadence and corruption, his karmic journey unfolds. Like a sleepwalker through life, Bao-yu is finally awakened by a vision, which reveals to him that life itself is merely a dream, 'as moonlight mirrored in the water'.",0140443266,9780140443264),Paperback,,603 pages,"

","A revealing look at Iran by an American journalist with an insider’s access behind Persian wallsThe grandson of an eminent ayatollah and the son of an Iranian diplomat, now an American citizen, Hooman Majd is, in a way, both 100 percent Iranian and 100 percent American, combining an insider’s knowledge of how Iran works with a remarkable ability to explain its history and its quirks to Western readers. In The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, he paints a portrait of a country that is fiercely proud of its Persian heritage, mystified by its outsider status, and scornful of the idea that the United States can dictate how it should interact with the community of nations.With wit, style, and an unusual ability to get past the typical sound bite on Iran, Majd reveals the paradoxes inherent in the Iranian character which have baffled Americans for more than thirty years. Meeting with sartorially challenged government officials in the presidential palace; smoking opium with an addicted cleric, his family, and friends; drinking fine whiskey at parties in fashionable North Tehran; and gingerly self-flagellating in a celebration of Ashura, Majd takes readers on a rare tour of Iran and shares insights shaped by his complex heritage. He considers Iran as a Muslim country, as a Shiite country, and, perhaps above all, as a Persian one. Majd shows that as Shiites marked by an inferiority complex, and Persians marked by a superiority complex, Iranians are fiercely devoted to protecting their rights, a factor that has contributed to their intransigence over their nuclear programs. He points to the importance of the Persian view of privacy, arguing that the stability of the current regime owes much to the freedom Iranians have to behave as they wish behind “Persian walls.” And with wry affection, Majd describes the Persian concept of ta’arouf, an exaggerated form of polite self-deprecation that may explain some of Iranian President Ahmadinejad’s more bizarre public moments. With unforgettable portraits of Iranians, from government figures to women cab drivers to reform-minded Ayatollahs, Majd brings to life a country that is deeply religious yet highly cosmopolitan, authoritarian yet with democratic and reformist traditions—an Iran that is a more nuanced nemesis to the United States than it is typically portrayed to be.",0385523343,9780385523349),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","A beloved American writer whose books are championed by critics and readers alike, Sherman Alexie has been hailed by Time as ""one of the better new novelists, Indian or otherwise."" In these stories, we meet the kind of American Indians we rarely see in literature -- the kind who pay their bills, hold down jobs, fall in and out of love. A Spokane Indian journalist transplanted from the reservation to the city picks up a hitchhiker, a Lummi boxer looking to take on the toughest Indian in the world. A Spokane son waits for his diabetic father to come home from the hospital, tossing out the Hershey Kisses the father has hidden all over the house. An estranged interracial couple, separated in the midst of a traffic accident, rediscover their love for each other. A white drifter holds up an International House of Pancakes, demanding a dollar per customer and someone to love, and emerges with $42 and an overweight Indian he dubs Salmon Boy. Sherman Alexie's voice is one of remarkable passion, and these stories are love stories -- between parents and children, white people and Indians, movie stars and ordinary people. Witty, tender, and fierce, The Toughest Indian in the World is a virtuoso performance by one of the country's finest writers.",0802138004,9780802138002),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","From the New York Times bestselling author of MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror. Mayan legend tells of the Hero Twins, destined to confront the Lords of the Underworld and rescue their long-lost father from the realm of darkness. A two-thousand-year-old myth-or a prophecy of an apocalyptic battle for the soul of mankind? On December 21, 2012, a date long foretold by the Mayan calendar, Michael Gabriel disappeared from the face of the Earth after saving the entire planet from thermonuclear destruction. Less than a year later, his bereaved wife gave birth to twin sons, both possessed of extraordinary mental and physical gifts. Are these at last the Hero Twins? As crucial as the twins are, they are not unique. A third child has been born, blessed-or cursed-with the same superhuman talent and potential. Born into poverty, raised in obscurity, the seductive Lilith may be the key to humanity's ultimate future. Once again, as in Domain, Steve Alten has ingeniously woven the mysteries of the past into a gripping and unforgettable vision of the future.",0312875584,9780312875589),Hardcover,,,"

","Edgar Allan Poe: Selected Poems and Tales/Deluxe -- FROM THE PUBLISHER:For more than a century-and-a-half, Edgar Allan Poe's poems and tales have thrilled readers with chilling accounts of matters mysterious and macabre. Their somber poetry and rich moods of menace and melancholy have conjured some of the most haunting images in American literature: the accusing echo of the tell-tale heart, the beloved but doomed Annabel Lee, the gloom-shrouded House of Usher, the maddening tortures of the pit and pendulum, the eerie and enigmatic Raven.Dramatic and irreversible, Poe's work invites us to match our darkest imaginings to his vision of the world colored by grief and madness and haunted by specters of guilt and death. This illustrated edition captures Poe's best-known works in all their shadowy splendor through the incomparable art of Mark Summers. His striking full-page color illustrations and ghostly black-and-white pencil sketches reveal the skull beneath the skin of Poe's obsessed and mournful characters and subtly express their heart of emotional darkness that gives them life and purpose.The book also features and introduction by best-selling fantasist and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman, who discusses his personal relationship with Poe's writing and its enduring impact. ""Poe"", he writes, ""for all his short life and unfulfilled potential, remains as much read today, his finest stories as successful, as readable, as contemporary as anyone can desire."" This new edition of Poe's unforgettable writing is a colorful and imaginative tribute to this most contemporary of classic writers.",0760756740,9780760756744),Hardcover,deluxe,256 pages,"

","A new edition of the Fantasy Tales that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft A pioneer in the realm of imaginative literature, Lord Dunsany has gained a cult following for his influence on modern fantasy literature, including such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft. This unique collection of short stories ranges over five decades of work. Liberal selections of earlier tales—including the entire Gods of Pegana as well as such notable works as ""Idle Days of the Yann"" and ""The Fortress Unvanquishable, Save for Sacnoth""—are followed by memorable later tales, including several about the garrulous traveler Joseph Jorkens and the outrageous murder tale ""The Two Bottles of Relish."" Throughout, the stories are united by Dunsany's cosmic vision, his impeccable and mellifluous prose, and his distinctively Irish sense of whimsy.Here published for the first time by Penguin Classics, this edition is the only annotated version of Dunsany's short stories. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

","In the first pages of Rogue River Feud, Grey paints a tantalizing picture of the Rogue from its headwaters to where it spills into the Pacific Ocean.Zane Grey’s vigorous storytelling and portrayal of ... the wild make this novel one of his best. There is a deep emotional feeling for nature in the raw, for the great salmon runs, and for the clashes of men fighting for gold.Along the notorious Rogue River, gold seekers, crazed by the discovery of nuggets that made them rich overnight, are at war with one another. The river itself swarms with salmon, bringing along with them another kind of wealth and violent fighting between fishermen and the fish-packing monopoly. Into this scene comes Keven Bell, returning to face life after being handicapped by a disfiguring wound he received in World War I. Keven teams up with a broken-down fisherman and boatbuilder. When they try to buck the salmon-packing monopoly, they encounter violence and trickery; their boat is sunk and they are left to swim for their lives.Keven is tended to by Beryl, the daughter of a gold miner. His convalescence is slow, but the autumn days, fishing and camping, make a woodland dream of romance. But no sooner has an operation straightened out Keven’s injuries than he is framed on a charge of murder in the salmon-packing war. Keven must carry on as best he can, along with what help Beryl and her old father can give, to clear his name and ensure his and Beryl’s safety on the turbulent Rogue.This text refers to an alternate edition.",0061002143,9780061002144),Paperback,,320 pages,"

But a dark storm of bloodshed and betrayal is closing in, as a merciless band of Vikings threatens the Highlands. Margaret is determined to hold the MacDonald clan together and to locate her abducted younger brother. But can she trust the noblemen from King Alexander's court, who insist that only by adhering to a betrothal conceived for political gain will she find safety? Or should she put her trust in an imposing half-Irish, half-Norse warrior? Gannon MacMagnus alone offers her hope of reuniting her family and vanquishing the barbarous Norsemen who would continue to rob her people of their God-given right to determine their own destinies. In whom should Margaret entrust the fate of the rugged, magnificent land she calls home?",1416509909,9781416509905),Paperback,,400 pages,"

In Reading the Bible Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg shows how instead we can freshly appreciate all the essential elements of the Old and New Testaments—from Genesis to Revelation—in a way that can open up a new world of intelligent faith.In Reading the Bible Again for the First Time, Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile a scientific and critical way of thinking with our deepest spiritual needs, leading to an insightful experience of ancient text. This unique book invites every reader—whatever his or her religious background—to engage the Bible, to wrestle with its meaning, to explore its mysteries, and to understand its relevance. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh, new way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up the rich possibility of living a life of authentic faith.",0060609192,9780060609191),Paperback,,321 pages,"

","Newsweek called renowned minister Timothy Keller ""a C. S. Lewis for the twenty-first century"" in a feature on his first book, The Reason for God. In that book, he offered a rational explanation of why we should believe in God. Now, in The Prodigal God, he uses one of the best-known Christian parables to reveal an unexpected message of hope and salvation.Taking his trademark intellectual approach to understanding Christianity, Keller uncovers the essential message of Jesus, locked inside his most familiar parable. Within that parable Jesus reveals God's prodigal grace toward both the irreligious and the moralistic. This book will challenge both the devout and skeptics to see Christianity in a whole new way.Look out for Timothy Keller's latest book, The Songs of Jesus, coming from Viking on November 10, 2015.",0525950796,9780525950790),Hardcover,,139 pages,"

","Three prolific authors bring truth to the title of this heart-wrenching book, Love Is Never Painless, with a collection of novellas that explores the deeper side of love -- the side rarely explored in love stories.  In Eileen M. Johnson's ""How the Other Half Lives,"" longtime friends Jamellah and Fernecia are having trouble with the men in their lives. And as their worlds seem to crumble, they must count on their friendship to keep it together.  In ""Love Is 2 Blame,"" by V. Anthony Rivers, Malcolm is devastated after his two-year relationship with Shaylisa ends. And trying to move on will not be easy -- but the lovely Zahara may be the perfect woman to show Malcolm what true love is all about.  In Zane's ""Staring Evil in the Face,"" Robier has everything: a successful career, beautiful children, and the woman of his dreams. Having loved Tiphanie since college, he is determined to keep his marital vows -- until Tiphanie is involved in a horrible car accident that changes the entire course of their lives.  From nervous breakdowns to drug addiction, in Love Is Never Painless, Zane, Johnson, and Rivers have penned powerful stories that not only will have readers talking, but will bring a new perspective to their own relationships.",1416543708,9781416543701),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","The Southpaw is a story about coming of age in America by way of the baseball diamond. Lefthander Henry Wiggen, six feet three, a hundred ninety-five pounds, and the greatest pitcher going, grows to manhood in a right-handed world. From his small-town beginnings to the top of the game, Henry finds out how hard it is to please his coach, his girl, and the sports page—and himself, too—all at once. Written in Henry’s own words, this exuberant, funny novel follows his eccentric course from bush league to the World Series. Although Mark Harris loves and writes tellingly about the pleasures of baseball, his primary subject has always been the human condition and the shifts of mortal men and women as they try to understand and survive what life has dealt them. This new Bison Books edition celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of The Southpaw. In his introduction to this edition, Mark Harris discusses the genesis of the novel in his own life experience. Also available in Bison Books editions are The Southpaw, It Looked Like For Ever, and A Ticket for a Seamstitch, the other three volumes in the Henry Wiggen series.",0803273371,9780803273375),Paperback,Second Edition,350 pages,"

","A haunting and triumphant story of a difficult and keenly felt life, ""Change Me into Zeus's Daughter"" is a remarkable literary memoir of resilience, redemption, and growing up in the South. Barbara Robinette Moss was the fourth in a family of eight children raised in the red-clay hills of Alabama. Their wild-eyed, alcoholic father was a charismatic and irrationally proud man who, when sober, captured his children's timid awe, but when (more often) drunk, roused them from bed for severe punishment or bizarre all-night poker games. Their mother was their angel: erudite and stalwart -- her only sin her inability to leave her husband for the sake of the children. Unlike the rest of her family, Barbara bore the scars of this abuse and neglect on the outside as well as the inside. As a result of childhood malnutrition and a complete lack of medical and dental care, the bones in her face grew abnormally (""like a thin pine tree""), and she ended up with what she calls ""a twisted, mummy face."" Barbara's memoir brings us deep into not only the world of Southern poverty and alcoholic child abuse but also the consciousness of one who is physically frail and awkward, relating how one girl's debilitating sense of her own physical appearance is ultimately saved by her faith in the transformative powers of artistic beauty: painting and writing.From early on and with little encouragement from the world, Barbara embodied the fiery determination to change her fate and achieve a life defined by beauty. At age seven, she announced to the world that she would become an artist -- and so she did. Nightly, she prayed to become attractive, to be changed into ""Zeus's daughter,"" the goddess of beauty, and when her prayers weren't answered, she did it herself, raising the money for years of braces followed by facial surgery. Growing up ""so ugly,"" she felt the family's disgrace all the more acutely, but the result has been a keenly developed appreciation for beauty -- physical and artistic -- the evidence of which can be seen in her writing.Despite the deprivation, the lingering image from this memoir is not of self-pity but of the incredible bond between these eight siblings: the raucous, childish fun they had together, the making-do, and the total devotion to their desperate mother, who absorbed most of the father's blows for them and who plied them with art and poetry in place of balanced meals. Gracefully and intelligently woven in layers of flashback, the persistent strength of Barbara Moss's memoir is itself a testament to the nearly lifesaving appreciation for literature that was her mother's greatest gift to her children.",074320218X,9780743202183),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

Cest un livre qui est donc animé par une idée unique, une unité plus forte peut-être que jamais ; et pourtant, cest dabord un recueil dessais (le deuxième après Lénergie spirituelle de 1919), dont chacun (plus encore que dans le précédent) vaut comme une uvre décisive à part entière, dont certains (comme lIntroduction à la métaphysique) ont déjà marqué leur époque, et qui, enfin, ne sont pas reliés entre eux seulement par cette unité de principe, mais aussi par des tensions, non moins profondes. Ainsi Bergson resserre-t-il encore, plus que jamais, sa pensée ou son intuition, la prenant directement, pour la première fois, comme objet. Il restreint même, en apparence, la portée de ce recueil, en la limitant, dans lAvant-propos, à une réflexion, rétrospective, sur sa « méthode ».

","In 1978, when Michael Hart's controversial book The 100 was first published, critics objected that Hart had the nerve not only to select who he thought were the most influential people in history, but also to rank them according to their importance. Needless to say, the critics were wrong, and to date more than 60,000 copies of the book have been sold. Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publications of this revised and updated edition of The 100.As before, Hart's yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history. With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world's greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators--from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches. Hart's selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer's arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining. The 100, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor--a perfect addition to any history or philosophy reference section.",0806513500,9780806513508),Paperback,,556 pages,"

So when a snooping Outsider comes to Grundy to investigate rumors of lycanthropic shenanigans in the area, the valley’s pack alpha, Maggie Graham, resolves to chase him away, even if doing so takes a quick bite on the butt. What a pity that researcher Nick Thatcher turns out to be so drool-worthy, and that his kisses make Maggie want to sit up and beg. Maggie just can’t seem to convince Nick to leave . . . and even worse, she can’t convince herself to stay away from him. Cross-species dating is problem enough for a harried alpha female, but on top of that, a rival group of werewolves is trying to move into the valley. With interpack war threatening, Maggie can’t afford to be distracted.

","Happiness. It's what we all long for, what all human beings seek in our jobs, our relationships, our activities. We try so hard to be happy, and all too often we end up empty and unsatisfied. Why? Because, says Billy Graham in this classic work, we are looking for happiness in all the wrong places. We haven't learned the secret Jesus taught in the Beatitudes – that true, lasting happiness simply isn't to be found by seeking it directly. Happiness is a by-product, a bonus that comes when we seek what is really important. And the things that will bring us the satisfaction we long for are not necessarily what the world considers meaningful.Jesus did not have to have an outward stimulus to make Him happy, Billy Graham points out. ""He had learned a secret that allowed Him to live above the circumstances of life and fear of the future. He moved with calmness, certainty, and serenity through the most trying circumstances – even death! What was His secret? He gave it to us in the Beautitudes.""Presented with Billy Graham's characteristic vigor and simplicity in this landmark book, it is a secret that can transform your life.",0849943817,9781593280673),Paperback,,176 pages,"

","In a world where the strident demands of Islamic extremists capture the media’s attention, the courageous protests of Muslim reformers barely receive any notice. These include a surprising number of women who are prepared to challenge institutionalized persecution, risking derision, arrest, physical harm, and even death.In this inspiring compilation of Muslim women’s stories from around the world, the voices of these long-oppressed women ring loud and clear as they question ideology and culture, patriarchal and religious beliefs, and demand the social and political rights women lack in many Muslim countries. The reformers speak out with passion, humanity, and sometimes humor in these compact and often poignant biographies, bringing alive the harsh realities for women in many parts of the world. By surveying a wide range of Muslim reformers, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and North America, author Ida Lichter uncovers some significant emerging trends. For example, she notes that the majority of Muslim feminists would like to see reform contained within Islam. Many criticize their patriarchal culture for suppressing egalitarian views that they believe the Koran expresses and so they advocate a reinterpretation of the holy text. Some demand changes to discriminatory Sharia-based laws. Others campaign openly for political and educational reforms.Complete with a glossary and a list of helpful Web sites, this vibrant anthology makes use of reliable translations from original languages to demonstrate the groundswell of grassroots change that promises eventually to bring even the most conservative sectors of Islam into the twenty-first century.",1591027160,9781591027164),Hardcover,,513 pages,"

","Some have claimed that'War is too important to be left to the generals, 'but P. W. Singer asks'What about the business executives?'Breaking out of the guns-for-hire mold of traditional mercenaries, corporations now sell skills and services that until recently only state militaries possessed. Their products range from trained commando teams to strategic advice from generals.This new'Privatized Military Industry'encompasses hundreds of companies, thousands of employees, and billions of dollars in revenue. Whether as proxies or suppliers, such firms have participated in wars in Africa, Asia, the Balkans, and Latin America. More recently, they have become a key element in U.S. military operations. Private corporations working for profit now sway the course of national and international conflict, but the consequences have been little explored.In this book, Singer provides the first account of the military services industry and its broader implications. Corporate Warriors includes a description of how the business works, as well as portraits of each of the basic types of companies: military providers that offer troops for tactical operations; military consultants that supply expert advice and training; and military support companies that sell logistics, intelligence, and engineering.The privatization of warfare allows startling new capabilities and efficiencies in the ways that war is carried out. At the same time, however, Singer finds that the entrance of the profit motive onto the battlefield raises a series of troubling questions'for democracy, for ethics, for management, for human rights, and for national security.",0801441145,9780801441141),Hardcover,,330 pages,"

","There Are Only 13 Bullets Between the World You Know and the World They RuleAll the official reports say they are dead - extinct since the late '80s, when a fed named Arkeley nailed the last vampire in a fight that nearly killed him. But the evidence proves otherwise.When a state trooper named Caxton calls the FBI looking for help in the middle of the night, it is Arkeley who gets the assignment - who else? He's been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don't: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that only the undead can.Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little afraid, but the fed made it plain that there is only one way out. But the worst thing is the feeling that the vampires want more than just her blood. They want her for a reason, one she can't guess; a reason her sphinxlike partner knows but won't say; a reason she has to find out - or die trying.Now there are only 13 bullets between Caxton and Arkeley and the vampires. There are only 13 bullets between us, the living, and them, the damned.",0307381439,9780307381439),Paperback,,323 pages,"

","It is the young men born into the false prosperity of the 1920s and brought up in the bitter realities of the Depression of the 1930s that this book is about. The literature they read as youngsters was anti-war and cynical, portraying patriots as suckers, slackers and heroes. None of them wanted to be part of another war. They wanted to be throwing baseballs, not handgrenades; shooting .22s at rabbits, not M-1s at other young men.

","The only thing Avery Hood can remember about the night her parents died is that she saw silver-deadly silver, moving inhumanly fast. As much as she wants to remember who killed them, she can't, and there's nothing left to do but try to piece her life back together. Then Avery meets the new boy in school-Ben, mysterious and beautiful, with whom she feels a connection like nothing she's ever experienced. When Ben reveals he's a werewolf, Avery still trusts him-at first. Then she sees that sometimes his eyes flash inhuman silver. And she learns that she's not the only one who can't remember the night her parents died.Part murder mystery, part grief narrative, and part heart-stopping, headlong romance, Low Red Moon is a must-read for teen paranormal fans.

Seyonne has made peace with his fate. With strict self-discipline he forces himself to exist only in the present moment and to avoid the pain of hope or caring about anyone.

","In the Hugo-Award winning Hominids, Robert J. Sawyer introduced a character readers will never forget: Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist from a parallel Earth who was whisked from his reality into ours by a quantum-computing experiment gone awry - making him the ultimate stranger in a strange land.In that book and in its sequel, Humans, Sawyer showed us the Neanderthal version of Earth in loving detail - a tour de force of world-building; a masterpiece of alternate history.Now, in Hybrids, Ponter Boddit and his Homo sapiens lover, geneticist Mary Vaughan, are torn between two worlds, struggling to find a way to make their star-crossed relationship work. Aided by banned Neanderthal technology, they plan to conceive the first hybrid child, a symbol of hope for the joining of their two versions of reality. But after an experiment shows that Mary's religious faith - something completely absent in Neanderthals - is a quirk of the neurological wiring of Homo sapiens brains, Ponter and Mary must decide whether their child should be predisposed to atheism or belief. Meanwhile, as Mary's Earth is dealing with a collapse of its planetary magnetic field, her boss, the enigmatic Jock Krieger, has turned envious eyes on the unspoiled Eden that is the Neanderthal world . . . Hybrids is filled to bursting with Sawyer's signature speculations about alternative ways of being human, exploding our preconceptions of morality and gender, of faith and love. His Neanderthal Parallax trilogy is a classic in the making, and here he brings it to a stunning, thought-provoking conclusion that's sure to make Hybrids one of the most controversial books of the year.",076534906X,9780765349064),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Another rediscovered masterpiece from the Hungarian novelist whose Embers became an international bestseller--a sensuous, suspenseful, aphoristic novel about the world's most notorious seducer and the encounter that changes him forever. In 1756 Giacomo Casanova escapes from a Venetian prison and resurfaces in the Italian village of Bolzano. Here he receives an unwelcome visitor: the aging but still fearsome Duke of Parma, who years before had defeated Casanova in a duel over a ravishing girl named Francesca and spared his life on condition that he never see her again. Now the duke has taken Francesca as his wife--and intercepted a love letter from her to his old rival. Rather than kill Casanova on the spot, he makes him a startling offer, one that is logical, perverse, and irresistible. Turning an historical episode into a dazzling fictional exploration of the clasp of desire and death, Casanova in Bolzano is further proof that Sándor Márai is one of the most distinctive voices of the twentieth century.",0375712968,9780375712968),Paperback,,294 pages,"

","Between 1892 and the early 1950s, nearly 15 million people streamed through Ellis Island in search of a new life. Here are the stories of those extraordinary immigrants, largely in their own poignant words. Coming primarily from Southern and Eastern Europe, and from widely diverse backgrounds, the émigrés represented in this remarkable volume recount their adventures with dignity, wit, and unflagging honesty. Among the dozens of unforgettable narrators you'll meet are a Greek boy who, forced into the Turkish Army, escaped to the U.S. with the help of the Russian Orthodox Church; a young Polish girl who made the harrowing journey only to have to flee a ""white slaver""; and a Czech woman who fooled doctors into letting her travel despite being eight months pregnant.

","A best-selling volume of Pablo Neruda's poetry in an English-Spanish edition.Pablo Neruda is one of the world's most popular and famous poets, and in The Book of Questions, Neruda refuses to be corralled by the rational mind. Composed of 316 unanswerable questions, these poems integrate the wonder of a child with the experiences of an adult. By turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant, Neruda's questions lead the reader beyond reason into the realms of intuition and pure imagination.This complete translation of Pablo Neruda's El libro de las preguntas (The Book of Questions) features Neruda's original Spanish-language poems alongside William O'Daly's English translations. In his introduction O'Daly, who has translated eight volumes of Pablo Neruda's poetry, writes, ""These poems, more so than any of Neruda's other work, remind us that living in a state of visionary surrender to the elemental questions, free of the quiet desperation of clinging too tightly to answers, may be our greatest act of faith.""When Neruda died in 1973, The Book of Questions was one of eight unpublished poetry manuscripts that lay on his desk. In it, Neruda achieves a deeper vulnerability and vision than in his earlier work-and this unique book is a testament to everything that made Neruda an artist.""Neruda's questions evoke pictures that make sense on a visual level before the reader can grasp them on a literal one. The effect is mildly dazzling [and] O'Daly's translations achieve a tone that is both meditative and spontaneous."" --Publishers WeeklyPablo Neruda, born in southern Chile, led a life charged with poetic and political activity. He was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, the International Peace Prize, and served as Chile's ambassador to several countries, including Burma, France, and Argentina. He died in 1973.II.Tell me, is the rose naked or is that her only dress?Why do trees conceal the splendor of their roots?Who hears the regrets of the thieving automobile?Is there anything in the world sadder than a train standing in the rain?XIV.And what did the rubies say standing before the juice of pomegranates?Why doesn't Thursday talk itself into coming after Friday?Who shouted with gleewhen the color blue was born?Why does the earth grievewhen the violets appear?",1556591608,9781556591600),Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Zvi is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss. A careful study of his life is a revelation of the lengths to which a loving Lord will go to bring one soul safely home.",0915540231,9780915540235),Paperback,,202 pages,"

A classic novel from the bestselling author of Moloka'i and HonoluluBefore Alan Brennert became a bestselling author of historical novels, he wrote this lyrical fantasy in the vein of The Time Traveler’s Wife. Part love story, part deeply affecting character study, it is a literary tour de force chronicling the parallel lives of two men who were once the same man--until, as the poet Robert Frost wrote, “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood/And sorry I could not travel both/And be one traveler...”Thirteen years ago, Richard Cochrane left his small New England town to pursue his dreams of an acting career. But on some other level of reality there is also a Rick Cochrane, who chose instead to set aside his dreams, marry the woman he loved, and raise a family. Today, neither man is happy with the choice he made--but as their lives, once separated by time and chance, now draw closer together, Richard and Rick are offered another a last chance to discover “the road not taken.”Time and Chance displays the same vivid sense of time and place--and the vibrant, memorable characters drawn with compassion, warmth, and humor--that have made the author’s historical novels national bestsellers and reading group favorites.

","From the MacArthur and Whiting Award–winning author of John Henry Days and The Intuitionist comes a new, brisk, comic tour de force about identity,history, and the adhesive bandage industryWhen the citizens of Winthrop needed a new name for their town, they did what anyone would do—they hired a consultant. The protagonist of Apex Hides the Hurt is a nomenclature consultant. If you want just the right name for your new product, whether it be automobile or antidepressant, sneaker or spoon, he’s the man to get the job done. Wardrobe lack pizzazz? Come to the Outfit Outlet. Always the wallflower at social gatherings? Try Loquacia. And of course, whenever you take a fall, reach for Apex, because Apex Hides the Hurt. Apex is his crowning achievement, the multicultural bandage that has revolutionized the adhesive bandage industry. “Flesh-colored” be damned—no matter what your skin tone is—Apex will match it, or your money back.After leaving his job (following a mysterious misfortune), his expertise is called upon by the town of Winthrop. Once there, he meets the town council, who will try to sway his opinion over the coming days. Lucky Aberdeen, the millionaire software pioneer and hometown-boy-made-good, wants the name changed to something that will reflect the town’s capitalist aspirations, attracting new businesses and revitalizing the community. Who could argue with that? Albie Winthrop, beloved son of the town’s aristocracy, thinks Winthrop is a perfectly good name, and can’t imagine what the fuss is about. Regina Goode, the mayor, is a descendent of the black settlers who founded the town, and has her own secret agenda for what the name should be. Our expert must decide the outcome, with all its implications for the town’s future. Which name will he choose? Or perhaps he will devise his own? And what’s with his limp, anyway?Apex Hides the Hurt brilliantly and wryly satirizes our contemporary culture, where memory and history are subsumed by the tides of marketing.",038550795X,9780385507950),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

But lies have a way of breeding Monsters in Springdale, Kansas, and the Monsters have come to play.""Here’s the truth about growing up in a small town: you tell lies to survive.I worked at a grocery store during high school, part time on the evenings and weekends. I saw plenty of strange things there: avocados stuffed in a barrel of fresh popcorn left to rot, a coworker who punched holes in the caps of beer bottles with an awl, pies marked “Verda’s own home-baked” which came frozen on pallets with the Sunday dairy truck. I found a body in the trash bin once, but nobody can prove who put it there. No one can prove it was there.There were too many bodies for a town the size of Springdale. The name of the town is a lie, but the bodies aren’t. All of them. When you find a body lying with the outdated yogurt, wilted lettuce, and cardboard boxes, you make up stories to cope. You can’t process a body in the grocery store trash bin. A trick of the light, you say. The way the shadows fell across certain bits of debris like the coat hanger beast in a little boy’s bedroom. That head of lettuce, there, in the corner, looks like a human hand.Bodies are bodies.Dead is dead.And lies are lies.""About the author: Aaron’s stories have been reprinted in The Best of Every Day Fiction 2009 and 2010, listed as a recommended read by Tangent Online, received honorable mention in the storySouth Million Writers Award and Ellen Datlow’s Best Horror of the Year.",,,Nook,,0 pages,"

","Christine Feehan delivers the most startling novel yet in her “must-read” series (Night Owl Reviews) as an immortal male comes to the end of a long and violent journey—to reach a far more dangerous and inescapable threat…   As brutal as the undead he hunted, executioner Zacarias De La Cruz’s savage journey is over. After a thousand years in a gray world, he has accomplished everything he set out to do. His brothers are safeguarded, and each has a woman who completes him. But with his centuries as a killing machine now left to the past, and without a hunt to define him, Zacarias wonders, for the first time in his life, who he really is.   The answer awaits him in the vengeance of an old enemy, in the consequences of a bloody family legacy and in Marguarita, a woman he once saved—his lifemate, his deliverance, and the greatest risk yet to both their lives.

","Stanley Kunitz's collected poems are an unassailable argument for age, experience, and impassioned observation. At 95, America's 10th poet laureate has many decades' worth of work under his belt, and his lyrics form a fine self-portrait even as they track his evolution toward the spare and simple. Kunitz's later poetry seems to effortlessly fuse feeling and form. With considerable wit, he sees into the life of things: a brook or a bird, a squirrel or a salmon is very much a part of nature, but it is also infinitely more, as anyone lucky enough to have read ""King of the River,"" ""The Snakes of September,"" and ""The Wellfleet Whale"" knows.  Kunitz's ""Reflections,"" which preface his Collected Poems, offer several modest credos. In one, he writes, ""I like to think that it is the poet's love of particulars, the things of this world, that leads him to universals."" And his work is ample proof that what Kunitz likes to think is right! In ""Robin Redbreast,"" for instance, the poet--living in an empty house that will soon be his no longer and facing nothing but blank pages--rescues a bird from some belligerent jays:  It was the dingiest bird you ever saw, all the color washed from him, as if he had been standing in the rain, friendless and stiff and cold, since Eden went wrong.  Alas, a moment's complacency at his own good deed comes to a quick end. There is no need for the poet to drive home his point--he merely provides the tragic image of an old bullet hole in the robin's head, through which he catches a glimpse of ""the cold flash of the blue / unappeasable sky."" Yet Kunitz did not arrive at this level without effort, and much of the pleasure of this volume lies in witnessing the growth of the poet's mind. In his first collection, Intellectual Things (1930), the young artist seems to have spent a good deal of time luxuriating in the early Yeats, displaying a sweet tooth for allegory and archaic inversion. Perhaps thinking himself ""a fierce young crier / Of poems,"" the youthful Kunitz pursued the sublime a little too relentlessly. His second book, Passport to the War (1944), is radically different, full of darkness and repudiation, its realities and anger very close to the surface. But it really isn't until The Testing-Tree, where family comes to the fore and influence is no longer cause for anxiety, that the poet finds his voice--one that has yet to desert him.  Several of Kunitz's finest, and most desolate, poems explore his father's suicide, which took place before he was born. Others, on Mark Rothko and Alexander Calder, celebrate creation in the face of immense difficulty. And there are poems, too, of resistance: this generous collection includes translations of Mandelstam, Akhmatova, and Blok, as well as his own ""Around Pastor Bonhoeffer,"" which commemorates the pacifist cleric who was part of the plot to kill Hitler. Throughout there are also love songs--to nature and women. ""Route Six"" makes one wonder why there isn't an official term for a poem celebrating an enduring marriage--an epithalamium with, as they say, legs. After a quarrel, Kunitz suggests to his wife that they head for the Cape, taking with them those passions ""that flare past understanding"":  we can stow them in the rear along with ziggurats of luggage and Celia, our transcendental cat, past-mistress of all languages, including Hottentot and silence.  In ""The Layers,"" the poet asks point-blank: ""How shall the heart be reconciled / to its feast of losses?"" Reconciliation, Kunitz knows, isn't possible, but his work proves that the raptures of love and art are a strong consolation. --Kerry Fried",0393050300,9780393050301),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

He made her fall in love with art when she was nine years old and yet Emily was the muse of Edouard's greatest artwork 150 years before she was born. Their story begins with a letter. While x-raying a painting for an upcoming Edouard Manet exhibition at the Art Institute, Emily stumbles upon a hidden letter painted in lead white beneath the layers of oil and varnish. Through the mysterious properties of the letter, Emily is raptured to the past where she becomes the muse who influences Manet's greatest works. As their relationship grows between each new letter and she discovers that his confusing iconography can finally be explained through their story, an underlying plot of murder and art forgery is uncovered in the present. With the exhibition gala approaching, a connection between the murderer and the forgeries reveals itself and Emily is forced to ask how their love can withstand the test of time when only a few letters remain.",,,Paperback,,590 pages,"

","The crimes of Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Dennis Rader, and other high-profile killers are so breathtakingly awful that most people would not hesitate to label them ""evil."" In this groundbreaking book, renowned psychiatrist Michael H. Stone—host of Discovery Channel’s former series Most Evil—uses this common emotional reaction to horrifying acts as his starting point to explore the concept and reality of evil from a new perspective. In an in-depth discussion of the personality traits and behavior that constitute evil across a wide spectrum, Dr. Stone takes a clarifying scientific approach to a topic that for centuries has been inadequately explained by religious doctrines.Basing his analysis on the detailed biographies of more than 600 violent criminals, Stone has created a 22-level hierarchy of evil behavior, which loosely reflects the structure of Dante’s Inferno. He traces two salient personality traits that run the gamut from those who commit crimes of passion to perpetrators of the worst crimes—sadistic torture and murder. One trait is narcissism, as exhibited in people who are so self-centered that they have little or no ability to care about their victims. The other is aggression, the use of power over another person to inflict humiliation, suffering, and death.Stone then turns to the various factors that, singly or intertwined, contribute to pushing certain people over the edge into committing heinous crimes. They include heredity, adverse environments, violence-prone cultures, mental illness or brain injury, and abuse of mind-altering drugs. All are considered in the search for the root causes of evil behavior.What do psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience tell us about the minds of those whose actions could be described as evil? And what will that mean for the rest of us? Stone discusses how an increased understanding of the causes of evil will affect the justice system. He predicts a day when certain persons can safely be declared salvageable and restored to society and when early signs of violence in children may be corrected before potentially dangerous patterns become entrenched.",1591027268,9781591027263),Hardcover,,430 pages,"

Rowan Broom is plying her trade as fortune-teller in her corner of the Goth club when she discovers that the darkly handsome guy watching her from the bar possesses a literal heart of darkness. If that wasn't trouble enough, Rowan learns through her tarot that the entire club is in grave danger. Evil, in the form of a demonically possessed sorcerer has walked into the club and targeted the vampire as his victim of choice. The sorcerer intends to drain the vampire -- and use that power to kill everyone in the bar. Suddenly Rowan is embroiled in the bizarre task of rescuing a vampire. However, Rowan is not merely a fortune-teller. She is an experienced and potent witch whose source of power is sex - in its rawest and basest form. With the Goth bar in flames behind them, Witch meets Vampire face to face to discover that they have absolutely nothing in common - but unearthly desire. And this is only the Beginning...",1554101557,9781554101559),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","The Kingdom of Frewyn is being invaded by the Galleisian infantry and at the forefront of the battle is Boudicca MacDaede, a First Captain in the Frewyn armed forces. Her regiment is charged with defending the borders between the two nations, but when Frewyn’s last line of defense falls, Captain MacDaede enlists the assistance of a Haanta, one of giants from the islands to the far north. Promising to free him from his imprisonment in exchange for his help, she gains his trust long enough for them to win the battle and save the Frewyn border from being breached. The giant’s freedom is granted, but Rautu cannot return home unless he redeems himself in the eyes of his people for his past transgressions. He is offered a place by the captain’s side, and together, they defeat the Galleisian forces and become the saviors of Frewyn.One year later, King Alasdair Brennin takes the Frewyn throne, Boudicca is made commander, Gallei and Frewyn reach an accord, and Rautu is granted an invitation home. He is eager to return and see his brothers but finds it difficult to leave Frewyn without Boudicca at his side. He has become accustomed to her company and the idea of being made to live without her begins to distress him. Rautu invites the commander to the islands in hopes of finding a way for them to remain together, but when they arrive at the white shores of Sanhedhran, not everything goes as planned: one of the dangerous Haanta magi is freed, Rautu’s three brothers are strangely missing, and the neighboring nation of Thellis leads an attack on the islands.Together, the commander and the Den Asaan Rautu must find a way to unite their two nations and defend against the Thellisian fleets, but can they do so successfully when outside forces are attempting to keep them apart?",1450265790,9781450265799),Paperback,,185 pages,"

",""". . . full of intellectual treats and tricks, of whimsy and deep scientific philosophy. It is highbrow entertainment at its best, a teasing challenge to all who aspire to think about the universe."" — New York Herald TribuneOne of the world's foremost nuclear physicists (celebrated for his theory of radioactive decay, among other accomplishments), George Gamow possessed the unique ability of making the world of science accessible to the general reader.He brings that ability to bear in this delightful expedition through the problems, pleasures, and puzzles of modern science. Among the topics scrutinized with the author's celebrated good humor and pedagogical prowess are the macrocosm and the microcosm, theory of numbers, relativity of space and time, entropy, genes, atomic structure, nuclear fission, and the origin of the solar system.In the pages of this book readers grapple with such crucial matters as whether it is possible to bend space, why a rocket shrinks, the ""end of the world problem,"" excursions into the fourth dimension, and a host of other tantalizing topics for the scientifically curious. Brimming with amusing anecdotes and provocative problems, One Two Three . . . Infinity also includes over 120 delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by the author, adding another dimension of good-natured charm to these wide-ranging explorations.Whatever your level of scientific expertise, chances are you'll derive a great deal of pleasure, stimulation, and information from this unusual and imaginative book. It belongs in the library of anyone curious about the wonders of the scientific universe. ""In One Two Three . . . Infinity, as in his other books, George Gamow succeeds where others fail because of his remarkable ability to combine technical accuracy, choice of material, dignity of expression, and readability."" — Saturday Review of Literature",0486256642,9780486256641),Paperback,,384 pages,"

Against all odds they made their dreams come true, building one of the world's largest trading companies and most luxurious hotels... They had only each other--and bloody secrets to bury even as they rose to dizzying heights, wary of love yet vulnerable to passion in its most dangerous forms... The Mandarin would pass his multi-billion-dollar empire only to the women in the Lai Tsin dynasty--along with one last devastating truth....Sweeping from the turn of the century through the 1960's, from the Orient to San Francisco and New York, Elizabeth Adler has written a magnificent novel of new wealth and old privilege, family passions and secret shame, of women surviving, triumphant, in the riveting saga of romantic intrigue.",0440211468,9780440211464),Paperback,,577 pages,"

","Two full novels collected in one edition formatted for the Kindle. WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM [1874-1965] was a British writer of novels, plays, and short stories. He was a medical student at King's College London. While a student learning midwifery in the London slum of Lambeth, He wrote Liza of Lambeth (1897). The novel was a hit, selling out its first edition in a few weeks. This success convinced Maugham to write full time. By 1914, he produced ten novels and ten plays. In World War I, he was one of the ""Literary Ambulance Drivers"" including Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos and E. E. Cummings. While serving near Dunkirk, he proof-read Of Human Bondage (1915). Theodore Dreiser considered Of Human Bondage ""a work of genius."" In 1916, in the Pacific, he researched Paul Gauguin's life for his novel The Moon And Sixpence (1919). In 1928, he moved to the French Riviera, where he resided for the rest of his life. In 1947, he established the Somerset Maugham Award for British writers. V. S. Naipaul, Kingsley Amis, Martin Amis, and Thom Gunn are some notable recipients of the award.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Orson Scott Card's The Lost Gate is the first book in the Mithermages series from the New York Times bestselling author of Ender's Game.Danny North knew from early childhood that his family was different, and that he was different from them. While his cousins were learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family, Danny worried that he would never show a talent, never form an outself.He grew up in the rambling old house, filled with dozens of cousins, and aunts and uncles, all ruled by his father. Their home was isolated in the mountains of western Virginia, far from town, far from schools, far from other people.There are many secrets in the House, and many rules that Danny must follow. There is a secret library with only a few dozen books, and none of them in English -- but Danny and his cousins are expected to become fluent in the language of the books. While Danny's cousins are free to create magic whenever they like, they must never do it where outsiders might see.Unfortunately, there are some secrets kept from Danny as well. And that will lead to disaster for the North family.The Mithermages seriesThe Lost GateThe Gate ThiefGatefather",0765365383,9780765365385),Mass Market Paperback,,453 pages,"

","In August 1914 the two greatest navies in the world confronted each other across the North Sea. At first there were skirmishes, then battles off the coasts of England and Germany and in the far corners of the world, including the Falklands. The British attempted to force the Dardanelles with battleships - which led to the Gallipoli catastrophe. As the stalemate on the ground on the Western Front continued, the German Navy released a last strike against the British 'ring of steel'. The result was Jutland, a titanic and brutal battle between dreadnoughts. The knowledge, understanding and literary power Robert K. Massie brings to this story is unparalleled. There will never again be a war like this in which seagoing monsters hurl shells at each other until one side is destroyed. The story is driven by some of the most dramatically intriguing personalities in history: Churchill and Jacky Fisher, Jellicoe and Beatty. And then there were the powerful Germans - von Pohl, Scheer, Hipper, and the grand old fork-bearded genius Tirpitz. Castles of Steel is a book about leadership and command, bravery and timidity, genius and folly, qualities which are of course displayed magnificently by Robert K. Massie's literary mastery.",1844134113,9781844134113),Paperback,,880 pages,"

","Loop me in, odd one.The words, spoken in the deep of night by a sleeping child, chill the young man watching over her. For this was a favorite phrase of Stormy Llewellyn, his lost love, and Stormy is dead, gone forever from this world. In the haunted halls of the isolated monastery where he had sought peace, Odd Thomas is stalking spirits of an infinitely darker nature.Through two New York Times bestselling novels Odd Thomas has established himself as one of the most beloved and unique fictional heroes of our time. Now, wielding all the power and magic of a master storyteller at the pinnacle of his craft, Dean Koontz follows Odd into a singular new world where he hopes to make a fresh beginning—but where he will meet an adversary as old and inexorable as time itself.St. Bartholomew’s Abbey sits in majestic solitude amid the wild peaks of California’s high Sierra, a haven for children otherwise abandoned, and a sanctuary for those seeking insight. Odd Thomas has come here to learn to live fully again, and among the eccentric monks, their other guests, and the nuns and young students of the attached convent school, he has begun to find his way. The silent spirits of the dead who visited him in his earlier life are mercifully absent, save for the bell-ringing Brother Constantine and Odd’s steady companion, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.But trouble has a way of finding Odd Thomas, and it slinks back onto his path in the form of the sinister bodachs he has met previously, the black shades who herald death and disaster, and who come late one December night to hover above the abbey’s most precious charges. For Odd is about to face an enemy who eclipses any he has yet encountered, as he embarks on a journey of mystery, wonder, and sheer suspense that surpasses all that has come before.",0553804804,9780553804805),Hardcover,,364 pages,"

What neighbors and even her children don’t know, however, is that she is not who she claims to be—the widow of a Russian immigrant of modest means. In actuality she began her life as the Grand Duchess Tatiana, known as Tania to her parents, Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra.And so begins the latest entrancing historical entertainment by Carolly Erickson. At its center is young Tania, who lives a life of incomparable luxury in pre-Revolutionary Russia, from the magnificence of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to the family’s private enclave outside the capital. Tania is one of four daughters, and the birth of her younger brother Alexei is both a blessing and a curse. When he is diagnosed with hemophilia and the key to his survival lies in the mysterious power of the illiterate monk Rasputin, it is merely an omen of much worse things to come. Soon war breaks out and revolution sweeps the family from power and into claustrophobic imprisonment in Siberia. Into Tania’s world comes a young soldier whose life she helps to save and who becomes her partner in daring plans to rescue the imperial family from certain death.",0312367384,9780312367381),Hardcover,,325 pages,"

",""" ""تحت ظلال الزيزفون sous les tilleuls"" هي الرواية التي كتبها الأديب الفرنسي الفونس كار (1808-1890)، وقد أطلع المنفلوطي على تعريبها. فأعجب بها وأعاد صياغتها بأسلوبه الخاص، ونشرها تحت عنوان ""ماجدولين"" أو""تحت ظلال الزيزفون"". والرواية هي باكورة أعمال ألفونس كار الأدبية كتبها متأثر بالمدرسة الرومانسية التي سيطرت على الأدب في تلك الحقبة من تاريخ فرنسا، وقد اعتمد على أسلوب المراسلة في تدوين أحداثها تاركاً لعنصر الخيال دوراً أساسياً في تحريك أشخاص الرواية بين أحضان الطبيعة الخارجية التي أحبها الكاتب وجعلها الإطار الأساسي لروايته. لقد تأثر المنفلوطي برواية ألفونس كار، وبادر إلى نقلها إلى اللغة العربية، لما فيها من دعوة صريحة إلى التماسك بقيم الحق والخير والجمال التي تجسدها البيئة القروية الريفية الساذجة. فأحداث القصة تدور في جوّ ريفي، يتميز بالبساطة والعفوية والصدق والإخلاص والقناعة، شبيه بالجو الذي نشأ فيه المنفلوطي بمصر، على خلاف حياة المدينة القائمة على الخداع والكذب والغش، والنفاق، حيث يتهافت الناس على جمع المال دون مراعاة أبسط المبادئ والقيم الخلقية. والرواية تحاول التأكيد على أن الخلاف الحاد بين أحدهما يعتبر أن السعادة هي نتيجة نجاح المرء في التلاؤم والتكيف مع الظروف الواقعية التي تحيط به، والمفهوم الآخر يعتبر أن المال هو مفتاح السعادة أياً كانت الوسائل المستخدمة في الحصول عليه.""",,,Paperback,Second Edition,184 pages,"

","""Controversial in both life and art, Francis Bacon was one of the most important painters of the twentieth century. His monumental, unsettling images have an extraordinary power to disturb, shock, and haunt the spectator, ""to unlock the valves of feeling and therefore return the onlooker to life more violently"".Eminent writer and curator David Sylvester provides the definitive account of the career of an artist whose friend and collaborator he was for more than forty years. Drawing on his unparalleled personal knowledge of Bacon's inspirations and intentions, he first offers a critical overview of the development of Bacon's work from 1933 to the early 1990s, and then addresses its crucial aspects. Sylvester also reproduces previously unpublished extracts from his celebrated conversations with Bacon in which the artist speaks about himself, modern painters, and the art of the past. Finally, he gives a brief account of Bacon's life, correcting errors that elsewhere have been presented as facts.Accompanying the incisive and revealing text are reproductions of almost every Bacon work discussed, including twelve triptych fold-outs. The most complete work on Bacon yet, this book constitutes a portrait of one of the creative geniuses of our age by a writer of comparable distinction.",0500274754,9780500274750),Paperback,Third Enlarged Edition,208 pages,"

","Life changes in an instant. On a foggy beach. In the seconds when Abby Mason—photographer, fiancée soon-to-be-stepmother—looks into her camera and commits her greatest error. Heartbreaking, uplifting, and beautifully told, here is the riveting tale of a family torn apart, of the search for the truth behind a child’s disappearance, and of one woman’s unwavering faith in the redemptive power of love—all made startlingly fresh through Michelle Richmond’s incandescent sensitivity and extraordinary insight.Six-year-old Emma vanished into the thick San Francisco fog. Or into the heaving Pacific. Or somewhere just beyond: to a parking lot, a stranger’s van, or a road with traffic flashing by. Devastated by guilt, haunted by her fears about becoming a stepmother, Abby refuses to believe that Emma is dead. And so she searches for clues about what happened that morning—and cannot stop the flood of memories reaching from her own childhood to illuminate that irreversible moment on the beach.Now, as the days drag into weeks, as the police lose interest and fliers fade on telephone poles, Emma’s father finds solace in religion and scientific probability—but Abby can only wander the beaches and city streets, attempting to recover the past and the little girl she lost. With her life at a crossroads, she will leave San Francisco for a country thousands of miles away. And there, by the side of another sea, on a journey that has led her to another man and into a strange subculture of wanderers and surfers, Abby will make the most astounding discovery of all—as the truth of Emma’s disappearance unravels with stunning force.A profoundly original novel of family, loss, and hope—of the choices we make and the choices made for us—The Year of Fog beguiles with the mysteries of time and memory even as it lays bare the deep and wondrous workings of the human heart. The result is a mesmerizing tour de force that will touch anyone who knows what it means to love a child.",0385340117,9780385340113),Hardcover,,369 pages,"

Meanwhile, their friend Bill Cantwell heads to Manhattan in search of his missing niece, a fledgling musician with lots of attitude. Back in Boston, Jack's sister, Courtney, is left to hold the fort.

","The last decades of the nineteenth century were a violent period in China’s history marked by humiliating foreign incursions and domestic rebellion, ultimately ending in the demise of the Ch’ing dynasty. The only constant during this tumultuous time was the power wielded by one person, the resilient, ever-resourceful Tzu Hsi, Lady Yehonala -- or Empress Orchid, as readers came to know her in Anchee Min’s critically acclaimed novel covering the first part of her life.The Last Empress is the story of Orchid’s dramatic transition from a strong-willed, instinctive young woman to a wise and politically savvy leader who ruled China for more than four decades. Moving from the intimacy of the concubine quarters into the spotlight of the world stage, Orchid must face not only the perilous condition of her empire but also a series of devastating personal losses, as first her son and then her adopted son succumb to early death. Yearning only to step aside, and yet growing constantly into her role, only she—allied with the progressives, but loyal to the conservative Manchu clan of her dynasty—can hold the nation’s rival factions together.Anchee Min offers a powerful revisionist portrait based on extensive research of one of the most important figures in Chinese history. Viciously maligned by the western press of the time as the “Dragon Lady,” a manipulative, blood-thirsty woman who held onto power at all costs, the woman Min gives us is a compelling, very human leader who assumed power reluctantly, and who sacrificed all she had to protect those she loved and an empire that was doomed to die.",0618531467,9780618531462),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

","A leading German metaphysician of the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) exerted an influence far beyond the hermetic world of philosophy, with adherents ranging from Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Mann. Among Schopenhauer's chief contributions to the field of philosophy are his rejection of the idealism of his contemporaries and his embrace of a practical variety of materialism. He jettisons the traditional philosophic jargon for a brisk, compelling style that employs direct terms to express the metaphysics of the will.In The Wisdom of Life, an essay from Schopenhauer's final work, Parerga und Paralipomena (1851), the philosopher favors individual strength of will and independent, reasoned deliberation over the tendency to act on irrational impulses. He examines the ways in which life can be arranged to derive the highest degree of pleasure and success, presents guidelines to achieving this full and rich manner of living, and advises that even a life well lived must always aspire to grander heights. Abounding in subjects of enduring relevance, Schopenhauer's highly readable work appears here in an excellent translation.",0486435504,9780486435503),Paperback,,96 pages,"

","Morangos mofados é uma das mais importantes obras de Caio Fernando Abreu. Com este livro, o autor tornou-se um sucesso editorial na década de 1980 ao expor o que há de mais profundo no ser humano.A série de contos que se entrelaçam como se fossem um romance trata de dor, fracasso, encontros, amores e esperança. Os textos abordam os anseios da geração dos anos 70 e a falta de perspectiva de concretizá-los. Apesar da passagem temporal, tais questionamentos podem ser considerados parte da realidade dos dias de hoje e conseguem envolver os leitores.O autor, homossexual assumido, é apontado como um dos expoentes de sua geração. Ele faleceu em 1996 e deixou como marca registrada seu estilo econômico e bem pessoal em obras permeadas por temas totalmente humanos, como o sexo, o medo, a morte e a solidão.",8522006466,9788522006465),Paperback,,160 pages,"

","Buddhism is all about training the mind, and boot camp is an ideal training method for this generation's short attention span. The chapters in this small book can be read in any order, and are short and easy to understand. Each story, inspirational quote and teaching offers mindfulness-enhancing techniques that anyone can relate to. It is very possible (and perfectly okay) for people who are Catholic, Muslim or Jewish, for example, to still find the Buddha's teachings motivational. As the Dalai Lama says, ""Don't try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are."" There is absolutely no reason to argue over which religion came ""first"" or whose philosophy is ""better"". The important thing is to be kind, understanding, peaceful, patient and compassionate, which is actually fundamental in all religions. Whether it's Mother Teresa's acts of charity, Gandhi's perseverance, or your aunt Betty's calm demeanor, it doesn't matter who inspires you, so long as you're motivated to be better today than you were yesterday. Regardless of religion or geographical region, race, ethnicity, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, flexibility or vulnerability, if you do good, you feel good, and if you do bad, you feel bad. Amen! Hallelujah! And all that Jazz! If you agree that Buddhism isn't just about meditating, but also about rolling up your sleeves to actually relieve some of the suffering in the world, then become a fan on Facebook (and a follower on Twitter) to meet other like-minded-folks for beach cleanup events, feeding the homeless, caring for the elderly, community yoga, cooking classes, tutoring, or anything we can each do to help others. You're now a soldier of peace in the army of love; welcome to Buddhist Boot Camp!",0985836903,9780985836900),Paperback,,73 pages,"

","When Roman politician Caelius inherits a stable of gladiators, there is one who captures his attention above the others...one whose eyes gleam with hate, pride and desire.Forced into slavery by Roman greed, Gaidres can barely conceal his contempt toward his new Dominus. Gaidres has a plan: kill Caelius and end the lineage of the Roman family that enslaved him. For his plan to succeed, he must make a show of respect and obedience--even when called on to service his master's desires.Gaidres is shocked to learn that in the confines of his quarters, Caelius doesn't want to dominate his slave, but to be taken by him. The sex is explosive as they break society's taboos and, to Gaidres's dismay, they form a tenuous relationship. Even when Caelius learns of Gaidres's plans for revenge, he knows he can't live without his perfect lover. Is he willing to risk it all to tame his gladiator's heart?88,000 words",,,Kindle Edition,,244 pages,"

","With her signature blend of sensual fantasy, thrilling adventure, and breathtaking magic, Karen Marie Moning—the #1 New York Times bestselling author of such novels as Shadowfever and Dreamfever—is the reigning queen of paranormal romance. Now in a convenient eBook bundle, here are the seven novels in her spellbinding Highlander series, featuring passionate love stories with a time-travel twist: Beyond the Highland Mist, To Tame a Highland Warrior, The Highlander’s Touch, Kiss of the Highlander, The Dark Highlander, The Immortal Highlander, and Spell of the Highlander.  “Highly original . . . sensual, hard-to-put-down romance. Karen Marie Moning is destined to make her mark on the genre.”—Romantic Times, on Beyond the Highland Mist  Beyond the Highland Mist  He is known throughout medieval Scotland as Hawk. No woman could refuse his touch, but no woman ever stirred his heart—until Adrienne de Simone tumbles out of modern-day Seattle and into Hawk’s legendary bed.  To Tame a Highland Warrior  He was born to a clan of Highland warriors of supernatural strength, but Gavrael McIllioch abandoned his name to escape the dark fate of his ancestors. Yet even from afar, he watches over Jillian St. Clair. She is the only woman who can tame the beast within him—even as deadly enemies plot to destroy them both.  The Highlander’s Touch  A trick of fate has sent Lisa seven hundred years back in time and into Scottish warrior Circenn Brodie’s chamber to tempt him with an all-consuming desire. For this woman he burns to possess is also the woman he has foresworn to destroy.   Kiss of the Highlander  Enchanted by a powerful spell, Highland laird Drustan MacKeltar has slumbered for nearly five centuries, until an unlikely savior, Gwen Cassidy, awakens him. Bound to Drustan, Gwen is swept back to sixteenth-century Scotland where a warrior with the power to change history will defy time itself for the woman he loves.  The Dark Highlander  Dageus MacKeltar is a sixteenth-century Scot trapped between worlds, battling with the thirteen Druids who possess his soul. When Chloe Zanders is drawn into his world, she will face the challenge of a lifetime: fighting thirteen evil spirits for the heart of one irresistible man.  The Immortal Highlander  Adam Black is free to roam across time in pursuit of his insatiable desires, until a curse strips him of his immortality and makes him invisible. The only woman who can see him is Gabrielle O’Callaghan. It is the beginning of a long, dangerous seduction, the price of which could be their very lives.  Spell of the Highlander  Jessi St. James first sees the gorgeous man staring out at her from the glass of an ancient mirror. Heir to the arcane magic of his Druid ancestors, Cian MacKeltar was trapped centuries ago inside the Dark Glass, and now an enemy will stop at nothing to reclaim it. And Cian will stop at nothing to protect Jessi from a deadly fate.  “[Moning’s] storytelling skills are impressive, her voice and pacing dynamic, and her plot as tight as a cask of good Scotch whisky.”—Contra Costa Times, on Kiss of the Highlander Includes a tantalizing excerpt from Karen Marie Moning’s beloved novella Into the Dreaming.",0345538269,9780345538260),ebook,,2816 pages,"

","Love that lasts forever is the kind worth waiting for. Taylor Moore is an artist. With the bold colors of her palette, she gives life to her passionate memories of Jake Farrell. It's been ten long years since the dark-haired, green-eyed football player left town. In that decade, Taylor has been married to and divorced from the bitter man who always stood between them. After all this time, she still aches with hunger for that ruggedly beautiful boy from her past, unable to love another. But when Jake suddenly comes home, all grown up and claiming to have returned for her, Taylor's not buying it. She's more than ready to trust the gorgeous man with her body, allowing his dominant sexuality full control; she just refuses to trust him with her heart. But Jake's been waiting a lifetime for this woman, and he's not about to accept half-measures. He wants her full surrender, and Taylor must finally find the courage to stop waiting for it and start living for love.",1419950045,9781419950049),Paperback,,215 pages,"

","What exactly ""warps"" when you are traveling at warp speed? What is the difference between the holodeck and a hologram? What happens when you get beamed up? Are time loops really possible, and can I kill my grandmother before I was born? Until now, fans of ""Star Trek"" were hard pressed to find answers to vital questions such as these. Now Lawrence M. Krauss, an internationally known theoretical physicist and educator, has written the quintessential physics book for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.Anyone who has ever wondered, ""Could this really happen?"" will gain useful insights into the ""Star Trek"" universe (and, incidentally, the real universe) in this charming and accessible volume. Krauss boldly goes where ""Star Trek"" has gone -- and beyond. He uses the ""Star Trek"" future as a launching pad to discuss the forefront of modern physics. From Newton to Hawking, from Einstein to Feynman, from Kirk to Janeway, Krauss leads the reader on a voyage to the world of physics as we now know it and as it might one day be.Featuring the Top 10 biggest physics bloopers in ""Star Trek,"" as selected by Nobel Prize-winning physicists and other dedicated Trekkers!""This book is fun, and Mr. Krauss has a nice touch with a tough subject...Readers drawn by frivolity will be treated to substance.""

In this new work, pastor Thabiti Anyabwile attempts to answer the natural next question: ""What does a healthy church member look like in the light of Scripture?""God intends for us to play an active and vital part in the body of Christ, the local church. He wants us to experience the local church as a home more profoundly wonderful and meaningful than any other place on earth. He intends for his churches to be healthy places and for the members of those churches to be healthy as well.

","A routine interview between a reporter and an elderly baker brings out memories of darker times: her life in Germany during that last bleak year of WWII. As their lives become more intertwined, all are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.In 1945, Elsie Schmidt is a naive teenager, as eager for her first sip of champagne as she is for her first kiss. She and her family have been protected from the worst of the terror and desperation overtaking her country by a high-ranking Nazi who wishes to marry her. So when an escaped Jewish boy arrives on Elsie's doorstep in the dead of night on Christmas Eve, Elsie understands that opening the door would put all she loves in danger. Sixty years later, in El Paso, Texas, Reba Adams is trying to file a feel-good Christmas piece for the local magazine. Reba is perpetually on the run from memories of a turbulent childhood, but she's been in El Paso long enough to get a full-time job and a fiancé, Riki Chavez. Riki, an agent with the U.S. Border Patrol, finds comfort in strict rules and regulations, whereas Reba feels that lines are often blurred. Reba's latest assignment has brought her to the shop of an elderly baker across town. The interview should take a few hours at most, but the owner of Elsie's German Bakery is no easy subject. Reba finds herself returning to the bakery again and again, anxious to find the heart of the story. For Elsie, Reba's questions are a stinging reminder of darker times: her life in Germany during that last bleak year of WWII. And as Elsie, Reba, and Riki's lives become more intertwined, all are forced to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past and seek out the courage to forgive.",0307460207,9780307460202),Hardcover,First Edition,279 pages,"

But when Kate returns to Jacob's ranch for his sister's wedding, he sees Kate with new eyes. She is older and living in the city; surely she has become much more worldly. The time for restraint is over.Kate is naive about a lot of things, but she knows what Jacob is offering, and it isn't forever. And yet she's been in love with him for as long as she can remember. If a couple of nights in his arms are all she'll ever have of him, aren't a few precious memories better than none at all? Even if that surrender breaks her heart....(185 pages)Bonus book included in this volume!The Rough and Ready Rancher by USA TODAY bestselling author Kathie DeNoskyRancher Flint McCray needed a stallion tamer, not some curvy cowgirl infiltrating his domain.

","In an extraordinary debut novel, an escaped fugitive upends everything two siblings think they know about their family, their past, and themselves.When eleven-year-old Annie first started lying to her social worker, she had been taught by an expert: Gran. ""If you’re going to do something, make sure you do it with excellence,"" Gran would say. That was when Gran was feeling talkative, and not brooding for days in her room — like she did after telling Annie and her little brother, Rew, the one thing they know about their father: that he was killed in a fight with an angry man who was sent away. Annie tells stories, too, as she and Rew laze under the birches and oaks of Zebra Forest — stories about their father the pirate, or pilot, or secret agent. But then something shocking happens to unravel all their stories: a rattling at the back door, an escapee from the prison holding them hostage in their own home, four lives that will never be the same. Driven by suspense and psychological intrigue, Zebra Forest deftly portrays an unfolding standoff of truth against family secrets — and offers an affecting look at two resourceful, imaginative kids as they react and adapt to the hand they’ve been dealt.",0763660418,9780763660413),Hardcover,,208 pages,"

","Is there a way to always have a fat bank account, or a better job, or a delightfully smooth relationship, or a better body? And if so, is it really possible to realize these dreams now, rather than at some unknown future time?Lynn Grabhorn answers these questions with a resounding ""Yes!"" In Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, she says that what actually molds every moment of every day of one's life are feelings. Using a candid, witty approach to a genre riddled with self-important puffery, she shows how feelings - not positive thinking, or sweat and strain, or good or bad luck, or even smarts - set the tone for people's lives. She frames her theory as a four-part plan that covers all the big topics - money, relationships, health, and spirituality - without being pompous or preachy.A ""must read"" for anyone stuck in negativity.Softcover, Published February, 2000.",1571743812,9781571743817),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Living Deeply transcends any one approach by focusing on common elements of transformation across a variety of traditions, while affirming and supporting the diversity of approaches across religious, spiritual, scientific, academic, and cultural backgrounds. Each chapter in the book ends with Experiences of Transformation, exercises drawn from wisdom traditions or scientific investigations meant to enhance your direct experience of the material.Opportunities to actively engage in your own transformation and that of our world are woven into the fabric of your everyday life. Learning more about the terrain of consciousness transformation can not only give you a map, but can help you become the cartographer of your own transformative journey. Research over the last decade at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) has systematically surveyed hundreds of people's stories of their own transformations, as well as conducting over 50 in-depth interviews with teachers and masters of the world's spiritual, religious, and transformative traditions.No matter who you are,where you come from, or what your current path is - whether you seek to transform your life completely or simply make adjustments that will add a layer of richness and depth to your life - exploring the many ways that transformation is stimulated and sustained can hold great power. Weaving together cutting-edge science with wisdom from teachers of the world's transformative traditions this book explores how people experience deep shifts in their consciousness, and how those shifts can lead to healing and wholeness.Research over the last decade at the Institute of Noetic Sciences has explored in depth the phenomenon by which people make significant shifts in the way they experience and view the world. Focusing in particular on positive transformations in consciousness, or those that result in improved health, well-being, and sense of meaning, purpose,and belonging, hundreds of people's stories of their own transformations were included in the research, as well as in-depth interviews with over 50 teachers and masters of the world's spiritual, religious, and transformative traditions.Authors Marilyn Mandala Schlitz, Ph.D., Cassandra Vieten, Ph.D., and Tina Amorok, Psy.D. - will begin conducting workshops based on the information they have gathered for this book. These workshops will blend the rigors of science with the deep wisdom of the world’s spiritual traditions. Drs. Schlitz, Vieten, and Amorok will offer key insights from the decade-long qualitative and quantitative research study, of how people transform their lives. The workshops will include rigorous inquiry, group dialogue, and direct experience about the kinds of transformations in consciousness that change a person’s worldview to one that is more connected to others.For more information about the Signature Education Workshops, please visit www.livingdeeply.orgAlso available is a companion DVD.",1572245336,9781572245334),Paperback,,231 pages,"

","Juana of Castile, the last queen of Spanish blood to inherit her country's throne, has been for centuries an enigmatic figure shrouded in lurid myth. Was she the bereft widow of legend who was driven mad by her loss, or has history misjudged a woman who was ahead of her time? In his stunning new novel, C. W. Gortner challenges the myths about Queen Juana, unraveling the mystery surrounding her to reveal a brave, determined woman we can only now begin to fully understand.The third child of Queen Isabel and King Ferdinand of Spain, Juana is born amid her parentsâ€™ ruthless struggle to unify their kingdom, bearing witness to the fall of Granada and Columbusâ€™s discoveries. At the age of sixteen, she is sent to wed Philip, the archduke of Flanders, as part of her parentsâ€™ strategy to strengthen Spain, just as her youngest sister, Catherine of Aragon, is sent to England to become the first wife of Henry VIII. Juana finds unexpected love and passion with her handsome young husband, the sole heir to the Habsburg Empire. At first she is content with her children and her life in Flanders. But when tragedy strikes and she inherits the Spanish throne, Juana finds herself plunged into a battle for power against her husband that grows to involve the major monarchs of Europe. Besieged by foes on all sides, her intelligence and pride used as weapons against her, Juana vows to secure her crown and save Spain from ruin, even if it could cost her everything.With brilliant, lyrical prose, novelist and historian C. W. Gortner conjures Juana through her own words, taking the reader from the somber majesty of Spain to the glittering and lethal courts of Flanders, France, and Tudor England. The Last Queen brings to life all the grandeur and drama of an incomparable era, and the singular humanity of this courageous, passionate princess whose fight to claim her birthright captivated the world.",0345501845,9780345501844),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

But when the girls are mysteriously transported by The Spirit to a dangerously different world populated by mediaeval Men, noble Elves, magnificent Dragons, and savage creatures, Ameca s whole perspective has to change and change quickly if they are to escape the clutches of an evil entity known as the Scelestus, who wants them for the magical powers they did not even know they possessed.

Mandeville wrote a book about his voyage around the world that became a beacon that lit the way for the great expeditions of the Renaissance, and his exploits and adventures provided inspiration for writers such as Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats. By the nineteenth century however, his claims were largely discredited by academics. Giles Milton set off in the footsteps of Mandeville, in order to test his amazing claims, and to restore Mandeville to his rightful place in the literature of exploration.",031242129X,9780312421298),Paperback,,230 pages,"

Certainly, there are few sacred cows quite as sacred as the right of modern Christians to dress however they please. But in this groundbreaking work, Jeff Pollard challenges us to embrace God's standard and to understand the historical roots of the rise of nudity and immodesty in modern culture. His perspective is thoughtful and balanced. Most importantly, he accomplishes what few authors on this subject have achieved: a treatise that avoids both license and legalism.

","“Luminous... a beautiful book.” – Carolyn See   For Vietnam veteran Jesse Pasadoble, now a defense attorney living in San Francisco, the battle still rages: in his memories, in the gang wars erupting on Potrero Hill, and in the recent slaying of two women: one black, one Vietnamese. While seeking justice for the young man accused of this brutal double murder, Jesse must walk with the ghosts of men who died on another hill... men who were his comrades and friends in a war that crossed racial divides.  Gods Go Begging is a new classic of Latino literature, a literary detective novel that moves seamlessly between the jungles of Vietnam and the streets of modern day San Francisco. Described as “John Steinbeck crossed with Gabriel García Márquez”, Véa weaves a powerful and cathartic story of war and peace, guilt and innocence, suffering and love - and of one man’s climb toward salvation.    ",0452281156,9780452281158),Paperback,,320 pages,"

But Queeg's actions go beyond strictness into psychopathology as he brings the ship and its crew to the brink of destruction. This necessitates a brutal shipboard court-martial that threatens by turns to clear or condemn him. In adapting his novel for the theater, Herman Wouk focused on the heart of the story: the trial and the man at its center. The result is a grimly effective picture of Queeg's disintegration from perfectionist to paranoid that acts as an indictment not only of an individual but of a society that produces such men.",0385514417,9780385514415),Paperback,,120 pages,"

But when Kelly ends up in the emergency room with a suspicious life-threatening medical condition, the incident strikes him as more than just coincidence. Digging deeper, he discovers she's linked to a long-ago crime. Is history repeating itself? And who wants Kelly silenced?

","A revelatory exploration of the Jewish roots of the Last Supper that seeks to understand exactly what happened at Jesus' final Passover. ""Clear, profound and practical--you do not want to miss this book.""--Dr. Scott Hahn, author of The Lamb's Supper and The Fourth CupJesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist shines fresh light on the Last Supper by looking at it through Jewish eyes. Using his in-depth knowledge of the Bible and ancient Judaism, Dr. Brant Pitre answers questions such as: What was the Passover like at the time of Jesus? What were the Jewish hopes for the Messiah? What was Jesus' purpose in instituting the Eucharist during the feast of Passover? And, most important of all, what did Jesus mean when he said, ""This is my body... This is my blood""?To answer these questions, Pitre explores ancient Jewish beliefs about the Passover of the Messiah, the miraculous Manna from heaven, and the mysterious Bread of the Presence. As he shows, these three keys--the Passover, the Manna, and the Bread of the Presence--have the power to unlock the original meaning of the Eucharistic words of Jesus. Along the way, Pitre also explains how Jesus united the Last Supper to his death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday.Inspiring and informative, Jesus and the Jewish Roots of the Eucharist is a groundbreaking work that is sure to illuminate one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith: the mystery of Jesus' presence in ""the breaking of the bread.""",0385531842,9780385531849),Hardcover,,228 pages,"

","Philip Carlo's The Ice Man spent over six weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Top Mob Hitman. Devoted Family Man. Doting Father. For thirty years, Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski led a shocking double life, becoming the most notorious professional assassin in American history while happily hosting neighborhood barbecues in suburban New Jersey.Richard Kuklinski was Sammy the Bull Gravano's partner in the killing of Paul Castellano, then head of the Gambino crime family, at Sparks Steakhouse. Mob boss John Gotti hired him to torture and kill the neighbor who accidentally ran over his child. For an additional price, Kuklinski would make his victims suffer; he conducted this sadistic business with coldhearted intensity and shocking efficiency, never disappointing his customers. By his own estimate, he killed over two hundred men, taking enormous pride in his variety and ferocity of technique.This trail of murder lasted over thirty years and took Kuklinski all over America and to the far corners of the earth, Brazil, Africa, and Europe. Along the way, he married, had three children, and put them through Catholic school. His daughter's medical condition meant regular stays in children's hospitals, where Kuklinski was remembered, not as a gangster, but as an affectionate father, extremely kind to children. Each Christmas found the Kuklinski home festooned in colorful lights; each summer was a succession of block parties.His family never suspected a thing.Richard Kuklinski is now the subject of the major motion picture titled ""The Iceman""(2013), starring James Franco, Winona Ryder, Ray Liotta, and Chris Evans.",0312938845,9780312938840),Paperback,,505 pages,"

","The Fourth Way is the most comprehensive statement thus far published of the ideas taught by the late P.D. Ouspensky. Consisting of verbatim records of his oral teaching from 1921 to 1946, it gives a lucid explanation of the practical side of G. I. Gurdjieff's teachings, which Gurdjieff presented in the form of raw materials, Ouspensky's specific task having been to put them together as a systematic whole. Just as Tertium Organum deals with a new mode of thinking, so The Fourth Way is concerned with a new way of living. It shows a way of inner development to be followed under the ordinary conditions of life -- as distinct from the three traditional ways that call for retirement from the world: those of the fakir, the monk, and the yogi.The Fourth Way is a guide for those who seek a true way of inner growth under conditions open to the men and women of today.",0394716728,9780394716725),Paperback,,480 pages,"

What she doesn’t have is a husband, because she kicked her lousy, cheating ex to the curb nine months ago. Since then, Alli has paid her dues with seemingly endless self-improvement and seemingly endless mourning. Now she’s ready to move on and try new things.  Alli’s idea of “trying new things” is nothing like that devil-of-a-best-friend of hers. Somehow, Sara, the devil of a best friend, talks Alli into trying out a sex toy, sleeping with a younger man and letting a stranger in a lab jacket put hot wax on a place that should never, ever, ever see wax. And that’s only the beginning.  Alli never saw her life going quite like this. She also never thought she’d meet someone else who had the very real potential to change her life forever.  But she did. Enter the new guy. He’s gorgeous, refined and mature. He’s also marriage material. But that poses a problem for Alli, who renounced the institution of marriage when she renounced her ex. What’s a girl to do? They say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But what the heck happens when you can’t leave Vegas? Well, you spin the wheel, of course. You play the game and let the chips fall where they may.  Alli just hopes she can find them all. *******Caution!

","National Bestseller He was the foremost American of his day, yet today he is little more than a mythic caricature in the public imagination. Benjamin Franklin, perhaps the pivotal figure in colonial and revolutionary America, comes vividly to life in this masterly biography.Wit, diplomat, scientist, philosopher, businessman, inventor, and bon vivant, Benjamin Franklin was in every respect America’s first Renaissance man. From penniless runaway to highly successful printer, from ardently loyal subject of Britain to architect of an alliance with France that ensured America’s independence, Franklin went from obscurity to become one of the world’s most admired figures, whose circle included the likes of Voltaire, Hume, Burke, and Kant. Drawing on previously unpublished letters and a host of other sources, acclaimed historian H. W. Brands has written a thoroughly engaging biography of the eighteenth-century genius. A much needed reminder of Franklin’s greatness and humanity, The First American is a work of meticulous scholarship that provides a magnificent tour of a legendary historical figure, a vital era in American life, and the countless arenas in which the protean Franklin left his legacy.",0385495404,9780385495400),Paperback,,765 pages,"

","Investors are all too often lured by the prospect of instant millions and fall prey to the many fads of Wall Street. The myriad approaches they adopt offer little or no real prospect for long-term success and invariably run the risk of considerable economic loss - they resemble speculation or outright gambling, not a coherent investment program. But value investing - the strategy of investing in securities trading at an appreciable discount from underlying value - has a long history - has a long history of delivering excellent investment results with limited downside risk. Taking its title from Benjamin Graham's often-repeated admonition to invest always with a margin of safety, Klarman's 'Margin of Safety' explains the philosophy of value investing, and perhaps more importantly, the logic behind it, demonstrating why it succeeds while other approaches fail. The blueprint that Klarman offers, if carefully followed, offers the investor the strong possibility of investment success with limited risk. 'Margin of Safety' shows you not just how to invest but how to think deeply about investing - to understand the rationale behind the rules to appreciate why they work when they work, and why they don't when they don't.",0887305105,9780887305108),Hardcover,,248 pages,"

","With the publication of the ""Recognitions"" in 1955, William Gaddis was hailed as the American heir to James Joyce. His two subsequent novels, ""J R"" (winner of the National Book Award) and ""Carpenter's Gothic,"" have secured his position among America's foremost contemporary writers. Now ""A Frolic of His Own,"" his long-anticipated fourth novel, adds more luster to his reputation, as he takes on life in our litigious times. ""Justice? - You get justice in the next world, in this world you have the law."" So begins this mercilessly funny, devastatingly accurate tale of lives caught up in the toils of the law. Oscar Crease, middle-aged college instructor, savant, and playwright, is suing a Hollywood producer for pirating his play Once at Antietam, based on his grandfather's experiences in the Civil War, and turning it into a gory blockbuster called The Blood in the Red White and Blue. Oscar's suit, and a host of others - which involve a dog trapped in an outdoor sculpture, wrongful death during a river baptism, a church versus a soft drink company, and even Oscar himself after he is run over by his own car - engulf all who surround him, from his freewheeling girlfriend to his well-to-do stepsister and her ill-fated husband (a partner in the white-shoe firm of Swyne & Dour), to his draconian, nonagenarian father, Federal Judge Thomas Crease, who has just wielded the long arm of the law to expel God (and Satan) from his courtroom. And down the tortuous path of depositions and decrees, suits and countersuits, the most lofty ideas of our culture - questions about the value of art, literature, and originality - will be wrung dry in the meticulous, often surreal logic and language of the law,leaving no party unscathed. Gaddis has created a whirlwind of a novel, which brilliantly reproduces the Tower of Babel in which we conduct our lives. In ""A Frolic of His Own"" we hear voices as they speak at and around one another: lawyers, family members, judges, rogues, hucksters, and desperate",0684800527,9780684800523),Paperback,,512 pages,"

The essay dissects the nature of the communist regime of the time, life within such a regime and how by their very nature such regimes can create dissidents of ordinary citizens. The essay goes on to discuss ideas and possible actions by loose communities of individuals linked by a common cause, such as Charter 77.

","This evocative story of greed, power, and deception sweeps from the underground cave network of the Combers, living like spiders among the endless tunnels and ropes, to the beautiful city inhabited by Abovers. When a young man named Rej discovers the body of a murdered Abover in the combes, their worlds begin to draw closer. He swears vengeance for the murdered man and takes a great risk in going above. There he is placed in the care of Donna, a beautiful young woman trapped in her life as a worker. Food and clothing are rationed, while slaves and workers are forced to live in meager barracks. But Rej and Donna have more in common than a miserable existence; they have weirdly identical dreams of dragons flying in a clear blue sky. They are even more surprised to learn that the city's cruel leader, the Arkel, is determined to find a way to bring just such dreams to life in order to literally scare the population to death. The connection Rej and Donna make leads them on a dramatic adventure to save their loved ones from the Arkel's terrifying plans. N. M. Browne has created an unforgettable world in this richly layered narrative.",158234910X,9781582349107),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A powerful and original argument that traces the roots of our present crisis of authority to an unlikely source: the meritocracy.Over the past decade, Americans watched in bafflement and rage as one institution after another –  from Wall Street to Congress, the Catholic Church to corporate America, even Major League Baseball – imploded under the weight of corruption and incompetence. In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.How did we get here? With Twilight of the Elites, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, Twilight of the Elites describes how the society we have come to inhabit – utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom – produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.Upending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. Twilight of the Elites is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.",0307720454,9780307720450),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","London, 1812. When the controversial, reform-minded Bishop of London is found bludgeoned to death in an ancient crypt beside the corpse of an unidentified man murdered decades before, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, is asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury to help with the investigation. To Sebastian's consternation, the last person to see the Bishop alive was Miss Hero Jarvis, a woman whose already strained relationship with St. Cyr has been complicated by a brief, unexpectedly passionate encounter. As his search for the killer leads him from the back allies of Smithfield to the power corridors of Whitehall, Sebastian amasses a list of suspects that range from some of the Prince Regent's closest cronies to William Franklin, embittered son of famous American patriot Ben Franklin. Sebastian must also confront the well-guarded secrets of his own family's past—and a devastating truth that could ultimately force him to question who—and what—he really is.",0451228022,9780451228024),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","The first woman had her lungs ripped out. When the same gruesome ritualistic method was used again, it was clear that the same killer was responsible. But there is no precise evidence to link the two cases, except for the tantalising email. In his first crime novel, Craig Russell introduces us to a new detective hero, Jan Fabel -half-Scottish, half-German -a man of conscience and imagination. Russell has also created a richly textured scenario where the City of Hamburg plays a central role -it is a city where the old Germany combines increasingly with the new, where gangs from Turkey and the Ukraine battle for supremacy. Blood Eagle is a violently exciting thriller and Fabel's desperate attempt to solve the case before more victims are discovered, gradually uncovers layer upon layer of intrigue. How can he track a murderer who leaves no trail, whose victims seem purposefully random and whose motive reaches far beyond greed and lust, into the darkest recesses of the human soul?",0099472589,9780099472582),Paperback,,496 pages,"

","For over a century, philosophers have argued that philosophy is impossible or useless, or both. Although the basic notion dates back to the days of Socrates, there is still heated disagreement about the nature of truth, reality, knowledge, the good, and God. This may make little practical difference to our lives, but it leaves us with a feeling of radical uncertainty, a feeling described by Kolakowski as ""metaphysical horror."" ""The horror is this,"" he says, ""if nothing truly exists except the Absolute, the Absolute is nothing; if nothing truly exists except myself, I am nothing."" The aim of this book, for Kolakowski, is finding a way out of this seeming dead end.In a trenchant analysis that serves as an introduction to nearly all of Western philosophy, Kolakowski confronts these dilemmas head on through examinations of several prominent philosophers including Descartes, Spinoza, Husserl, and many of the Neo-Platonists. He finds that philosophy may not provide definitive answers to the fundamental questions, yet the quest itself transforms our lives. It may undermine most of our certainties, yet it still leaves room for our spiritual yearnings and religious beliefs.The final sentence of the book captures the hopefulness that has survived the horror of nothingness when Kolakowski asks: ""Is it not reasonable to suspect that if existence were pointless and the universe devoid of meaning, we would never have achieved not only the ability to imagine otherwise, but even the ability to entertain this very thought—to wit, that existence is pointless and the universe devoid of meaning?"" The answer, of course, is clear. Now it is up to readers to take up the challenge of his arguments.",0226450554,9780226450551),Paperback,,144 pages,"

","A new paradigm that delivers a genuine transformation of occultism. The author assumes no previous knowledge, only a willingness to explore what magick offers, yet its apparent to anyone with a background in the subject that Alan Chapman is drawing on a wide range of experience, from classical Crowleyean Magick, to eastern metaphysics, and back again to Discordianism and Chaos Magick. Chapmans writing-style is humorous, direct, seductively logical, and his enthusiasm for the benefits of magick is both tangible and infectious. The novice magician will indeed find themselves equipped to commence all sorts of magickal operations: trance work, enchantment, divination, and even some of the higher forms of spiritual development. To experienced magicians, Chapman offers a subtler challenge: he revitalises magick by cutting it free from the extreme relativism Chaos Magick bequeathed, provocatively redefining it as: the art, science and culture of experiencing truth.",1904658415,9781904658412),Paperback,,170 pages,"

Anticipating a quiet year of research, Emma quickly discovers her work impeded by a range of unforeseen complications. From the start, there is the well-intentioned matchmaking of her vivacious Russian colleague, Elena Smalova, and the unexpected jailing of one of her post-graduate students. More troublesome, however, are the unsolved, brutal night attacks on women near the university and Emma's suspicion that they might be linked to the sinister English professor, Kort Staahl. But, most diverting and disconcerting of all, is Emma's growing attraction to the strikingly handsome Dr. Matthew Lyons, whose kind but deliberately distant demeanor puzzles her.Suspense and dread mount when Kort begins to take a persistent and unsettling interest in Emma. What are Kort's intentions, and what is he capable of? And the mystery surrounding Matthew only deepens when Emma discovers a link between him and the journal.

","Not Even My Name is a rare eyewitness account of the horrors of a little-known, often denied genocide, in which hundreds of thousands of Armenian and Pontic Greek minorities in Turkey were killed during and after World War I. As told by Sano Halo to her daughter, Thea, this is the story of her survival of the death march at age ten that annihilated her family, and the mother-daughter pilgrimage to Turkey in search of Sano's home seventy years after her exile. Sano, a Pontic Greek from a small village near the Black Sea, also recounts the end of her ancient, pastoral way of life in the Pontic Mountains.In the spring of 1920, Turkish soldiers arrived in the village and shouted the proclamation issued by General Kemal Attatürk: ""You are to leave this place. You are to take with you only what you can carry . . . "" After surviving the march, Sano was sold into marriage at age fifteen to a man three times her age who brought her to America. Not Even My Name follows Sano's marriage, the raising of her ten children, and her transformation from an innocent girl who lived an ancient way of life in a remote place to a woman in twentieth-century New York City.Although Turkey actively suppresses the truth about the murder of almost three million of its Christian minorities--Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian--during and after World War I, and the exile of millions of others, here is a first-hand account of the horrors of that genocide.",0312277016,9780312277017),Paperback,,352 pages,"

After ten years she’s returning home, a courageous, forthright woman. But while her body’s scars have healed, her spirit remains fragile, fearing the shadows of her past. Sevenwaters is in turmoil. The fey prince Mac Dara is desperate to see his only son, married to Maeve’s sister, return to the Otherworld.

While the colonists are hard at work developing the planet, General Adolphus secretly builds alliances with the leaders of the other Deep Zone worlds, forming a clandestine coalition against the tyrannical, fossilized government responsible for their exile.What no one knows is this: the planet Hellhole, though damaged and volatile, hides an amazing secret.

","Jean Genet. Çocukluğunda 'piç' ve öksüz. Büyüdüğünde 'hırsız', eşcinsel ve yazar. Babasının kim olduğu belli değildi. Annesi ise onu doğar doğmaz terk etti. Küçüklüğünü geçirdiği yetimhaneden 10 yaşında kaçtı. Tıpkı daha sonra yerleştirildiği her yerden ve katıldığı sömürge birliklerinden kaçtığı gibi... Hayatını Avrupa'nın çeşitli ülkelerinde hırsızlık, kaçakçılık gibi suçlar işleyerek sürdürdü. Sık sık hapse girdi. Fransa'da hırsızlık suçundan onuncu kez yargılanması sonucu müebbet hapse mahkûm edildi. Yazdığı ilk roman André Gide, Jean Cocteau ve Jean-Paul Sartre gibi ünlük yazarların dikkatini çekince, bu yazarların cumhurbaşkanına verdikleri dilekçeyle cezası affedildi. Fransa'daki toplumsal hareketlerden Filistin mücadelesine, Amerika'daki Kara Panterler hareketine kadar çok sayıda mücadeleye, anarşızan bir tavırla destek verdi. Daha çok romanlar ve tiyatro eserleri kaleme almış bir yazar olan Genet, Hırsızın Günlüğü'nde otobiyografik öğelere ön planda yer vermiştir. Yaşamın en ücra köşelerine, hırsızların, fahişelerin, eşcinsellerin, pezevenklerin dünyasına son derece şiirsel bir dille, derin ve incelikli ruhsal çözümlemelerle nüfuz eden Hırsızın Günlüğü, aynı zamanda erkek bedenine düzülmüş en edebi övgülere rastlanılan bir yapıttır.

By turns heroic and calculating, compassionate and utterly merciless, Alexander recounts with a warrior’s unflinching eye for detail the blood, the terror, and the tactics of his greatest battlefield victories. Whether surviving his father’s brutal assassination, presiding over a massacre, or weeping at the death of a beloved comrade-in-arms, Alexander never denies the hard realities of the code by which he lives: the virtues of war. But as much as he was feared by his enemies, he was loved and revered by his friends, his generals, and the men who followed him into battle. Often outnumbered, never outfought, Alexander conquered every enemy the world stood against him–but the one he never saw coming. . . .",0553382055,9780553382051),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","The appeal of Queen Maud's wardrobe is immediate: apart from its intrinsic quality, it documents an extraordinary era of fashion history, from the decorative but elaborate dress of the Victorian era to the streamlined chic of the 1930s: clothes for the modern working monarch. It encompasses the public and private like no other collection, from sumptuous state gowns and elegant evening dresses for official occasions to her riding habits, winter sportswear, and simple tailored suits for afternoons in the garden with her grandchildren. Maud engaged with contemporary fashion throughout her long life, and commissioned many of the great designers of the day, notably Worth, Blancquaert and Morin-Blossier. Her wardrobe illustrates the impeccable standards of couture dressmaking and tailoring of the period. Style and Splendour showcases some of the most spectacular garments, now in the collection of the National Museum of Art/Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in Oslo, and sets them clearly in the context of Queen Maud's life and times.",1851774548,9781851774548),Hardcover,,112 pages,"

","Summer vacation with her family was supposed to be a restorative time for Kate, who'd lost her close friend Elizabeth in a plane crash. But when she inherits a trunk of Elizabeth's journals, they reveal a woman far different than the cheerful wife and mother Kate thought she knew.The complicated portrait of Elizabeth - her upbringing, her marriage, and journey to motherhood - makes Kate question not just their friendship, but her own deepest beliefs about loyalty and honesty at a moment of uncertainty in her own marriage. When an unfamiliar man's name appears in Elizabeth's pages, Kate realises the extent of what she didn't know about her best friend, including where she was really going when she died.Written with grace, depth, and honesty, this is a story of two women - their friendship, their marriages, private ambitions and fears. And what they chose to keep hidden.",,,Paperback,Australian Edition,408 pages,"

","Rumble es la historia de una chica que se tira de cabeza a la pileta para descubrir que el fondo estaba mucho más cerca de lo que pensaba. Aunque mucho no piensa. Tiene doce años, es hija de una familia numerosa, católica y de derecha que vive en un barrio acomodado, y lo único que le importa es escaparse a la calle donde sucede su verdadera vida. Las aventuras/desventuras de esta mini-adulta que todo lo descubre como quien ya todo lo ha visto transcurren en la convulsa Buenos Aires de los años setenta, entre la muerte de Perón y el Mundial 78. Los rituales inútiles de los padres, las miserias entre hermanos, la relación ambigua con su amigo colectivero, el internado para chicas pobres, su experiencia alucinógena, el tiro que se le escapa... todo va perfilando el viaje iniciático de esta autoexiliada de su colegio, de su familia y de su propia clase. Hay en Rumble amor por las imágenes, calidez en el trato de las emociones, ternura y una buena dosis de maldad. La música de las páginas del libro, el tono y el lenguaje resuenan con una gracia sorprendente. Maitena Burundarena logra dar vida a un relato admirable y a un personaje con voz original. La voz de una niña inocente y cínica que no puede dejar de transmitirnos su temblor y ese Rumble que al final de la historia se revela único.",,,,,286 pages,"

","An ancient prophecy foretells that the world would end on 21 December 2012 . . . Deep in the jungles of Central America, an indigenous man discovers a unique and priceless treasure - a beautifully painted codex that has survived for centuries within the ruins of an undiscovered ancient Maya city. Knowing that this rare artifact could be worth millions, the looter smuggles it into the US - but unbeknownst to him, he has brought something far more dangerous across the border . . . In the first week of December 2012, the codex finds its way into the hands of the Antiquities Curator of the Getty Museum, Chel Manu, the world authority on ancient Mayan inscriptions. She is torn between her duty to alert the authorities and this once in a lifetime chance to translate the codex herself.Meanwhile - in an LA hospital, an unidentified man is dying of Fatal Insomnia, a rare and highly infectious neurological disease. The patient speaks only in a garbled Mayan dialect - and Chel Manu is called in to interpret his dying words . . . just as countless others in the city begin to show signs of infection. Within days the world seems to be unravelling, hurtling towards the prophesied apocalypse . . . and deciphering the codex is the only hope for humanity . . .",0385341407,9780385341400),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","All Sergeant Evrial Yara wanted was to protect the young emperor from those plotting to kill him. Joining forces with a group of notorious outlaws wasn’t part of the plan, especially not when one of them is determined to charm her out of her uniform at every turn. Working with the criminals might have been worth it if their efforts had saved the emperor, but it seems he’s not the rightful heir to the throne.... Evrial may have thrown away her career for nothing. To make matters worse, fate isn’t going to give her time to calmly decide what to do next. While she’s traveling back to the capital with Amaranthe Lokdon and the rest of the outlaws, Evrial uncovers artifacts that have been smuggled aboard their steamboat. They’re deadly enough to threaten the entire city, perhaps the entire empire. Oh, and they could kill everybody on board the boat too. These scenarios just weren’t discussed in the Enforcer Academy. This 56,000-word novella takes place between Books 5 and 6 in the Emperor’s Edge series.",1301839728,9781301839728),ebook,,,"

","Το ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" γράφτηκε σε μια εποχή πολιτικά ταραγμένη για την Ελλάδα. Η ήττα του 1897 ήταν ακόμα νωπή, το καθεστώς ασταθές, άνθιζε η διαφθορά, η εκπαίδευση δεν ανταποκρινόταν στις ευρωπαϊκές αντιλήψεις περί παιδαγωγικής. Από την άλλη, το γλωσσικό ζήτημα έκαιγε. Ο Εκπαιδευτικός Όμιλος, του οποίου ήταν μέλος και η Δέλτα, συσπείρωνε διανοούμενους, όπως λογοτέχνες (Βάρναλης, Καζαντζάκης, Νιρβάνας), εκπαιδευτικούς και παιδαγωγούς (Γληνός, Δελμούζος) φιλολόγους (Σαρής, Τριανταφυλλίδης), με στόχο μεταρρυθμίσεις που αφορούσαν στην εισαγωγή της δημοτικής γλώσσας στην εκπαίδευση και στην εξάπλωση νέων ιδεών για την ανατροφή των παιδιών.ΜΑΡΙΖΑ ΝΤΕΚΑΣΤΡΟΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" είναι ένα πολιτικό παραμύθι, είναι μια πλατωνική Πολιτεία για παιδιά, είναι η ιστορία μιας παραμυθένιας πατρίδας... Της Ελλάδας.Η Πηνελόπη Δ. είναι πιστή, όπως τ' όνομά της, στις ιδέες της μέσα στο βιβλίο, πιστή μέχρι το θάνατο σ'όλα όσα επέλεξε να ξεχάσει και σ' αυτά που τόσο μεθοδικά προτείνει.Τα ονόματα των πρωταγωνιστών τούς ανήκουν εκ φύσεως και διηγούνται κι από μόνα τους την ιστορία. Ο καλός βασιλιάς, που μετρήθηκαν οι μέρες του, λέγεται Συνετός, και μετά αρχίζει η βασιλεία του Αστόχαστου και της Παλάβως στη Χώρα των Μοιρολάτρων. Μέχρι που, από τη γειτονική χώρα, φτάνει, αντί για οικονομική βοήθεια, η ύστατη προσβολή: μια γαϊδουροκεφαλή με τενεκεδένιο στέμμα.Κι εδώ ακριβώς αρχίζει το παραμύθι για τα απογοητευμένα μάτια μας. Ο γιος του Αστόχαστου λέγεται Συνετός Β΄ και αρκεί να πούμε ότι στο τέλος θα παντρευτεί τη Γνώση, κόρη της Φρόνησης, λες κι έχει πάρει το αξίωμά του κατευθείαν από τον Σωκράτη.Ξαναδιαβάζοντας το βιβλίο, ένας μεγάλος θα νιώσει ίσως αμήχανα στις μέρες μας, αντιμέτωπος μ'αυτή την ελπίδα που δεν διαψεύδεται και με την αρετή που ξαναχτίζει τον κόσμο - χωρίς καθόλου μαγικά ξόρκια ή δανεικά κονδύλια, αλλά χάρη σε πολύ σκληρή δουλειά για το κοινό καλό. Γιατί ένας μεγάλος αυτόματα θα μετρήσει την απόσταση ανάμεσα σ' αυτά που επέλεξε να υποτιμήσει και να ξεχάσει και στα τόσα που μεθοδικά προτείνει το βιβλίο. Γιατί η Πηνελόπη Δ. έχει προβλέψει ακόμα και για τη σωστή εκμετάλλευση της φύσης, έχει σκεφτεί ακόμα και τους φυλακισμένους να ξανακάνει ανθρώπους μέσα από την πιο σκληρή, είναι η αλήθεια, δουλειά των λατομείων. Και παρόλο που δεν ξεφεύγει από την παρουσία μιας ελέω Θεού βασιλικής οικογένειας, το βασιλόπουλο είναι τόσο ταπεινό, εργατικό και ενάρετο που θα μπορούσε να είναι ένας αυτοδημιούργητος λαϊκός ήρωας.ΜΑΡΙΑ ΜΗΤΣΟΡΑΗ Πηνελόπη Δέλτα φώτισε τα παιδικά μας χρόνια, τα κατοίκησε και τα ενθάρρυνε δίνοντας ""όνομα"" -και μια σπάνια αύρα- στα ανείπωτα της ψυχής. Κι αν η γενιά μας στρέφει ακόμη το βλέμμα της νοσταλγικά σ' εκείνα τα αναγνώσματα, οι τάξεις των νεόκοπων αναγνωστών ούτε λιγότερο πυκνές είναι ούτε λιγότερο ένθερμες.ΖΥΡΑΝΝΑ ΖΑΤΕΛΗΤο ""Παραμύθι χωρίς όνομα"" (πρώτη έκδοση: 1910) αποτελεί πραγματικά το πιο συναρπαστικό εγερτήριο σάλπισμα για μια Ελλάδα της εργατικότητας, της τιμιότητας, της προκοπής, της μόρφωσης, της εθνικής περηφάνειας. Παντοτινά επίκαιρο.Η παρούσα νέα, συμπληρωμένη έκδοση περιλαμβάνει επίμετρο της Μαρίζας Ντεκάστρο και χρονολόγιο του Αλ. Π. Ζάννα (επιμελητή του έργου της Π. Σ. Δέλτα), το οποίο μνημονεύει τα σημαντικά γεγονότα της ζωής της Πηνελόπης Δέλτα, καθώς και παράλληλα γεγονότα της πολιτικής, κοινωνικής και πνευματικής ζωής στην Ελλάδα και τον κόσμο.Επίμετρο: Μαρίζα Ντεκάστρο Χρονολόγιο: Αλ.

","The Los Angeles police are investigating two strings of gruesome deaths. One killer has left several horribly mangled corpses; the other murderer kills his victims seemingly without touching them. The investigators have only a single set of fingerprints to link the two series of crimes. — Journalist Peter Jacobs is dragged into the investigation when he receives an anonymous call from someone who knows more than he should about the murders. They agree to meet at a specific place and time, but the caller never shows up -- …and the killings continue.When Julie Moore, a graduate student researching Near Death Experiences, falls in love with Peter, she has no way of knowing that she has placed herself in the deadly sights of the Cold One. The Cold One needs Peter to complete its mysterious designs -- but it does not hate Julie for interfering. It feels nothing -- no hate, no fear, no love -- and Its mere existence threatens all living things.Until recently, Jerry Washington belonged to a violent street gang. Trying to go straight, Jerry meets Susan Darly, an upper-crust high school sweetheart, and finds that life can be warm and wonderful. Then Susan almost drowns -- and is terribly changed. She has become as cold as death, and Jerry is determined to find out why.In India, Govinda Sharma's spiritual master has given him a dangerous job -- to pursue a seemingly invincible man, a blind man who can dominate another's will with a mere thought. This man will lead Govinda to the Cold One, and to a great truth that will shatter him to the core.Govinda Sharma, Jerry Washington, and Peter Jacobs are the last defenders of mankind.The Cold One knows who they are. It knows they are coming. And it does not care.",0812512456,9780812512458),Paperback,,416 pages,"

She lived in an upper middle class neighborhood in Santa Monica with her mom, dad, and Berkeley-bound older brother. She was a good girl, living a good life...but one party changed everything. One party, where she took one taste—and liked it. Really liked it.Social drinking and drugging lead to more, faster, harder... She convinced herself that she was no different from anyone else who liked to party. But the evidence indicates otherwise: Soon she was she hanging out with an edgy crowd, blowing off school and everything she used to care about, all to find her next high.But what goes up must come down, and everything—from her first swig, to her last breath—is chronicled in the diary she left behind.",,,,,,,"['Young Adult', 'Fiction', 'Realistic Fiction']"

","Every successful brand in history is inherently unpopular with a specific demographic. Somewhere along the way, people felt they had to be popular in order to be successful, when in fact, the opposite is true. The brands playing in the space you want to dominate have already figured out the inherent power of being unpopular. In The Power of Unpopular, you'll discover the difference between flash-in-the-pan brand tactics and those designed to place you miles above the competition.Brand Personality: What's yours? Explore the importance of taking a stand and why brands become road kill without a distinct personality. Community: It's the number one thing that unpopular brands have figured out--learn how to build yours. Brand Advocacy: It knows no scale and your fans don't care how big you are. A guide for businesses on the proper care and feeding of their biggest asset. Erika Napoletano's irreverent yet never insincere tone takes readers on a colloquial and actionable journey, producing concepts that readers can immediately graft onto their existing business strategies. Complete with case studies of businesses from across the country, this is the book that couples theory with practice, creating pathways for business owners of any size and age.

","The Man Booker Prize finalist Far to Go by acclaimed author Alison Pick is historical fiction at its very best.When Czechoslovakia relinquishes the Sudetenland to Hitler, the powerful influence of Nazi propaganda sweeps through towns and villages like a sinister vanguard of the Reich's advancing army. A fiercely patriotic secular Jew, Pavel Bauer is helpless to prevent his world from unraveling as first his government, then his business partners, then his neighbors turn their back on his affluent, once-beloved family. Only the Bauers' adoring governess, Marta, sticks by Pavel, his wife, Anneliese, and their little son, Pepik, bound by her deep affection for her employers and friends. But when Marta learns of their impending betrayal at the hands of her lover, Ernst, Pavel's best friend, she is paralyzed by her own fear of discovery—even as the endangered family for whom she cares so deeply struggles with the most difficult decision of their lives.Interwoven with a present-day narrative that gradually reveals the fate of the Bauer family during and after the war, Far to Go is a riveting family epic, love story, and psychological drama.",0062034626,9780062034625),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","A bestseller in its original German edition and subsequently translated into more than a dozen languages, Joachim Fest's Hitler has become a classic portrait of a man, a nation, and an era. Fest tells and interprets the extraordinary story of a man's and a nation's rise from impotence to absolute power, as Germany and Hitler, from shared premises, entered into their covenant. He shows Hitler exploiting the resentments of the shaken, post-World War I social order and seeing through all that was hollow behind the appearance of power, at home and abroad. Fest reveals the singularly penetrating politician, hypnotizing Germans and outsiders alike with the scope of his projects and the theatricality of their presentation. Fest also, perhaps most importantly, brilliantly uncovers the destructive personality who aimed at and achieved devastation on an unprecedented scale. As history and as biography, this is a towering achievement, a compelling story told in a way only a German could tell it, ""dispassionately, but from the inside.""

","The Beatles' first performance in the U.S. was a milestone in American pop culture and the beginning of the British Invasion. For many of the 73 million people tuned in to watch, it was a life-changing experience. In fact, there is an urban legend that says that in the hour they performed on that February night in 1964, not a major crime was committed in New York City.Or was there?Meet Sonny Carter, an aging bank robber just recently released from prison after a 25-year stretch for bank robbery. Unrepentant, Sonny is determined to finish what he started back in '39: knocking over New York City's prestigious Hudson National Bank and Trust Company. It's not gonna be easy, though. Banks are a whole lot tougher than they used to be, and the members of his old gang are just about ready for the retirement home. And if that wasn't enough, adding insult to injury is the fact that the stool pigeon responsible for Sonny's lengthy incarceration is now the president of the very bank he wants so desperately to hit. This time, however, Sonny has a plan that just might prove to be foolproof, thanks to two unlikely sources: a sexy bank employee with secrets and a shady past, and the four unsuspecting mop tops from Liverpool about to make their historic American debut on the Ed Sullivan Show.Can't Buy Me Love is a lighthearted suspense novel featuring four ex-cons who plan and execute a five-million-dollar heist. In one night, these partners in crime face conflict with New Jersey mobsters, unexpected love, loss, and bittersweet triumph during one of the most important eras in American Rock & Roll history.",,,ebook,,331 pages,"

","The man at the door carries a vital message for the King of Caelius, but he is mortally wounded and near death when he knocks at Elspeth's door. The young woman, living alone in a ramshackle house, at the edge of starvation is stunned by the arrival and death of the messenger. Abandoned by her abusive father and left to care for her sickly mother until her death, she struggles to survive both physically and emotionally and fantasizes about rescue by the young Prince of Caelius to ease her misery. Seizing the opportunity to chase her fantasy, she sets out on the man’s horse to deliver the message herself.Arriving at the castle, Elspeth delivers the message to King Fredric, who warmly welcomes her, offering her acceptance and love. But trusting his response is a difficult venture: she must reconcile it with her lowly, abusive past, while facing her fears, and embracing the longings she has denied for a lifetime. Struggling with her inability to trust, she makes an astounding discovery and comes face-to-face with the depth of the King’s love.",,,Kindle Edition,,286 pages,"

","Originally written under a pseudonym, this thrilling novel of passion in post-World War II London was banned upon its publication in the late 1960s, and is only now being republished under the author's real name. Edith Templeton creates an indelible character in the smartly dressed Louisa, a savvy young woman in the midst of a divorce who meets a charismatic man in a pub and within an hour has been sexually conquered by him on a garden bench. Thus begins her baffling but magnetic love affair with, and virtual enslavement to, Richard Gordon.Gordon, a psychiatrist, keeps Louisa in his thrall with his almost omniscient ability to see through her and she, in turn, is gripped by the deep, unexpected pleasure of complete submission. As they venture further and further into the depths -- both psychological and sexual -- she begins, for the first time, to understand her troubled history and the self that has emerged from it.In her clean, precise style, with every social nuance and motive exquisitely observed, Templeton delivers a tightly wound drama, unsparingly forthright in its description of how this form of love can bring incomparable rapture. Louisa's unsettling story has more than the ring of truth to it: it is told with urgency and relish, and its outcome, which leaves Louisa enlightened and changed forever, is profoundly satisfying.",0375421947,9780375421945),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","At fifteen, Iris is a hobo of sorts -- no home, no family, no direction. After her mother’s early death, Iris’s father focuses on big plans for his new shoe stores and his latest girlfriend, and has no time for his daughter. Unbeknownst to her, he hires Iris out as housekeeper and companion for a country doctor’s elderly mother. Suddenly Iris is alone, stuck in gritty rural Missouri, too far from her only friend Leroy and too close to a tenant farmer, Cecil Deets, who menaces the neighbors and, Iris suspects, his own daughter. Iris is buoyed by the warmth and understanding the doctor and his mother show her, but just as she starts to break out of her shell, tragedy strikes. Iris must find the guts and cunning to take aim at the devil incarnate and discover if she is really as helpless—or as hopeless—as she once believed. Lyrical, yet humorous, Barbara Stuber’s debut novel is the unforgettable story of a girl who struggles to cast aside her long-standing grief and doubt and, in the span of one dusty summer, learn to trust, hope, and—ultimately—love.",1416997032,9781416997030),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

With twelve separate yet interconnected stories, Shu Jiang Lu alternates between storyteller and listener as she relays haunting memories and explores the devastating effect of Mao’s anticultural Cultural Revolution. Lu weaves together the voices of multiple real and fantastic characters: her parents and their treasured yet forbidden bookcase; the mysterious vendors beckoning from Pear Flower Alley; the immortal martial hero; the reactionary opera singer and the black demon novelist; the whispering ghost and dancing fairy; and the author herself, discovering her storyteller’s voice in the military camps of her youth.

","This gripping and triumphant memoir follows a living legend of extreme mountaineering as he makes his assault on history, one 8,000-meter summit at a time.For eighteen years Ed Viesturs pursued climbing’s holy grail: to stand atop the world’s fourteen 8,000-meter peaks, without the aid of bottled oxygen. But No Shortcuts to the Top is as much about the man who would become the first American to achieve that goal as it is about his stunning quest. As Viesturs recounts the stories of his most harrowing climbs, he reveals a man torn between the flat, safe world he and his loved ones share and the majestic and deadly places where only he can go.A preternaturally cautious climber who once turned back 300 feet from the top of Everest but who would not shrink from a peak (Annapurna) known to claim the life of one climber for every two who reached its summit, Viesturs lives by an unyielding motto, “Reaching the summit is optional. Getting down is mandatory.” It is with this philosophy that he vividly describes fatal errors in judgment made by his fellow climbers as well as a few of his own close calls and gallant rescues. And, for the first time, he details his own pivotal and heroic role in the 1996 Everest disaster made famous in Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. In addition to the raw excitement of Viesturs’s odyssey, No Shortcuts to the Top is leavened with many funny moments revealing the camaraderie between climbers. It is more than the first full account of one of the staggering accomplishments of our time; it is a portrait of a brave and devoted family man and his beliefs that shaped this most perilous and magnificent pursuit.",0767924703,9780767924702),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Sometimes the adventure chooses you.Lover of fine poetry and lousy choose-your-own-adventure novels, Professor Sebastian Swift was once the bad-boy darling of the literati. The only lines he does these days are Browning, Frost, and Cummings. Even his relationship with the hot, handsome Wolfe Neck Police chief, Max Prescott, is healthy.When one of his most talented students comes to him bruised and begging for help, Swift hands over the keys to his Orson Island cabin - only to find out that the boy's father is dead and the police are suspicious. In an instant, the stable life Swift has built for himself hangs on finding the boy and convincing him to give himself up before Max figures out Swift's involvement in the case.Max enjoys splitting an infinitive or two with his favorite nutty professor, but he's not much for sonnets or Shakespeare. He likes being lied to even less. Yet his instincts - and his heart - tell him his lover is being played. Max can forgive lies and deception, but a dangerous enemy may not stop until Swift is heading up his own dead poet's society.Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that Josh Lanyon's smart, sexy, sophisticated stories may prove hazardous to your heart.",1609282736,9781609282738),ebook,1st Edition,161 pages,"

","A massive terrorist attack on Arsenal's new stadium - a woman grieving for her husband and son - a unique, twisted powerhouse of a novel.Angry, funny, heart-rending and subversive, few first novels are as compelling as this one. From the first sentence of her open letter to Osama Bin Laden, Incendiary's unforgettable narrator won't let you go, and her cry of raw outrage at the murder of her family rapidly develops into something very unexpected. Part thriller, part satire, part memorial to a dead child, it shows us an East End woman trying every way she can to climb out of despair, and a society in the grip of fear and self-interest. It is a story in which everyone is compromised - where personal betrayals reflect national ones, and Britain's class system is a ticking bomb.Shocking but tender, brutal yet hopeful, Incendiary forces us to see what we'd rather not see, yet never fails to entertain. The writing moves from horror to humour with terrifying ease. The power of the storytelling is mesmerising. Few writers have pinned a generation down on the mat like this and refused to allow it up till it admits it's rotten.",0701179058,9780701179052),Paperback,,243 pages,"

","New York. 2120. American has been decimated, wiped out from the second Civil War. In this post-apocalyptic world, survivors are far and few between. And most of those who do survive are members of the violent gangs, predators who live in the big cities. They patrol the countryside looking for slaves, for fresh victims to bring back into the city for their favorite death sport: Arena One. The death stadium where opponents are made to fight to the death, in the most barbaric of ways. There is only one rule to the arena: no one survives. Ever. Deep in the wilderness, high up in the Catskill Mountains, 17 year old Brooke Moore manages to survive, hiding out with her younger sister, Bree. They are careful to avoid the gangs of slaverunners who patrol the countryside. But one day, Brooke is not as careful as she can be, and Bree is captured. The slaverunners take her away, heading to the city, and to what will be a certain death. Brooke, a Marine’s daughter, was raised to be tough, to never back down from a fight. When her sister is taken, Brooke mobilizes, uses everything at her disposal to chase down the slaverunners and get her sister back. Along the way she runs into Ben, 17, another survivor like her, whose brother was taken. Together, they team up on their rescue mission. What follows is a post-apocalyptic, action-packed thriller, as the two of them pursue the slaverunners on the most dangerous ride of their lives, following them deep into the heart of New York. Along the way, if they are to survive, they will have to make some of the hardest choices and sacrifices of their lives, encountering obstacles neither of them had expected—including their unexpected feelings for each other. Will they rescue their siblings? Will they make it back? And will they, themselves, have to fight in the arena?",0984975314,9780984975310),Paperback,,300 pages,"

A Salharan soldier with no name, no purpose but to kill, he refuses to bend to the Wolf who takes him prisoner and forces upon him a despicable Krian name.A man with nothing to lose...When the rest of his army is slaughtered by Illussor soldiers desperately seeking his prisoner, Dieter determines to hold fast—both for answers and in revenge for the men he lost. But answers and revenge are hard to come by when surrounded by secrets and treachery, and the man least likely to kill him is the prisoner who most wants him dead.",,,Paperback,,348 pages,"

","W książce tej jest wszystko, czego można chcieć się dowiedzieć o życiu w socjalizmie. Oczywiście życiu inteligenta. A szczególnie inteligenta warszawiaka.Na kartach Dziennika 1954 spotkamy Herberta, Jasienicę, Kisiela, Turowicza, by wspomnieć tylko tych, których wspominać warto. Poznajemy też prozę i poezję bytowania młodego pisarza, świetnego obserwatora, znakomitego stylisty, którego wkrótce pozbyto się z Polski na stałe. Sam Tyrmand pisze o dzienniku tak: ""Tak, chodzi o świadectwo dla samego siebie, o wystawienie świadectwa memu życiu, moim pragnieniom i myślom, mojej epoce, z którą jestem związany nieskończonością węzłów. Ma to być świadectwo z pierwszej ręki, złożone przez stosunkowo najlepiej zorientowanego w danej sprawie świadka. Ale – częściowo nie. Tak silnie pożądam sprawdzenia samego siebie, mych słuszności i niesłuszności, mych możliwości i zdolności, a więc tego, czego tak uparcie odmawia mi moja aktualna sytuacja. Nie mam talentu kontemplacji ani daru tworzenia w imię samego aktu tworzenia. Jak powiedział mi ostatnio Kisiel, noszę w sobie wielką potrzebę i umiejętność dzielenia się z ludźmi moją wewnętrzną pracą myśli. Z najgłębszego powołania czuję się dziennikarzem, stąd konstrukcje mych przemyśleń ulegają dezaktualizacji, ponadto nie wierzę w możliwość własnego wysiłku nad kompozycją dzieła sztuki nieprzeznaczonego dla kogoś konkretnego w czasie i przestrzeni. Dlatego zdecydowałem, że dziennik przyniesie mi ulgę.""",8361297057,9788361297055),Paperback,,368 pages,"

They stay in your mind's eye until death.""For thirteen days in April 1994, Reverien Rurangwa hid in silence with his family in a tiny cabin on the side of a mountain until they were finally hunted down by their Hutu neighbors--men with whom his father had often drunk a beer after work. In minutes, forty-three members of his family were massacred in front of his eyes. Although part of his hand was cut off, Rurangwa managed to escape before the assassins set fire to the building.Rurangwa was fifteen and alone in the world; his only souvenir of his childhood was a battered family photograph. He tried to return to his home but was once again forced to flee in fear of his life. In this extraordinary memoir of survival, Rurangwa recounts how he struggled to come to terms with extreme loss, physical deformity, and a life in exile.Published to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the genocide, ""My Stolen Rwanda"" is tender and intimate. Rurangwa's story jumps from the pages with energy and even humor.Part of the proceeds from the sale of ""My Stolen Rwanda"" will go to Ibuka--Memory and Justice, which supports victims of the genocide.

When her husband hears God's call to become a preacher, Rachel Jackson Adams is distressed -- she grew up a preacher's daughter, and knows how difficult life under the microscope can be for a reverend's family. But hot-headed Rachel has toned down her wild ways, and for the sake of her marriage and her two children, she is now the reluctant first lady of Zion Hill, unafraid to rock the boat with her unconventional ideas for revitalizing the church. When her son, Jordan, begins fighting at school, Rachel turns to the boy's father, Bobby -- Rachel's first love from years ago. Married now himself, there should be nothing between them except their concern for Jordan -- so why does seeing Bobby again feel so distractingly tempting? With her brothers facing dramas of their own, and her father, Reverend Simon Jackson, recovering from illness, Rachel must listen carefully to discover what God truly wants for her -- and to decide if Bobby is the lover of her dreams or the devil in disguise",1416521658,9781416521655),Paperback,,283 pages,"

Such a person is the inimitable, timeless genius who is Billy Connolly. His effortlessly wicked whimsy has entranced, enthralled – and split the sides of – thousands upon thousands of adoring audiences.And when he isn't doing that…he's turning in award-winning performances on film and television.He's the man who needs no introduction, and yet he is the ultimate enigma. From a troubled and desperately poor childhood in the docklands of Glasgow he is now the intimate of household names the world over.How did this happen, who is the real Billy Connolly? Only one person can answer that question: his wife, Pamela Stephenson. Pamela’s writing combines the very personal with a frank objectivity that makes for a compelling, moving and hugely entertaining biography. This is the real Billy Connolly.This genre-defining book is now re-released for a new generation of comedy fans, with a stunning package and a new Foreword from the author. Pamela’s vision of Billy is as true now as it ever was – as groundbreaking, as moving and as laugh-out-loud funny – and here she brings the book fully into its context, as one of the most influential biographies ever written.",0007110928,9780007110926),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","With his stirring, rapturous first novel--originally published in 1956 --James Salter established himself as the most electrifying prose stylist since Hemingway. Four decades later, it is clear that he also fashioned the most enduring fiction ever about aerial warfare.Captain Cleve Connell arrives in Korea with a single goal: to become an ace, one of that elite fraternity of jet pilots who have downed five MIGs. But as his fellow airmen rack up kill after kill--sometimes under dubious circumstances--Cleve's luck runs bad. Other pilots question his guts. Cleve comes to question himself. And then in one icy instant 40,000 feet above the Yalu River, his luck changes forever. Filled with courage and despair, eerie beauty and corrosive rivalry, The Hunters is a landmark in the literature of war.",0375703926,9780375703928),Paperback,,256 pages,"

",All current and future gun control advocates should have this book in their book library. This book can be utilized as an effective training tool for Second Amendment debate with pro-gun facets of society. Byron Goines explains the insurrectionist interpretation of the Second Amendment that has been utilized for years by pro-gun facets of society to deceive Americans. The Constitution of the United States of America is clearly against insurrections yet pro-gun facets of society continue to deceive Americans by saying the Second Amendment gives them the right to bear arms in order to rise up against a tyrannical government which is clearly an insurrection. Bearing arms against the United States government is an insurrection and rebellion against the United States and the Constitution specifically addresses insurrections in detail and is totally against insurrections throughout. Byron Goines explains insurrections and how they are addressed as treason in the Constitution of the United States of America along with the Constitutional penalty for elected representatives who engage in insurrection or rebellion against the United States. Learn what the Constitution says about insurrections as Byron Goines gives a Constitutional exegesis debunking the deceptive insurrectionist Second Amendment interpretation given by pro-gun facets of society.,,,Audiobook,,9 pages,"

","Regeane is a fatherless royal relation who happens to be a werewolf. Her guardian, Gundabald, and his venal son Hugo plan to recoup their fortunes by marrying Regeane to a wealthy bridegroom, even though she might inadvertently make him into a bedtime snack. Gundabald forces her into apparent compliance by threatening to reveal her secret to the Church, which would burn her at the stake. As the bridegroom, Maeniel, journeys to Rome to claim her, Regeane discovers allies in her quest to defeat Gundabald's machinations, including some very strong, funny, and levelheaded women. Unfortunately for Regeane, she also has more powerful enemies than Gundabald.  Alice Borchardt brings 8th-century Rome vividly to life. Her language is earthy and sensuously descriptive: ""The wolf visited Regeane's eyes and ears. The girl staggered slightly with the shock. The light in the square became intense. Smells an overwhelming experience: wet stone, damp air, musty clothing, perspirations shading from ancient sticky filth to fresh acrid adrenal alarm.""	  Borchardt is Anne Rice's sister, but she writes a very different sort of tale. Ghosts, the dead, and supernatural forces are here, but so is laugh-out-loud humor and a happy ending. --Nona Vero",0006483852,9780006483854),Paperback,,460 pages,"

","بِريود كلمة إنجليزية تعني فترة زمنية. والكلمة لها أصل يوناني من كلمة ""بِريودوس"" وتعني الزمن. وفي علم اللغويات Linguistics كلمة ""بِريود"" تعني النقطة التي توضع في آخر الجملة لتدل على نهايتها. أما في العصر الحديث فقد صارت الكلمة تُشير إلى الدورة الشهرية، والتي تُعَد من أكبر التابوهات في عالم النساء. وكعادتنا حين نود إضفاء شيء من التقبُّل إلى غير المُتقبَّل دخلت كلمة ""بِريود"" إلى عالمنا الناطق بالعربية لوصف تلك الأيام. وفي الحضارات القديمة لم تكن الدورة الشهرية من الأسرار، بل كانت واضحة للجميع كجزء أساسي من أنوثة المرأة التي ارتفعت إلى منصب الإلهة، وحكمت البلدان، واستحوذت على مكانة شديدة العلو كساحرة أو حكيمة أو عرَّافة. أما أيام النزيف في الدورة الشهرية فكانت فترة مُقدَّسة sacred time أحيطت بهالة من الإجلال، كهِبة أو مِنحة من الطبيعة أو من الآلهة للمرأة، تتسم بنشاط رُوحاني وقدرة عالية على التواصل مع الطبيعة أو الآلهة. وكان يصحب بلوغ الفتاة ونزول أول قطرات من دمائها الكثير من الاحتفالات لوصولها إلى هذه المرحلة المتطورة من الحياة.ثم جاءت الأديان السماوية تحمل فكرة الإله الواحد الذكر ذي السُّلطة الأبوية المطلقة، وحرمت المرأة من ذلك التقديس لطبيعتها كأنثى. فالله مذكر، فالأنبياء والرُّسل والعلماء والمفسرون رجال، والمرأة لا تصلح لهذه الأعمال، فهي الأضعف جسمانيًّا، وهي العاطفية متقلِّبة المزاج المفتقدة للعقلانية، وهي مصدر الفتنة للرِّجال، فهي الزانية إذا فاح عطرها أو بدت زينتها للعالم، وهي التي خُلِقَت من ضلع أعوج وحملت عبء الخطيئة الأولى فتعاونت مع الشيطان على غواية آدم ليأكل من الشجرة المحرمة ويطرد من الجنة، فكان أكثر اهل النار من النساء. ثم اضافت الأديان السماوية أعباءا نفسية إلى أيام النزيف، وكأن عبء الألم الشديد لا يكفي فتم إلصاق تهمة النجاسة إلى المرأة في هذه الأيام، وتم فرض عزلة دينية واجتماعية أضافت إلى العزلة النفسية والإحساس بالخجل والقذارة آلاما تفوق ألم النزيف. ثم انتقلت الفكرة في سلاسة شديدة إلى مجتمعاتنا الذكورية التي تمجد الخجل في النساء وتنتقده في الرجال. أصبحت تلك الفترة تابوه ليس من الممكن الاقتراب منه، فيجب أن تخفيه البنت عن أبيها وأخيها بل وقد تخفيه عن زوجها إذا أمكن. فتم فرض ذلك الحصار التاريخي على هذه الأيام لتتألم المرأة في صمت. ولكن صمت المرأة يتحول إلى صخب داخلي يختفي عن أسماع لعالم ويدوي فقط في جنبات النفس ليصبح صمتا أنثويا صاخبا لا يسمعه الرجال.في هذه المجموعة تخلَّيت عن كل ما يميز الرجال واقتربت في حذر من ذلك العالم الخفي الغامض، واستمعت واستمتعت بهذا الصخب، فكان يجب أن أشارك العالم شيئًا منه.محمد متولي",,,,,97 pages,"

","""Walk barefoot and the thorns will hurt you…"" —Iraqi-Turkmen proverb A riveting story of hope and despair, of elation and longing, Barefoot in Baghdad takes you to the front lines of a different kind of battle, where the unsung freedom fighters are strong, vibrant—and female.An American aid worker of Arab descent, Manal Omar moves to Iraq to help as many women as she can rebuild their lives. She quickly finds herself drawn into the saga of a people determined to rise from the ashes of war and sanctions and rebuild their lives in the face of crushing chaos. This is a chronicle of Omar's friendships with several Iraqis whose lives are crumbling before her eyes. It is a tale of love, as her relationship with one Iraqi man intensifies in a country in turmoil. And it is the heartrending stories of the women of Iraq, as they grapple with what it means to be female in a homeland you no longer recognize.""Manal Omar captures the complex reality of living and working in war-torn Iraq, a reality that tells the story of love and hope in the midst of bombs and explosions.""—Zainab Salbi, founder and CEO of Women for Women International, and author (with Laurie Becklund) of the national bestselling book Between Two Worlds: Escape from Tyranny: Growing Up in the Shadow of Saddam""A fascinating, honest, and inspiring portrait of a women's rights activist in Iraq, struggling to help local women while exploring her own identity. Manal Omar is a skilled guide into Iraq, as she understands the region, speaks Arabic, and wears the veil. At turns funny and tragic, she carries a powerful message for women, and delivers it through beautiful storytelling.""—Christina Asquith, author of Sisters in War: A Story of Love, Family and Survival in the New Iraq""At turns funny and tragic…a powerful message for women, [delivered] through beautiful storytelling.""—Christina Asquith, author of Sisters in War",,,Kindle Edition,,269 pages,"

","Distinguished British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) set off a series of movements that drastically altered the ways in which economists view the world. In his most important work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), Keynes critiqued the laissez-faire policies of his day, particularly the proposition that a normally functioning market economy would bring full employment. Keynes's forward-looking work transformed economics from merely a descriptive and analytic discipline into one that is policy oriented. For Keynes, enlightened government intervention in a nation's economic life was essential to curbing what he saw as the inherent inequalities and instabilities of unregulated capitalism.",1573921394,9781573921398),Paperback,,403 pages,"

","It's 1986. Ronald Reagan is in the White House, Molly Ringwald is on the cover of Time and 29-year-old Michael Gregoretti is a struggling, underpaid copywriter at a big New York ad agency. He'd rather be writing plays; instead, he's writing awful commercials for a moisturizer formulated to conquer that dire, life-threatening condition: handruff.Michael reluctantly accepts an assignment on a brand-new (and very secret) product – an aerosol butter – hoping it will lead to the kind of work that will land him a better job at another agency. But there's a catch: Working on this new account will also mean working for the rigid, compulsive and quite possibly insane Gwen Hammond, who thinks that Michael, with his off-the-wall ideas and unconventional campaigns, is just too much of a rebel to work with such a conservative client.To further complicate life, Michael meets and falls for Craig Connolly, an absolute dreamboat from the South with a voice like FM radio and a face to match. Craig claims he'd like to be in a relationship and Michael wants to believe it. The problem is, Craig is already married – to his job.Michael survives it all with the help of his two best friends: Irene Lucca, a witty book editor with a flair for vintage clothing and an eye for the art director Michael works with, and Anthony DeLorenzo, Michael's wise (and wisecracking) roommate and staunchest supporter.By the time A Fool Among Fools ends, Michael has battled stuffy clients and stifling supervisors, written and produced what just might be the worst commercials in the history of advertising, found and lost love, and managed to keep himself – and the reader – laughing along the way.",,,ebook,,375 pages,"

","Stephen Hawking has dazzled readers worldwide with a string of bestsellers exploring the mysteries of the universe. Now, for the first time, perhaps the most brilliant cosmologist of our age turns his gaze inward for a revealing look at his own life and intellectual evolution.My Brief History recounts Stephen Hawking’s improbable journey, from his postwar London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity. Lavishly illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty, and candid account introduces readers to a Hawking rarely glimpsed in previous books: the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him Einstein; the jokester who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a particular black hole; and the young husband and father struggling to gain a foothold in the world of physics and cosmology.Writing with characteristic humility and humor, Hawking opens up about the challenges that confronted him following his diagnosis of ALS at age twenty-one. Tracing his development as a thinker, he explains how the prospect of an early death urged him onward through numerous intellectual breakthroughs, and talks about the genesis of his masterpiece A Brief History of Time—one of the iconic books of the twentieth century.Clear-eyed, intimate, and wise, My Brief History opens a window for the rest of us into Hawking’s personal cosmos.",0345535286,9780345535283),Hardcover,,126 pages,"

","Following a near-fatal accident, Mark Schluter is nursed by his reluctant sister. But when he emerges from his coma, Mark believes that this woman – who looks, acts, and sounds just like his sister – is really an identical impostor. As a famous neurologist investigates his condition, Mark tries to learn what really happened the night of his accident.On a winter night on a remote Nebraska road, 27-year-old Mark Schluter flips his truck in a near-fatal accident. His older sister Karin, his only near kin, returns reluctantly to their hometown to nurse Mark back from a traumatic head injury. But when he emerges from a protracted coma, Mark believes that this woman – who looks, acts, and sounds just like his sister – is really an identical impostor. Shattered by her brother’s refusal to recognize her, Karin contacts the cognitive neurologist Gerald Weber, famous for his case histories describing the infinitely bizarre worlds of brain disorder. Weber recognizes Mark as a rare case of Capgras Syndrome, a doubling delusion, and eagerly investigates. What he discovers in Mark slowly undermines even his own sense of being. Meanwhile, Mark, armed only with a note left by an anonymous witness, attempts to learn what happened the night of his inexplicable accident. The truth of that evening will change the lives of all three beyond recognition. Set against the Platte River’s massive spring migrations – one of the greatest spectacles in nature – The Echo Maker is a gripping mystery that explores the improvised human self and the even more precarious brain that splits us from and joins us to the rest of creation.",0374146357,9780374146351),Hardcover,,451 pages,"

Dr. Michael Newton, a hypnotherapist in private practice, has developed his own hypnosis technique to reach his subjects' hidden memories of the hereafter. The resulting narrative acts as a progressive ""travel log"" of the accounts of twenty-nine people who were placed in a state of superconsciousness. While in deep hypnosis, these subjects movingly describe what has happened to them between their former reincarnations on earth. They reveal graphic details about how it feels to die, who meets us right after death, what the spirit world is really like, where we go and what we do as souls, and why we choose to come back in certain bodies.",1567184855,9781567184853),Paperback,,278 pages,"

Far-reaching in scope and imagination, Lord of Snow and Shadows embarks on a journey like no other—into a shape-shifting world teeming with political intrigue, astonishing magic, and passions both dark and light.Raised by his protective mother in the sunny clime of the south, Gavril Andar knows nothing of his father—or the ominous legacy that awaits him. But his innocence is about to be shattered. The man who ruled the wintry kingdom of Azhkendir, a man infused with the burning blood of the dragon-warrior known as Drakhaoul, has been murdered by his enemies. It is his fiery, chameleonlike blood that pulses through Gavril’s veins. The news is Gavril’s first taste of death—but it will not be his last. For blood is the liquid that seals his fate.Expected by clan warriors from the north to avenge his father’s murder—and still his unquiet ghost—Gavril is kidnapped. He soon learns that becoming Drakhaon means not only ascending to the throne of Azhkendir but changing, in subtle ways at first, into a being of extraordinary power and might. A being that must be replenished with the blood of innocents in order to survive. Ensconced in Kastel Drakhaon with no means of escape from the icebound kingdom, and carefully watched by neighboring rulers waiting to move against him, the untested Gavril must fight to retain his human heart and soul in the face of impending war—and the dark instincts that threaten to overpower him.Man and beast, spymaster and insurgent, nature and the netherworld--all collide in phenomenal twists and turns. A masterwork of adventure fantasy, Lord of Snow and Shadows will leave you stunned—and longing for more.",0553586211,9780553586213),Paperback,,574 pages,"

","Beautiful, wild-child Nicole Tepper is hit by a car and left for dead. But when she wakes the next morning, Nicole finds herself in bed without a scratch. Perhaps she was more intoxicated than usual, as her mother is giving her the silent treatment and her friends are ignoring her as well. Things take a turn for the weird when Nicole soon discovers she is actually hovering between life and death. Her body is lying in the forest while her spirit is searching for anyone who can hear her. Unfortunately the only person who can is Dale Finnigan, the guy she publicly humiliated with a sharp-tongued insult that has left him branded. Desperate, Nicole has no choice but to haunt Dale and convince the freaked-out senior to help her. Will he find her body before it's too late? Or will the guy who tried to kill her with his car, beat him there and finish her off before anyone finds out?",1479165913,9781479165919),Paperback,,203 pages,"

After the publication of Satan in the Suburbs, his first book of short stories, Russell quipped: ""I have devoted my first eighty years of my life to philosophy, and propose to devote the next eighty years to another branch of fiction."" Also included here, for the first time, is the novella The Perplexities of John Forstice, along with Russell's intimate anecdotes and the fables created for the amusement of his own children. With the elegance and lucidity of stile that won him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, this volume gives a sparkling demonstration of Russell's humanity, his sense of fun, and his delighted perception of absurdity.",0671214896,9780671214890),Unknown Binding,,,"

","Purification is one of the prominent features of Islam. It means thorough purity and cleanliness of body, clothes, place and all aspects of Muslim's life. ‘Book of Purification’ contains information on purity of water, types of impurities, ways of purification, Menstruation, Ghusl, Tayammum, Wudu etc. It is part of the “Encyclopedia of Islamic Jurisprudence Concerning Muslim Women” series written by Yusuf Al-Hajj Ahmad. This series addresses those matters of life and religion that are essential in facilitating a woman’s role as a mother, teacher and nurturer. Men can also read and benefit from this particular book because the information in this book is relevant to both males and females. It has two very important and distinct qualities: 1.	Easy to read, succinct and direct. 2.	The 'question and answer' layout of the book is intended to facilitate effortless comprehensibility and swift memorization. It is in view of the 'questions and answers' format that the author has concluded this book to be easy to read and comprehensive, hoping that it will enable the Muslims to be well informed about matters concerning their religion which will in turn strengthen their faith.",,,ebook,,115 pages,"

But as war engulfs Sarajevo, Zlata Filipovic becomes a witness to food shortages and the deaths of friends and learns to wait out bombardments in a neighbor’s cellar.

","Shipwrecked and cast ashore in Japan with no memory of Temeraire or his own experiences as an English aviator, Laurence finds himself tangled in deadly political intrigues that threaten not only his own life but England’s already precarious position in the Far East. Age-old enmities and suspicions have turned the entire region into a powder keg ready to erupt at the slightest spark—a spark that Laurence and Temeraire may unwittingly provide, leaving Britain faced with new enemies just when they most desperately need allies instead.For to the west, another, wider conflagration looms. Napoleon has turned on his former ally, the emperor Alexander of Russia, and is even now leading the largest army the world has ever seen to add that country to his list of conquests. It is there, outside the gates of Moscow, that a reunited Laurence and Temeraire—along with some unexpected allies and old friends—will face their ultimate challenge...and learn whether or not there are stronger ties than memory.Naomi Novik’s beloved Temeraire series, a brilliant combination of fantasy and history that reimagines the Napoleonic wars as fought with the aid of intelligent dragons, is a twenty-first-century classic. From the first volume, His Majesty’s Dragon, readers have been entranced by the globe-spanning adventures of the resolute Capt. William Laurence and his brave but impulsive dragon, Temeraire. Now, in Blood of Tyrants, the penultimate volume of the series, Novik is at the very height of her powers as she brings her story to its widest, most colorful canvas yet.",0345522893,9780345522894),Hardcover,,432 pages,"

An eclectic group of neighbors and friends slowly gathers around the house, and Miles’s story is told from the points of view of four of them: Anna, a woman in her forties; Mark, a man in his sixties; May, a woman in her eighties; and a ten-year-old named Brooke. The thing is, none of these people knows Miles more than slightly. How much is it possible for us to know about a stranger? And what are the consequences of even the most casual, fleeting moments we share every day with one another? Brilliantly audacious, disarmingly playful, and full of Smith’s trademark wit and puns, There but for the is a deft exploration of the human need for separation—from our pasts and from one another—and the redemptive possibilities for connection.

","""I am Martuk. Remember, it’s Martuk as in “too”. Or “two” with that hard “k” at the end. Martuk. The Holy. The audacity of it still makes me smile.""In a crowded Left Bank cafe, an immortal man sits, the phantoms crawling near, the heat of their whispers stinging his cheek …and Martuk ... The Holy begins. One thousand years before the birth of Christ, a golden god damns Martuk with a kiss. In a land ruled by a wounded king, life everlasting steals his mortality from the bottom of a golden cup. Finally, generations later, a Messiah who has the power to heal breaks under the weight of Martuk's demons, stumbling to his death defeated by darkness. From his home in modern Paris, he writes, his memories lush, his words evocative. Revisiting his impossible life, he vents his rage and shares his loneliness. From bloody battles with a demon he cannot escape to the ghost of a beauty who haunts him still, this is his story.This is Martuk ... The Holy.",,,Kindle Edition,,287 pages,"

",كتب سعد الدوسري هذه الرواية قبل عشرين سنة، وهي تلامس الواقعة الاجتماعية بتفاصيلها. غير أن سعداً لم يجرؤ على نشر الرواية، ومثله كان كل أصدقائه الذين تناوبوا التناصح معه في عدم نشرها. ولقد شاعت الرواية بين الأيدي، بالتصوير والتهادي، حتى لقد صارت أشهر رواية عربية غير منشورة.ولو نُشرت في حينها، لأحدثت ضجة كبيرة ومدوّية، لأنها كانت فعلاً أول رواية سعودية تغوص في العمق وتضع اليد على الممنوع والمسكوت عنه.د. عبدالله الغذامي,,,,,416 pages,"

","Long ago, in the Second Age of history, a young Nain explorer by the name of Ven Polypheme traveled much of the known and unknown world, recording his adventures. Recently discovered by archaeologists, a few fragments of his original journals are reproduced in this book. Great care has been taken to reconstruct the parts of the journal that did not survive, so that a whole story can be told...Charles Magnus Ven Polypheme--known as Ven--is the youngest son of a long line of famous shipwrights. He dreams not of building ships, but of sailing them to far-off lands where magic thrives. Ven gets his chance when he is chosen to direct the Inspection of his family's latest ship--and sets sail on the journey of a lifetime. Attacked by fire pirates, lost at sea and near death, Ven is rescued by a passing ship on its way to the Island of Serendair. Thankful to be alive, little does Ven know that the pirate attack--and his subsequent rescue--may not have been an accident. Shadowy figures are hunting for the famed Floating Island, the only source of the mystical Water of Life. They think Ven can lead them to this treasure, and will stop at nothing to get it--even murder. In a narrative that alternates entries from his journals and drawings from his sketchbooks, Ven begins the famous chronicles of his exciting and exotic adventures--adventures that would later earn him renown as the author of The Book of All Human Knowledge and All the World's Magic.

The incredible story of the young women of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, who unwittingly played a crucial role in one of the most significant moments in U.S. history.
The Tennessee town of Oak Ridge was created from scratch in 1942. One of the Manhattan Project’s secret cities, it didn’t appear on any maps until 1949, and yet at the height of World War II it was using more electricity than New York City and was home to more than 75,000 people, many of them young women recruited from small towns across the South. Their jobs were shrouded in mystery, but they were buoyed by a sense of shared purpose, close friendships—and a surplus of handsome scientists and Army men!But against this vibrant wartime backdrop, a darker story was unfolding. The penalty for talking about their work—even the most innocuous details—was job loss and eviction. One woman was recruited to spy on her coworkers. They all knew something big was happening at Oak Ridge, but few could piece together the true nature of their work until the bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and the secret was out. The shocking revelation: the residents of Oak Ridge were enriching uranium for the atomic bomb.Though the young women originally believed they would leave Oak Ridge after the war, many met husbands there, made lifelong friends, and still call the seventy-year-old town home. The reverberations from their work there—work they didn’t fully understand at the time—are still being felt today. In The Girls of Atomic City, Denise Kiernan traces the astonishing story of these unsung WWII workers through interviews with dozens of surviving women and other Oak Ridge residents. Like The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, this is history and science made fresh and vibrant—a beautifully told, deeply researched story that unfolds in a suspenseful and exciting way.",1451617526,9781451617528),Hardcover,,373 pages,"

","In this meticulously researched and masterfully written book, Pulitzer Prize-winner Deborah Blum examines the history of love through the lens of its strangest unsung hero: a brilliant, fearless, alcoholic psychologist named Harry Frederick Harlow. Pursuing the idea that human affection could be understood, studied, even measured, Harlow (1905-1981) arrived at his conclusions by conducting research-sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrible-on the primates in his University of Wisconsin laboratory. Paradoxically, his darkest experiments may have the brightest legacy, for by studying ""neglect"" and its life-altering consequences, Harlow confirmed love's central role in shaping not only how we feel but also how we think. His work sparked a psychological revolution. The more children experience affection, he discovered, the more curious they become about the world: Love makes people smarter. The biography of both a man and an idea, The Measure of Love is a powerful and at times disturbing narrative that will forever alter our understanding of human relationships.",0738202789,9780738202785),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

Overcome with guilt and unable to cope with the loss of her beloved family, she has long since buried eight-year old Aubrey along with them and transformed herself into Raven Miller. Now with jet-black hair, multiple sets of eccentric contact lenses, and several facial piercings, she's veiled herself in complete darkness as a form of protection for herself, as well as others. As she enters her first year of college, her goal is simple: Earn a degree with the least amount of social interaction as possible. What she never anticipates is the formation of very unlikely relationships with two people who will change her life in ways she never believed possible: Quinn Matthews, the overtly cheerful pageant queen, and Kaeleb McMadden, a childhood friend who never really let her go. Over the years, as their connections intertwine and strengthen, a seemingly indestructible bond is formed between the three. And eventually, the ties of friendship and discovery of first love begin to coax her from her darkened path as they slowly bring Aubrey back to life. But when faced with the possibility of yet another death, one from which she may never recover, Aubrey finds herself lost again, burying herself deeper than ever before beneath the familiar abyss of her fears. Spanning the course of four years, this is the story of a young woman's plight to finally reemerge, finding strength within unbreakable bonds as she delivers herself from her own manufactured darkness and safely back . . . Into the Light.",,,Kindle Edition,,311 pages,"

","Vincent Spinetti is an archetypal tortured artist ? a sensitive young writer who falls victim to alienation, parental neglect, poverty, depression, alcoholism, illness, nervous breakdowns, and unrequited love. He is painfully unaware that these torments are due to the secret manipulations of New Renaissance, an experimental organization that is testing the age-old idea that art results from suffering. Since culture is so significantly influenced by music, movies, and television, New Renaissance hopes to improve the mindless mainstream by raising writers who emphasize artistic quality over commerce. As part of its top-secret sub-project, New Renaissance hires reluctant ex-musician Harlan Eiffler to manipulate its most promising prodigy, Vincent. Wickedly antisocial and deeply disgusted by what passes for entertainment in the twenty-first century, Harlan clandestinely pulls the strings so that Vincent remains a true artist. All the while, he poses as Vincent's manager, simultaneously nurturing his prolific career and torturing his soul.",159692148X,9781596921481),Paperback,,265 pages,"

","Once rumored to have been the inspiration for Ian Fleming's Miss Moneypenny, Vera Atkins climbed her way to the top in the Special Operations Executive, or SOE: Britain's secret service created to help build up, organize, and arm the resistance in the Nazi-occupied countries. Throughout the war, Atkins recruited, trained, and mentored the agents for the SOE's French Section, which sent more than four hundred young men and women into occupied France, at least one hundred of whom never returned and were reported MPD (missing presumed dead) after the war. Twelve of these were women and among Atkins' most cherished spies. When the war ended in 1945, she made it her personal mission to find out what happened to them and the other agents lost behind enemy lines, tracing rigorously their horrific final journeys. But as the woman who carried out this astonishing search appeared quintessentially English, Atkins was nothing of the sort. As we follow her through the devastation of postwar Germany, we learn Atkins herself covered her life in mystery so that even her closest family knew almost nothing of her past.In A Life in Secrets Sarah Helm has stripped away Vera Atkins' many veils. Drawing on recently released sixty-year-old government files and her unprecedented access to the private papers of the Atkins family, Helm vividly reconstructs a complex and extraordinary life.",038550845X,9780385508452),Hardcover,,528 pages,"

","‘Dina Lal wasn’t moving . . . Hindu or not, he wasn’t, goddamnit, going anywhere.’ Lahore, 1947. Dina Lal, a true-blue Lahori, refuses to leave, staying put in Five Queen’s Road, a house he bought, in spite of his wife’s greatest misgivings, from an Englishman who was deeply reluctant to part with it. To insulate his family from the mayhem on the streets, Dina Lal converts to Islam and as added protection invites Amir Shah, a Muslim colleague, and his children, Javid and Rubina, to share the house with him. But the events that unfold over the next few months make a mockery of Dina Lal’s plans. While Dina Lal and Amir Shah cross swords with each other at every given opportunity—though unexpectedly and in spite of themselves rushing to the other’s defence in moments of crisis—a furtive friendship blossoms between Dina Lal and Javid. Ten years later Javid’s European wife, Irene, still struggling with her World War II memories, joins the tumultuous household. Inexplicably, the lines of the house are redrawn, and the new border is no less arbitrary and contentious than the one that sundered the subcontinent. While the house is steadily encroached upon by a car shop settlement and a sweepers’ colony, the occupants’ long-standing feud reaches new heights. But the family sees an unexpected alliance develop and loyalties, to person and nation, are scrutinized. In this stunning novel that weaves family saga and national history, Sorayya Khan writes deftly of characters who battle memories and each other alike.",0143064185,9780143064183),Paperback,,224 pages,"

She never thought that before rallying an empire, she'd have to fight the emperor himself.An imposter sits the throne and the court she turned to for help is in turmoil. Ciardis hasn't survived assassination attempts, torture and really bad luck to be taken down by her own ruler. So she devises a plan. But first she needs to get Sebastian and Thanar to agree. Each seems to love her in their own way. But neither is listening to her. Pushing them to put aside their differences, in an effort to ward off catastrophe, might be harder than displacing an emperor who would do anything to keep his throne.Butting heads at court isn’t Ciardis’s only problem. With the princess heir’s threat looming she is forced to travel to the mythical city of Kifar, where it is up to her small group to stop the destruction of the entire city while heading a rebellion that could foment a revolution. It wouldn't be the first revolution that Algardis has ever known. But with Ciardis Weathervane at its head—it would certainly be the last.This fifth novel continues the story of Ciardis Weathervane from Sworn To Secrecy.",,,,,,,"['Fantasy', 'Young Adult', 'Romance']"

Hallie dreamed of escaping her hometown and never looking back. After putting herself through college, landing her dream job in Chicago, and starting a romance with her handsome running partner Bo Pompillio, life is finally exactly as she wants it. That is, until she’s transferred back to the hometown. Not wanting her past to cross paths with her future, Hallie puts her relationship with Bo on hold. When she arrives in town, Hallie finds crazy Aunt Grace rummaging through a dumpster looking for the “perfect” welcome home gift for her niece. That’s just the beginning. After that, Aunt Grace stays busy by dying her stolen poodle’s hair pink and leaving the dog on her apartment roof to pee, throwing bricks out the window at passing neighbors, and climbing every flag pole to kiss the ornamental eagle. Hallie finds some sanity at a local jewelry-making class where she uncovers a hidden talent for beading. When her talent is discovered by a major department store jewelry buyer, Hallie realizes that what she had in Chicago might not have been her dream life after all. When faced with the choice of moving back to Chicago and Bo or taking a leap of faith to start her own jewelry company (with Aunt Grace in tow), Hallie has to make a decision.

","A tale of high adventure and lyrical celebration, tenderness and violence, generosity and ruthlessness, Memed, My Hawk is the defining achievement of one of the greatest and most beloved of living writers, Yashar Kemal. It is reissued here with a new introduction by the author on the fiftieth anniversary of its first publication.Memed, a high-spirited, kindhearted boy, grows up in a desperately poor mountain village whose inhabitants are kept in virtual slavery by the local landlord. Determined to escape from the life of toil and humiliation to which he has been born, he flees but is caught, tortured, and nearly killed. When at last he does get away, it is to set up as a roving brigand, celebrated in song, who could be a liberator to his people—unless, like the thistles that cover the mountain slopes of his native region, his character has taken an irremediably harsh and unforgiving form.",159017139X,9781590171394),Paperback,,392 pages,"

","Jordan has visions of monsters, demons, and death. Seventeen, orphaned, and born into the family business, she doesn’t have friends, she doesn’t have choices. Her uncle, older brothers, and a few annoying angels dominate her life, demanding she tow their lines – and the punishment is severe when those lines are crossed. When Jordan is ordered to help hunt down a monster, she’s not sure which she dreads more: the elusive, blood-thirsty creature or spending time in a cramped backwoods cabin with a brother who despises her. To make matters worse, a demon shows up and warns Jordan that she could be her family’s next assignment.In a game between Good and Evil where God seems to have tapped out early, lines are blurred and not everything is as it seems. Jordan learns a little too late that the real monster is closer than she thinks.",,,Kindle Edition,Second Edition,264 pages,"

","Velveteen Monroe is dead. At 16, she was kidnapped and murdered by a madman named Bonesaw. But that’s not the problem.The problem is she landed in purgatory. And while it’s not a fiery inferno, it’s certainly no heaven. It’s gray, ashen, and crumbling more and more by the day, and everyone has a job to do. Which doesn’t leave Velveteen much time to do anything about what’s really on her mind.Bonesaw.Velveteen aches to deliver the bloody punishment her killer deserves. And she’s figured out just how to do it. She’ll haunt him for the rest of his days. It’ll be brutal... and awesome.But crossing the divide between the living and the dead has devastating consequences. Velveteen’s obsessive haunting cracks the foundations of purgatory and jeopardizes her very soul. A risk she’s willing to take—except fate has just given her reason to stick around: an unreasonably hot and completely off-limits coworker.Velveteen can’t help herself when it comes to breaking rules... or getting revenge.

Even though the relationship is clearly over, Melissa clings to the past, riding a never-ending wave of hope and disappointment. Meaningless sexual escapades, drunken nights, and drug-induced blackouts help her deal with heartbreak, but her pain goes much deeper than her failed relationship. Along with a broken heart, Melissa has to cope with the memories of her younger brother’s death; the non-existent parenting of her insecure, flighty mother; being juggled between social workers and psychologists; and getting kicked out of school and sent to a special program for at-risk youth. So when the cracks in her life threaten to tear her apart, Melissa has to decide whether to keep fighting—or to let go.",0143173936,9780143173939),Paperback,,263 pages,"

","A new trilogy by best-selling author of Amish Christian Romances, Sarah Price, and Whoopie Pie Pam Jarrell. The first book immediately hit #1 in the Amish genre as well as an Amazon Top 100 within days.  In Book 2 of the series, readers will continue following the story of four Amish sisters who run Whoopie Pie Place, the best known bakery outside of Berlin, Ohio. Each sister has a secret that influences their lives and, unknowingly, impacts each other. Yet, little by little, the pressure of balancing their responsibilities of their daily lives with their individual secrets becomes harder to manage. Leah, Susan, Lydia, and Sadie need to decide whether or not to confide in each other in order to gain the support of their family. As secrets begin to be revealed, more problems ensue. Can Leah continue to hold the family together? Will Susie address her issues at home? Will Lydia admit what everyone else knows? How can Sadie maintain her balance when faced with life-changing decisions?  The Divine Secrets of the Whoopie Pie Sisters is a different type of Amish Christian story. By blending the 25 years experience of living among the Amish from Sarah Price with Pamela Jarrell's extensive 15 years experience interacting and befriending the Amish in Berlin, Ohio, Price and Jarrell team up to give the readers a new type of story that focuses not so much on romance but on friendships and the reality of day-to-day life living among the Amish. Book Three is scheduled to be released January 31, 2014. Preorder it now.",,,Kindle Edition,,125 pages,"

","Dorothy Parker, master of the short story, dramatist, screenwriter, and sharp-tongued critic, was also an accomplished poet. At the center of the famed Round Table at New York's Algonquin Hotel, Parker distinguished herself among a circle of urbane literati with her excoriating quips and wonderfully realized epigrammatic poems. By the time her first collection of poems, Enough Rope, was published in 1926, she had been dubbed the ""wittiest woman in America"".Confronting the hard facts of existence facing a woman of talent and boldness in the 1920s and '30s, Parker's poems depict a world haunted by unrequited love, alcohol, razor blades, and men of overbearing will. Her poetry earned much admiration from critics such as Odgen Nash, Somerset Maugham, and Edmund Wilson, who hailed it as ""flatly brutal as the wit of the age of Pope"". Complete Poems collects Parker's three volumes of poetry, Enough Rope, Sunset Gun, and Death and Taxes, as well as a hundred other previously uncollected works -- such as the ""hate songs"", compact satiric descriptions of husbands and wives, actors and politicians, bores and ne'er-do-wells, and others who attracted her barbed pen.",0141180226,9780141180229),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A Creative Tension is a fresh look at the foreign policy roles of Congress and the president by one of the most astute congressional practitioners of foreign policy of recent decades, former U.S. representative and chairman of the House International Relations Committee Lee H. Hamilton. With an insider's perspective based on thirty-four years in Congress, Hamilton elucidates current domestic and international pressures influencing U.S. foreign policy, strengths and weaknesses in the foreign policy process, and ways to improve the performance of the president and Congress. A Creative Tension argues persuasively and elegantly that better consultation between the executive and legislative branches is the most effective way to strengthen American foreign policy.A Creative Tension is the most extensive analysis of the congressional and presidential roles in foreign policy by a former member of Congress. Hamilton explores the topic in an original, stimulating, and accessible manner by deftly mixing incisive commentary with illuminating personal reflections. The book includes timely and important recommendations for improving the ability of Congress and the president to develop a foreign policy that meets the challenges and opportunities of a post-September 11 world. It should be of interest to foreign policy makers, scholars and students of American politics, and the general public.Wilson Forum",1930365128,9781930365124),Paperback,,108 pages,"

An attempted gay-bashing of a crippled war vet leads to a scream-of-consciousness unraveling of a terrifying past and the ultimate discovery of a new human possibility. After its publication in the February 2006 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction several subscribers actually cancelled their subscriptions in protest. This story is an unflinching look at souls in transformation. Contains strong language and vivid descriptions of sex and violence. Not recommended for young or impressionable readers.

She is constantly tormented by the guilt of being the only one left to care for her mother, who has suffered through unimaginable trauma in the past - both emotional and physical. The possibility of finding love has also become a distant fantasy for Gabby, not likely to come true any time soon either, until she meets Benjamin Martin - a handsome, charismatic, intelligent, successful, funny, and so very tasty (quite literally and figuratively speaking) man - who owns the Caribbean restaurant next door to her office. He is the kind of guy that seems too good to be true.

But when Maximillian Solomon asks him about The Temple of the Last Days he figures his luck might be about to change. In 1975 the cult led by its infamous leader Sister Katherine met a bloody end in the Arizona desert. The shoot’s locations take Kyle to the cult’s original bases in London, France and finally the crime scene where the cult met their bloody end. But when he interviews the remaining survivors of the Last Days who haven’t broken silence in decades, a series of uncanny events and unexplained phenomena plague the shoots. And what exactly is it they are managing to record in any place the Temple once resided? Troubling out-of-body experiences and nocturnal visitations, the sudden demise of their interviewees and the discovery of ghastly artefacts, soon pitch Kyle and his one-man crew, into the unnerving realisation that they have become entangled in the cult’s hideous legacy.",,,Kindle Edition,,542 pages,"

For the first time ever, an explosive inside look at modern military police units and their role in defending our freedomAmerica has been at war on several fronts since the 9/11 attack. While public attention has focused on Marines, conventional Army units, and Special Operations Forces, a lion’s share of the war-fighting has been done, under media radar, by Military Police units. These squad and platoon-sized units patrol dangerous urban streets, build up local police units to improve neighborhood stability, and conduct civic action missions. On many occasions they have rushed into a vicious firefight to come to the assistance of infantry units in desperate straits. They keep villages Taliban-free, monitor balloting sites, and interdict drug shipments. In detention centers at Camp Bucha, Iraq, Bagram, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo, Cuba they guard some of the most dangerous terrorists in history.The story is told by the soldiers themselves, recounting what they have seen and experienced, along with historical context and first-hand field observations by the author team who were provided with unique inside access. Warrior Police takes readers into the bloody streets of Iraq, the dangerous back-country of Afghanistan, and wherever our Military Police are needed.

Without a formal accusation or trial, the onetime national hero was imprisoned on Buru for eleven years. He survived under brutal conditions, somehow managing to produce his masterwork, the four novels of the Buru Quartet, as well as the remarkable journal entries, essays, and Letters that comprise this moving memoir.Reminiscent of the work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, The Mute's Soliloquy is a harrowing portrait of a penal colony and a heartbreaking remembrance of life before it. With a resonance far beyond its particular time and place, it is Pramoedya's crowning achievement -- a passionate tribute to the freedom of the mind and a celebration of the human spirit.",0140289046,9780140289046),Paperback,,400 pages,"

This continues until the entire package of letters goes full-circle, returning to the original sender.In Volume 1 of the 10 part series, Miriam's Letter, Miriam Fisher decides to start a circle letter among her children that no longer live at home.

","A ""brilliant, astonishing modern love story""* and an acclaimed literary debut...  A young Cuban woman passes her nights dancing in a seedy Florida strip club; a Russian orphan loses everything, then builds a new and prosperous life for himself in New York; a woman struggles to maintain her dignity and hope after a life-changing accident—these are the three members of the troika whose story is told in this dazzling literary debut. Their lives unexpectedly intertwined, Perla, Julian and Sophie discover a world—a way of life—that forces them to challenge their definitions of commitment, love and trust, a world that heals old wounds and inspires them to transform tragedy into beauty. “What a great gallop through the landscape of the human heart, what a brilliant, astonishing modern love story, what a beautiful pair of heroines, what an amazing journey from the plantains of Little Havana and a Fort Lauderdale strip club to Fifth Avenue and East Hampton, what a ride to a complex and satisfying redemption, what a glorious testimony to the way damage can become a lovely destiny, what a book!”—*Susan Cheever ",039916748X,9780399167485),Hardcover,,288 pages,"

Punto culminante de la primera etapa estética de Lorca, el propio poeta lo define como el poema de Andalucía, y lo llamo gitano porque el gitano es lo más elevado, lo más profundo, más aristocrático de mi país, lo más representativo de su modo y el que guarda la sangre y el alfabeto de la verdad andaluza y universal. Es, sin embargo, un libro donde apenas sí está expresada la Andalucía que se ve, pero donde está temblando la que no se ve: un libro antipintoresco, antifolclórico, antiflamenco..., donde las figuras sirven a fondos milenarios y donde no hay más que un personaje grande y oscuro como un cielo de estío... la pena.",,,Paperback,,149 pages,"

","As another college year draws to an end, Professor Michael Branden is weary after nearly thirty years of teaching. Sitting in his office on a warm spring day, he receives an unexpected visit from an Amish man who claims his brother, a dwarf like himself, has been murdered. Their discussion of the odd details of the case is interrupted by a commotion on campus, which turns out to be the apparent suicide of a young woman, who, it seems, has leapt to her death from the college bell tower.The investigations of these two deaths become intertwined as Professor Branden again teams up with his colleagues Pastor Cal Troyer and Sheriff Bruce Robertson to seek explanations for these bizarre events.Separate from the World is a story of a rift between two Amish factions, one that favors the use of medicine and that participates in a college study of genetic traits particular to the Amish community, and the other that rejects any outside influence.Once more, P. L. Gaus takes us inside a separate culture and, in a manner both gentle and grim, highlights the complex relationship of the Amish and the “English” as they live inside or outside each other’s orbits.",,,Audiobook,,,"

","From his first appearance on a Vatican balcony Pope Francis proved himself a Pope of Surprises. With a series of potent gestures, history’s first Jesuit pope declared a mission to restore authenticity and integrity to a Catholic Church bedevilled by sex abuse and secrecy, intrigue and in-fighting, ambition and arrogance. He declared it should be 'a poor Church, for the poor'.But there is a hidden past to this modest man with the winning smile. Jorge Mario Bergoglio was previously a bitterly divisive figure. His decade as leader of Argentina’s Jesuits left the religious order deeply split. And his behaviour during Argentina’s Dirty War, when military death squads snatched innocent people from the streets, raised serious questions – on which this book casts new light.Yet something dramatic then happened to Jorge Mario Bergoglio. He underwent an extraordinary transformation. After a time of exile he re-emerged having turned from a conservative authoritarian into a humble friend of the poor – and became Bishop of the Slums, making enemies among Argentina’s political classes in the process. For Pope Francis – Untying the Knots, Paul Vallely travelled to Argentina and Rome to meet Bergoglio’s intimates over the last four decades. His book charts a remarkable journey. It reveals what changed the man who was to become Pope Francis – from a reactionary into the revolutionary who is unnerving Rome’s clerical careerists with the extent of his behind-the-scenes changes. In this perceptive portrait Paul Vallely offers both new evidence and penetrating insights into the kind of pope Francis could become.",1472903706,9781472903709),Paperback,,227 pages,"

","In the town of Bacherotto, remarkable forces of faith, sex, and hunger are driving the inhabitants into uncontrollable frenzies of bizarre and unexplained behaviors.  The baker Gianni Terremoto begins to knead his rolls and sourdough breads in the form of his lover's breasts. His lusty daughter, Francesca, is about to become enshrined as the new local saint.  His girlfriend Luigi Bacheretti is intent on photographing God.  The local priest is convinced that the Virgin Mary has appeared to him, demanding that his congregation renounce the flesh -- an imperative that comes shortly after two amputees stage a popular ballet recital that celebrates the leg.These extraordinary events occur in the year when Good Friday and April Fool's Day coincide.  Gainni, born on April Fool's Day Day, decides to bake a hot cross bun surpassing any that has ever been.  The results  -- hilarious, surprising, rejuvenating -- are beyond any that he and the townsfolk could have expected. A brilliant story of what happens when Easter and Carnival collide and when the community becomes controlled by its libido, The Breadmaker's Carnival defies both the sacred and profane.",1740935055,9781740935050),Audio CD,,,"

","Un matin, alors que Marie-Aile Paradis attend l’arrivée de la rame de métro, une femme élégante lui demande son nom avant de se fondre dans la foule. Quelques jours plus tard, la même personne à la sensualité troublante l’accoste de nouveau et, tout en lui offrant un de ses gants, lui murmure à l’oreille : « L’amour naît parfois dans la cruauté. »Intriguée par ces rencontres fortuites, envoûtée par le parfum qui se dégage du gant et encouragée par Yasmine, sa meilleure amie, Marie-Aile se lance à la recherche de la mystérieuse inconnue. Les seuls indices qu’elle possède : la marque du gant et l’inscription qui s’y trouve, K5566. Or, cette improbable quête va bouleverser la vie de Marie-Aile en obligeant la jeune femme à prendre conscience, à l’approche de son trentième anniversaire, que son existence, depuis une décennie, se résume à être la victime soumise d’un conjoint obsédé sexuel et l’esclave consentante d’un travail routinier.De façon inattendue, Marie-Aile obtient un nouvel emploi qui lui plaît. Toutefois, une série de lettres reçue de façon anonyme la plonge au cœur d’un nouveau mystère dont l’origine semble remonter à la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Alors même qu’elle tente de reprendre sa vie en main – son quotidien ressemble de plus en plus à un enfer –, Marie-Aile réalise qu’elle ne cesse d’être manipulée par les uns et les autres, et que son destin ne lui appartient peut-être plus...",,,Hardcover,,544 pages,"

","A Frozen Woman charts Ernaux's teenage awakening, and then the parallel progression of her desire to be desirable and her ambition to fulfill herself in her chosen profession - with the inevitable conflict between the two. And then she is thirty years old, a teacher married to an executive, mother of two infant sons. She looks after their nice apartment, raises her children. And yet, like millions of other women, she has felt her enthusiasm and curiosity, her strength and her happiness, slowly ebb under the weight of her daily routine. The very condition that everyone around her seems to consider normal and admirable for a woman is killing her. While each of Ernaux's books contain an autobiographical element, A Frozen Woman, one of Ernaux's early works, concentrates the spotlight piercingly on Annie herself. Mixing affection, rage and bitterness, A Frozen Woman shows us Ernaux's developing art when she still relied on traditional narrative, before the shortened form emerged that has since become her trademark.",188836338X,9781888363388),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","On a warm summer morning in Frayser, Tennessee, it is Rick and Winnie Dunce’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents aren't actually being wrapped nor are reservations really being made when Rick’s somewhat brilliant, yet borderline psychotic wife, vanishes. Husband-of-the-Year Rick isn’t doing himself any favors with troubling fantasies about opening up his wife’s skull (Hannibal Lecter style) or his wholly inappropriate joke at his missing wife's news conference. Passages from Winnie's diary expose just how completely out of her mind she really is. The super-annoying perfectionist with her inane treasure hunt clues and bizarre quiz questions could have put anyone precariously on edge. I mean, if he did kill her, can you really blame him?Under growing pressure from the cops and the media—as well as Winnie’s weird and selfishly preoccupied parents—the suspect/husband dispenses a continuous series of lies, deceptions, and inappropriate behavior. Rick is strangely evasive, kind of dumb and he’s certainly hostile—but is he really a killer?Formerly titled, So Far Gone Girl, this hilarious parody of GONE GIRL, the most intense and acclaimed thriller of the decade, will leave you doubled over with laughter, gasping for breath and checking to see if your own ottoman can really balance on its side like that.",,,ebook,,,"

","A terrorist’s plot, the assassination of a prime minister, holds the key to an apocalyptic plot to destroy Europe’s economy. It’s impossible to stop, but one man doesn’t know enough to think the world can’t be saved. He’s no hero; not clever or capable, talented or tested. The Hollow Man is just trying to survive in an uncertain climate where terrorism is changing the rules of how we live.The Hollow Man is a field analyst assigned to learn the new tactics of terror while trying to keep disaster from U.S. borders. If he fails and lets that happen, he lets down a world of people who didn’t even know he exists. Confronting his own demons along with soldiers of this new world, he is young, untrained and ill-prepared for what he finds.Based on true events, a young man running from Vietnam finds himself in another kind of war. A new war of terror is spreading across Europe. As a naive field analyst for a U.S. government agency, he is assigned to babysit the unpopular Prime Minister of Spain, Luis Carrero Blanco. It’s easy duty for a young unskilled analyst. But the quick assassination of Blanco by the ruthless terrorist, Chaban, sets off a chase across Spain and France to stop him before he can complete his plan to destroy the economy of Europe.Haunted by one of Chaban’s previous murder victims, a twelve year old girl, the analyst battles ruthless assassins and his own personal demons in a vicious struggle to save 5,000 innocent lives from becoming collateral damage in the terrorist’s psychotic plot. Disowned by the American government, no one can help him except Zita, MI6 agent and lover. They follow the trail from Madrid to Paris always a step behind.",,,ebook,2nd Edition,252 pages,"

","Robyn Schneider's The Beginning of Everything is a witty and heart-wrenching teen novel that will appeal to fans of books by John Green and Ned Vizzini, novels such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and classics like The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye.Varsity tennis captain Ezra Faulkner was supposed to be homecoming king, but that was before—before his girlfriend cheated on him, before a car accident shattered his leg, and before he fell in love with unpredictable new girl Cassidy Thorpe.As Kirkus Reviews said in a starred review, ""Schneider takes familiar stereotypes and infuses them with plenty of depth. Here are teens who could easily trade barbs and double entendres with the characters that fill John Green's novels.""Funny, smart, and including everything from flash mobs to blanket forts to a poodle who just might be the reincarnation of Jay Gatsby, The Beginning of Everything is a refreshing contemporary twist on the classic coming-of-age novel—a heart-wrenching story about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.",0062217143,9780062217141),Paperback,,335 pages,"

","With this outrageous new novel, China Miéville has written one of the strangest, funniest, and flat-out scariest books you will read this—or any other—year. The London that comes to life in Kraken is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about—or prevent—the End of All Things.In the Darwin Centre at London’s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre’s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux—better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy’s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens—human and otherwise—are adept in magic and murder.There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity—and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC—the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit—a branch of London’s finest that fights sorcery with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city’s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London’s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying—yet darkly charismatic—demonic duo.All of them—and others—are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be.",034549749X,9780345497499),Hardcover,,509 pages,"

Charles Jacobs, along with his beautiful wife, will transform the local church. The men and boys are all a bit in love with Mrs Jacobs; the women and girls – including Jamie’s mother and beloved sister – feel the same about Reverend Jacobs. With Jamie, the Reverend shares a deeper bond, based on their fascination with simple experiments in electricity.Then tragedy strikes the Jacobs family; the preacher curses God, mocking all religious belief, and is banished from the shocked town.Jamie has demons of his own. In his mid-thirties, he is living a nomadic lifestyle of bar-band rock and roll.

Their bond becomes a pact beyond even the Devil’s devising, and Jamie discovers that revival has many meanings.

What started out as a spellbinding miracle of biblical proportions has now turned into a manhunt for murder. Jack Waters, the town reporter, suspects him of foul play. Some say the stranger is a gift from God, while others believe he is the devil himself. Once Jack's only daughter is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he is confronted with a major decision. Does he sit back and watch his own flesh and blood waste away, or does he schedule an appointment with Gud. With authorities hot on Gud's trail, Jack soon becomes a new suspect in the case.

In De welwillenden worden de gruwelen van de Tweede Wereldoorlog beschreven vanuit het perspectief van de dader; dat gegeven, gecombineerd met een duizelingwekkende kennis van details, maakt dit boek tot een zeldzaam literair monument.",902956654X,9789029566544),Hardcover,,981 pages,"

A conversation overheard in the bathroom of Dionysus’s Bar about a jilted and lonely ""Greek god"" in need of a quick pick-me-up sounds like just what she’s looking for. But picking up the god of love for a one-night stand is easier said than done--especially when he's sworn off mortals forever.Eros has been down and out since his ex-wife left him, and falling for another mortal woman is the last thing he needs. Which means a maddening desire for the woman across the street is not in the cards. Thus begins his quest to find a match made in heaven for Annie. It's the perfect plan ... if only Eros can bear to let the girl of his dreams go.Can a woman looking for love, and a matchmaking god who wants her to find it—with someone else—have a shot at a happy ending, or will Eros's golden arrows miss their mark, for once?",1622669533,9781622669530),ebook,,291 pages,"

","Maybe it was the Shenanigans gift certificate that put her over the edge. When children's librarian and self-professed nice girl Jane Jameson is fired by her beastly boss and handed twenty-five dollars in potato skins instead of a severance check, she goes on a bender that's sure to become Half Moon Hollow legend. On her way home, she's mistaken for a deer, shot, and left for dead. And thanks to the mysterious stranger she met while chugging neon-colored cocktails, she wakes up with a decidedly unladylike thirst for blood. Jane is now the latest recipient of a gift basket from the Newly Undead Welcoming Committee, and her life-after-lifestyle is taking some getting used to. Her recently deceased favorite aunt is now her ghostly roommate. She has to fake breathing and endure daytime hours to avoid coming out of the coffin to her family. She's forced to forgo her favorite down-home Southern cooking for bags of O negative. Her relationship with her sexy, mercurial vampire sire keeps running hot and cold. And if all that wasn't enough, it looks like someone in Half Moon Hollow is trying to frame her for a series of vampire murders. What's a nice undead girl to do?",,,Kindle Edition,,384 pages,"

When bad-boy sculptor Steel rides up on his motorcycle looking to rent studio space, his infusion of cash is more than welcome.

Moving into her gallery basement is the first step; seducing the cool Southern belle into modeling for him is the second.As Steel peels away her careful manners and tasteful outfits, Althea begins to realize her life isn't just fine at all—it's as pale and washed-out as the watercolor paintings she's failing to sell.

But he can't figure out what killed her or why she had to die, and his efforts to sort out what's happened have been interrupted by his discovery of a series of elaborate and escalating threats hidden in strange places around his home—one buried in the sugar bag, another carved into the side of his television. These disturbing threats may be the best clues to his wife's death:CURL UP ON MY LAP. LET ME BRUSH YOUR HAIR WITH MY FINGERS. I AM SINGING YOU A LULLABY. I AM TESTING FOR STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN YOUR SKULL.Detective Chico is also on the case, and is intent on asking David questions he doesn't know the answers to and introducing him to people who don't appear to have David's or his wife's best interests in mind.

","Millions of Christians have struggled with how to reconcile God's love and God's judgment: Has God created billions of people over thousands of years only to select a few to go to heaven and everyone else to suffer forever in hell? Is this acceptable to God? How is this ""good news""?Troubling questions—so troubling that many have lost their faith because of them. Others only whisper the questions to themselves, fearing or being taught that they might lose their faith and their church if they ask them out loud. But what if these questions trouble us for good reason? What if the story of heaven and hell we have been taught is not, in fact, what the Bible teaches? What if what Jesus meant by heaven, hell, and salvation are very different from how we have come to understand them? What if it is God who wants us to face these questions?Author, pastor, and innovative teacher Rob Bell presents a deeply biblical vision for rediscovering a richer, grander, truer, and more spiritually satisfying way of understanding heaven, hell, God, Jesus, salvation, and repentance. The result is the discovery that the ""good news"" is much, much better than we ever imagined.",0062109138,9780062109132),Audio CD,,4 pages,"

","Karpal Singh is widely regarded as Malaysia’s best criminal and constitutional lawyer. His sudden death on 17 April 2014 in a horrific car accident – just a month after he was convicted of sedition in the High Court – shocked and saddened Malaysians to the core and left a deep void in the country’s legal and political landscape. Karpal was a fearless advocate for justice and a defender of human rights in South East Asia, and has appeared in the Privy Council in London on a number of occasions before such appeals were abandoned by Malaysia. He is renowned for his defence of many people from many nations who have faced the death penalty under Malaysia's Dangerous Drugs Act. In recent years, one of his biggest achievements was his successful defence of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on two charges of sodomy in 2012. On the night he died, Karpal was still fighting for Anwar, who had been convicted once again of sodomy, and seeking to reassure him. He told the Opposition leader in a telephone call he would do his best in the prosecution’s ‘fast-tracked’ Federal Court of Appeal. Indeed Karpal had Anwar’s files with him in his vehicle when the fateful crash occurred.In this revised and updated edition, veteran journalist Tim Donoghue completes the biography of Malaysia’s tenacious and principled lawyer-politician.",9814408530,9789814408530),Paperback,Marshal Cavendish Edition,325 pages,"

In spite of his superiors’ concerns that he is not up to the challenge, his unique mental abilities have proven essential to the defense of the United Planets in its fight against the Titan invaders. Serving on the first FTL prototype, the Intrepid, on its maiden voyage to Tau-Ceti, Gallant finds a lost human colony on the planet Elysium. Elysium’s leader, Cyrus Wolfe, has allied himself with an ancient Artificial Intelligence which had lain dormant on the planet for millennia, but is now willing to protect the colonists against the Titans. Gallant allies himself with Alaina Hepburn, the leader of the democratic opposition. With Alaina’s help, he discovers that the ancient AI has a sinister ulterior motive and he must match his exceptional mind against the complexity of machine intelligence to escape the ultimate trap and prevent the extermination of humanity. In Lieutenant Henry Gallant, one man pits the naked human mind against the perspicacity of machine intelligence.",,,Kindle Edition,1.00,312 pages,"

","They are beautiful. They are rich. They are strong willed and successful. They have everything, but love. And each one of them has a dark secret looming in their past.Sophia is a 25 year old Brazilian widow. Intelligent and ravishing, she flees from her own country after a tragic incident. Hiding from everyone and everything, she remains alone, torn between the love for a dead man, the torment of living without part of her memory and the fear of moving on. Ethan is one of the most important tycoons in the steel industry. As the memory of an awful evening in his adolescence haunts him night and day, he keeps looking for an elusive woman whom he could love - and who would love him - as he never has in all his 35 years... Until he finds Sophia. Alistair is a 34 year old powerful banker, searching for one–night stands with women who will warm his bed. And that he can punish physically to abate his anger for his late wife's black deeds and his own guilt for being such a debauched man for so many years. Any woman will do, and he has many to choose from, as they all fall instantly for his manly, devilish charming ways.In Europe, in the months after October 2009, their paths will cross and clash.This is the first installment of the TRUST series.

In 1946, an alien virus that rewrites human DNA was accidentally unleashed in the skies over New York City. It killed ninety percent of those it infected. Nine percent survived, mutated into tragically deformed creatures. And one percent gained superpowers. The Wild Cards shared-universe series, created and edited by New York Times #1 bestseller George R. R. Martin (called “the American Tolkien” by Time), is the tale of the history of the world since then—and of the heroes among the one percent. 
Now, in the latest Wild Cards mosaic novel, we get to know the hardbitten world of Manhattan’s Fifth Precinct—or “Fort Freak,” as cops and malefactors alike call the cop-shop where every other desk sergeant, detective, and patrol officer is more than human. 
 
Featuring original work by writers such as Cherie Priest, author of the bestselling Boneshaker; Paul Cornell, Hugo–nominated comic book and Doctor Who writer; David Anthony Durham, winner of 2009’s John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer; and many others, Fort Freak is one of the strongest offerings yet in the ongoing Wild Cards project.

","Safe. Comfortable. Happy.Words we all love. Feelings we want. Even crave. We may love God, but being that he's invisible, words like comfortable seem to feel better faster.We are all chasing something. Our hearts were made to run hard and fast after things that move us. But as a generation we are all beginning to stir and wake up, identifying that these words don't satisfy for long, especially when compared to God. If God is real, and we are going to live with Him forever, shouldn't He be everything?Caught in this familiar haze of worldly happiness and empty pursuits, Jennie Allen and her husband Zac prayed a courageous prayer of abandonment that took them on an adventure God had written for them.""God, we will do anything.

Anything 

is a prayer of surrender that will spark something. A prayer that will move us to stop chasing things that just make us feel happy and start living a life that matters. A life that is...Surrendered. Reckless. Courageous.If we truly know a God worth giving anything for, everything changes.From Publisher's Weekly: ""Bible teacher Allen (creator of the new Stuck DVD Bible study) comes out of the gate strong, displaying accessibility and purposefulness in her first book. With an eye to the fears and doubts teeming beneath the surface for many female churchgoers, she compels her audience to figure out what's stopping them from using their God-given talents, and to be willing to do anything that God asks of them. By giving readers a glimpse of her own introspection and the interior life she's revealed on her personal blog, she employs heartfelt honesty to connect with readers. Tales of loved ones who have taken the ""journey to total abandonment"" show how giving one's life over to a higher purpose can ""wreck"" comfortable lives--and allow people to seize more important opportunities. Though the book is aimed at women who must balance their calling against more practical tasks like finishing the laundry and shopping at Target, Allen's friendly yet urgent messages will have the wheels spinning in the minds of all audiences and may be the tough medicine that propels them to action."" ""Jennie Allen is a visionary, a girlfriend, and a Jesus-chaser. I can't think of three qualities I appreciate more in a woman. I loved this book from cover to cover and have been really contemplating the way a one-word prayer can affect one's heart and ministry in this life. I want to be an 'anything' kind of girl, and I appreciate and respect the example Jennie has set in pursuing God and what he desires in us. It's just a word on a paper, but it's a lifetime choice that can make all the difference. You in?"" - Angie SmithSpeaker, Women of FaithAuthor,

In the spirit of adventure, Grady and Austin’s route and activities are kept secret—even from family—until after the journey. They complete daily, self-imposed Journey Tasks meant to deliberately immerse each into cultural authenticity, and out of their comfort zones. The two intend to experience other cultures and landscapes, but when the journey commences, it becomes clear that these travelers are in store for much more. From foreign militaries to spiritual clairvoyance, from serious illness to unnerving dares, The Amazing Journey reminds us to connect with people—be it those closest to you or those across the world—to test your limits, and to trust the Journey.",,,ebook,,,"

Three women have been strangled in their homes, and it appears to be the work of the same sadistic killer. With no sign of break-ins, every indication shows that the women let their attacker in willingly. The victims' neighbors and friends don't seem to remember anything unusual or suspicious, and Maeve is almost at a loss about how to move forward with the investigation.Then the evidence starts to point to a shocking suspect: DCI Josh Derwent, Maeve's partner on the police force. Maeve refuses to believe he could be involved, but how well does she really know him? Secrets Derwent has long kept locked away are coming back to haunt him, and the more Maeve learns about her partner's past, the more difficult it is to dismiss him as a suspect. After all, this is hardly the first time Derwent's been accused of murder.Jane Casey returns with her most outstanding novel yet in The Stranger You Know, a taut thriller and an intimate portrayal of complicated, all-too-human characters.",1250048834,9781250048837),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

Lynch, como todos los poetas, se inspira en la muerte, pero a diferencia de los demás, vive de ella. Trabaja como director de una funeraria en una pequeña población de Michigan donde se encarga de los entierros, cremaciones y actos fúnebres de su comunidad.En este libro las dos vocaciones se encuentran y Lynch se revela a la vez como competente funcionario del duelo y como escritor, que de manera conmovedora sintoniza el lenguaje con las fibras de la liberación interior.Con homenajes a los padres que han muerto y a los hijos que no debieron morir, con retratos de hipocondríacos, amantes y suicidas, El enterrador despliega una increíble gama de matices que van desde lo solemne, lo nostálgico y lo lírico, a lo mordaz y lo intensamente vivaz.",842046595X,9788420465951),Paperback,,258 pages,"

","In The Good War Terkel presents the good, the bad, and the ugly memories of World War II from a perspective of forty years of after the events. No matter how gruesome the memories are, relatively few of the interviewees said they would have been better off without the experience. It was a central and formative experience in their lives. Although 400,000 Americans perished, the United States itself was not attacked again after Pearl Harbor, the economy grew, and there was a new sense of world power that invigorated the country. Some women and African Americans experienced new freedoms in the post war society, but good life after World War II was tarnished by the threat of nuclear war.",1565843436,9781565843431),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","Well known and well regarded in the world of science fiction and fantasy writing, Vandana Singh brings her unique imagination to a wider audience in this collection of stories, newly reissued by Zubaan Books. In the title story, a woman tells her husband of her curious discovery: that she is inhabited by small alien creatures. In another, a young girl making her way to college through the streets of Delhi comes across a mysterious tetrahedron. Is it a spaceship? Or a secret weapon?The first Indian female speculative fiction writer, Singh has said that her genre is a “chance to find ourselves part of a larger whole; to step out of the claustrophobia of the exclusively human and discover joy, terror, wonder, and meaning in the greater universe.” A revolutionary voice in fantasy writing, Singh brings her passion for discovery to these stories, and the result is like nothing of this world.Contents:Hunger (2007)Delhi (2004)The Woman Who Thought She Was a Planet (2003)Infinities (2008)Thirst (2004)Conservation Laws (2008)Three Tales from Sky River: Myths for a Starfaring Age (2004)The Tetrahedron (2005)The Wife (2003)The Room on the Roof (2002)A Speculative Manifesto (2008) essay",,,Trade Paperback,,206 pages,"

","Tamiki Hara se hallaba en Hiroshima el día 6 de agosto de 1945 a las ocho y quince minutos, momento en que estalló la bomba que impondría una nueva manera de contemplar el mundo. Como él mismo describe en su impactante Flores de verano (obra ganadora del Premio Takitaro Minakami), en ese instante el autor se hallaba en una casa construida por su padre, lo suficientemente lejos del lugar de la explosión, gracias a lo cual pudo sobrevivir. Valiéndose de tres momentos narrativos diferentes, Hara narra el antes, el durante y el después de la tragedia. Con un lenguaje exento de florituras, durísimo, preciso y contundente, pero lleno de una hermosura casi poética, el autor narra cómo afloran a su alrededor la confusión, la destrucción, el horror, y lo mejor y lo peor de la condición humana.Esta obra, de una crudeza inusual, sufrió durante años la censura que prohibía a los japoneses publicar ningún tipo de escrito sobre la guerra. Es la primera vez que se traduce al castellano.",8415130074,9788415130079),Paperback,,136 pages,"

","I have only one request,"" Kafka wrote to his publisher Kurt Wolff in 1913. ""'The Stoker,' 'The Metamorphosis,' and 'The Judgment' belong together, both inwardly and outwardly. There is an obvious connection among the three, and, even more important, a secret one, for which reason I would be reluctant to forego the chance of having them published together in a book, which might be called The Sons.""Seventy-five years later, Kafka's request is granted, in a volume including these three classic stories of filial revolt as well as his own poignant ""Letter to His Father,"" another ""son story"" located between fiction and autobiography. A devastating indictment of the modern family, The Sons represents Kafka's most concentrated literary achievement as well as the story of his own domestic tragedy. Grouped together under this new title and in newly revised translations, these texts—the like of which Kafka had never written before and (as he claimed at the end of his life) would never again equal—take on fresh, compelling meaning.",0805208860,9780805208863),Paperback,,167 pages,"

","Liverpool's third season under Rafael Benítez was a tumultuous time both on and off the pitch. In 2007 Liverpool FC finally changed hands, with Americans George Gillett Jr. and Tom Hicks buying the club; work began on a radically redesigned state-of-the-art stadium at Stanley Park; and the team reached a seventh European Cup final. Without doubt a new era has begun.Above Us Only Sky is much more than just the story of one season. As well as reflecting on the recent past, this book looks to the future, to examine how the new regime can make the Reds competitive in all aspects of the game - from silverware, and the pounds (and dollars) that help secure it, through to the players to whom Gillett and Hicks will be looking to achieve success on the pitch, including exciting new signings Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel, to name just two. What do the Reds need to do to win a 19th league crown ?Above Us Only Sky also examines how Liverpool FC has evolved from the provincial club of the 1960s, to now touch the lives of people in every corner of the globe. What does it mean to be a Liverpool fan in the new millennium, either as a native Liverpudlian or as one born thousands of miles away ? How can the club move forward with a large and diverse fan base whose members, both local and global, have very different needs and desires ?",0955636701,9780955636707),Paperback,,170 pages,"

","Not too long from today, a new, highly contagious virus makes its way across the globe. Most who get sick experience nothing worse than flu, fever and headaches. But for the unlucky one percent - and nearly five million souls in the United States alone - the disease causes ""Lock In"": Victims fully awake and aware, but unable to move or respond to stimulus. The disease affects young, old, rich, poor, people of every color and creed. The world changes to meet the challenge.A quarter of a century later, in a world shaped by what's now known as ""Haden's syndrome,"" rookie FBI agent Chris Shane is paired with veteran agent Leslie Vann. The two of them are assigned what appears to be a Haden-related murder at the Watergate Hotel, with a suspect who is an ""integrator"" - someone who can let the locked in borrow their bodies for a time. If the Integrator was carrying a Haden client, then naming the suspect for the murder becomes that much more complicated.But ""complicated"" doesn't begin to describe it. As Shane and Vann began to unravel the threads of the murder, it becomes clear that the real mystery - and the real crime - is bigger than anyone could have imagined. The world of the locked in is changing, and with the change comes opportunities that the ambitious will seize at any cost. The investigation that began as a murder case takes Shane and Vann from the halls of corporate power to the virtual spaces of the locked in, and to the very heart of an emerging, surprising new human culture. It's nothing you could have expected.",0765375869,9780765375865),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Israel is a small and relatively young country, but its turbulent history has placed it squarely at the centre of the world stage for most of this century. For two millennia the Jews, dispersed all over the world, prayed for a return to Zion. Until the nineteenth century, that dream seemed a fantasy, but then a secular Zionist movement was born and soon the initial trickle of Jewish immigrants to Palestine turned into a flood as Jews fled persecution in Europe. From these beginnings, Martin Gilbert traces the events and personalities that would lead to the sudden, dramatic declaration of Statehood in May 1948.From that point on, Israel's history has been dominated by conflict: Suez, the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon and the Intifada. Using contemporary documents and eyewitness accounts, drawing on his own intimate knowledge of the country and its people, Martin Gilbert weaves together a seamless, page-turning history of a powerful and proud nation.",0552995452,9780552995450),Paperback,,786 pages,"

Soon after starting her investigative work for the police, Josephine discovers a secret organization called the Valituras that has amassed ancient magic and power with single-minded determination. Her new assignment of defeating this agency may prove to be an impossible feat as their members have infiltrated all levels of the government including law enforcement and their advanced wizardry rivals her own. Josephine realizes she may be in over her head when the Valituras end up casting an immortality curse on her best friend, Helen, by mistake. To further complicate matters, her grandson’s eighteen-year-old friend starts hitting on her. Fortunately, Helen isn’t too broken up by the curse.

","Nothing in Layla and Max's world will ever be the same. Since Max left, and joined his father in the Shadow Realm, everything in Layla's life has changed. The Demon Gods threaten to destroy the Otherworld, and an inconceivable darkness has awakened—a darkness that wants control of Layla's will. It also wants Max ... dead. Not only must Layla face the true fire simmering inside her, but fight the one she loves most. And this time, with her friends and family left behind, she's completely on her own. Leaving Layla nearly destroyed Max, but it was his only choice. Now, he must play the part—stay in control of his end goal, his actions, and the poison coursing through his veins, clouding his thoughts, and turning him into what he fears most, a Demon God. But even with his Oghams fighting the toxins, his control is slipping. Living in the Fomore castle with his Vampyre Fae ex-girlfriend isn't making it any easier to stay sane, and waiting to face off against Layla is taking its toll.In the final installment of the Fire Born Novels trilogy, the legendary Battle will be fought, and Layla and Max stand to lose everything. How far will they go to save each other and protect the ones they love? Even they don't know the answer. No one can win.From the ashes of old,They shall rise.The last of the Ancients,Foe and Ally.The Legend lies in wait,And bides its time.Until at last the day comes,For the children born of fire.",,,Kindle Edition,,256 pages,"

","This stunning debut captures the grotesque madness of a mystical under-land, as well as a girl's pangs of first love and independence. Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers--precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now. When her mother's mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice's tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice's mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.",1419709704,9781419709708),Paperback,,371 pages,"

","Në këtë roman bëhet fjalë për fundin e ushtrisë pushtuese italiane në Shqipëri. Pas kapitullimit të fashizmit, në portin e Durrësit tubohen ushtarët e mbetur nga lufta dhe presin anijet nga Italia për t'u kthyer në vendin e tyre. Pikërisht gjatë ditëve të pritjes në këtë qytet të improvizuar buzë detit, shkrimtari Petro Marko do të zbulojë histori, drama, karaktere, psikologji të nxjerra nga njerëzit e qytetit të fundit. Përveç kësaj autori do të sjellë edhe rrëfimin për dashurinë e oficerit të ri shqiptar Lekës dhe prostitutës së bukur italiane Ana Maria Monte, viktimë po ashtu e luftës dhe e fashizmit.Brenda 7 ditëve, aq sa qëndrojnë italianët e mbledhur në portin e Durrësit për t'u kthyer në Itali, shkrimtari në romanin ""Qyteti i fundit"" do të zbulojë dhe do të rrëfejë historitë dhe fatet e disave nga ushtria fashiste që para 4-5 viteve e kishte pushtuar Shqipërinë. Në këtë pleksje historish e fatesh, autori do të sajojë linjën e rrëfimit që ndjek hetimi për zbulimin e një krimineli lufte, të maskuar dhe të fshehur brenda turmës së ""Qytetit"".

Pista që ndjek togeri në këtë drejtim, e ngjashme me labirintet e romaneve dedektive, do të ecë dhe përmes prostitutës italiane - Ana Maria Monti. Dhe do të lindë dashuria mes tyre, që është shumëfish më ""mëkatare"" se ajo mes Gorit dhe Anitës. Leka është toger i Sigurimit Shtetëror të Shqipërisë së sapodalë nga lufta, që la pas shkatërrime dhe krime, ndërsa italiania Ana është e palës që i kreu ato krime, e palës së cilës i shërbente.Kështu shkrimtari, duke ndjekur këtë linjë do të ecë nëpër një teh të mprehtë: do ta lejojë togerin e Sigurimit t'i nënshtrohet zërit të brendshëm dhe të dashurohet me italianen e bukur, apo do të nxjerrë para tij fuqinë e përgjegjësisë dhe të mëkatit ndaj ""mollës së ndaluar""?

But when she is magically transported to the realm of Mistolear, she is stunned to learn that the stories were true, and that she is actually a princess. Suddenly, Willow has to fit into a royal family she didn't know she had, deal with customs she doesn't understand and sort out her feelings for Brand, the handsome knight who has sworn to protect her. On top of everything, she may also be the key to saving Mistolear from a terrifying spell. The nefarious faerie prince Nezeral has pitted two kingdoms against each other in a life-or-death chess match, in which people are the game pieces. As a pawn, Willow now glows with the light of the game and must find the courage and cleverness to battle Nezeral before her loved ones fall.

"," New From The Author of Vampire: The Richard Chase Murders and The Bundy Murders!  Think Kentucky is all about horses and mint juleps? You may revise that image with this excursion into the weird and the bizarre: from a medieval-esque murder in a small town museum to the jilted boyfriend who decided that his former girlfriend needed to die on her twenty-first birthday. And then there’s the demented son who returns home to live with his mother and stepfather, and one night in their beautiful mansion sitting atop a high bluff overlooking the Ohio River, slaughters them. Each case will keep you on the edge of your seat.  From The Author:As I began my research into past Kentucky killers and their victims, I was well aware there were a good number of very unusual homicides from the Bluegrass State, as I’d read about them over the years in newspapers accounts, heard the strange tales from relatives and friends, or watched the occasional newscasts on TV.  But these sources were never in-depth studies of the cases in question; and worse still, very often, erroneous information came forth, and it wasn’t until I began the research, using the original case files, that I’d find out what really happened. And it would be in these moments of discovery, that an accurate picture of each individual tragedy would rise and take shape from the seemingly innumerable police reports and interviews of those involved.  Indeed, many of these ten stories I’ve “unearthed” would have been lost forever had I not sought them out from the dusty archives and storage facilities scattered throughout the state; stories that would, ultimately, be destined for obscurity and eventual disposal as the decades dragged on.  Recently, one radio interviewer, contemplating their bizarre aspects, quite rightly stated how all of these Kentucky murders resembled something out of The Twilight Zone, and I quickly had to agree with his assessment. That’s the nature of these cases, and frankly, it was what I was looking for in my quest to uncover true crime in Kentucky.  From The Story ""Blood In The Moonlight"": “As Bauer led the officer to the side door where they entered the house through the kitchen, Kendrick asked if he knew who’d done this, and Bauer said, “No.” Just before stepping inside the home, Kendrick radioed the Emergency Medical Services unit, telling them to continue on to this address – code 3 – and that homicide units should be sent as well. Having notified dispatch, Kendrick then drew his weapon and entered a nightmare.""",,,Kindle Edition,,109 pages,"

Everett quickly became obsessed with their language and its cultural and linguistic implications. The Pirah� have no counting system, no fixed terms for color, no concept of war, and no personal property. Everett was so impressed with their peaceful way of life that he eventually lost faith in the God he'd hoped to introduce to them, and instead devoted his life to the science of linguistics.

Está estranhamente vestido, como um pequeno príncipe, esconde-se num manto azul. Perplexo, o viajante pega nele delicadamente. E, em cuidados, leva-o consigo. O menino só acordará mais tarde. Tem o cabelo loiro, da cor do trigo. E muitas perguntas para fazer. Aos poucos revela-se, fala de si, do seu pequeno planeta distante, de uma flor caprichosa que abandonou ao seu destino… e de um pequeno carneiro que aprisionou numa caixa de cartão, para que não fizesse mal à sua flor. O Regresso do Jovem Príncipe é uma história encantada, de A. G. Roemmers, o consagrado poeta Argentino.

","With the imagery of a poet and the reflection of a philosopher, David Whyte turns his attention to 52 ordinary words, each its own particular doorway into the underlying currents of human life.  Beginning with ALONE and closing with WORK, each chapter is a meditation on meaning and context, an invitation to shift and broaden our perspectives on the inevitable vicissitudes of life: pain and joy, honesty and anger, confession and vulnerability, the experience of feeling besieged and the desire to run away from it all. Through this lens, procrastination may be a necessary ripening; hiding an act of freedom; and shyness the appropriate confusion and helplessness that accompanies the first stage of revelation.  CONSOLATIONS invites readers into a poetic and thoughtful consideration of words whose meaning and interpretation influence the paths we choose and the way we traverse them throughout our lives.",1932887369,9781932887365),Hardcover,,245 pages,"

","In this New York Times bestselling erotic enovella trilogy, a buttoned-up businesswoman takes her friend’s advice and has a fling with a stranger on a trip to Vegas—only to find herself under his mysterious, sexy power both in the boardroom and the bedroom. Kasie Fitzgerald knows who she’s supposed to be. She’s a rising-star-workaholic at a global consulting firm. She’s the fiancée of a well-connected man who’s won the approval of her parents. People know that she’s reliable, serious, proper, cautious, pragmatic, and yes, a little predictable. She’s who Dave and her family want her to be. But as her thirtieth birthday looms, buried feelings begin to resurrect. Her friend takes her to Vegas for one last wild and crazy night. In a dress much shorter and sexier than anything she has ever dared to wear before, she hits the blackjack tables. And meets him. Under the tailored clothes it’s clear that this is a man who is intense, powerful, and maybe even a little dangerous. With a touch of trepidation she accepts his invitation to get a drink, and before long, she’s in his hotel room. She never gets his full name. Perhaps his anonymity is one of the reasons she’s able to give herself over to him and to the moment so completely. Perhaps it’s why she’s just had the most exquisite and passionate sex of her life. Shaken by her own behavior, Kasie tries to chalk it up to one crazy night. But when the mysterious gentleman she’s just had a fling with shows up in her office—as the CEO of a firm her company does a billion dollars of business with a year, demanding that she handle his account, and so much more—things will never be the same again. And there’s no telling where this will go…",1476730601,9781476730608),Paperback,,483 pages,"

"," Synopsis D'Invisible Ado à Singulière, il n'y a qu'un monde. Découvrez les aventures de Nea Wickham...« Êtes-vous prête à quitter le monde dans lequel vous vivez ? » La question est déroutante. Si vous ajoutez le fait qu’elle ait été posée par un Gnome, elle devient insensée. Ce petit bonhomme aussi bedonnant que caractériel est apparu le soir de mon quinzième anniversaire, après deux semaines placées sous le signe de l’anormalité. Avant ça, je collais parfaitement au cliché de l’adolescente insignifiante. Ma chambre était mon univers, internet mon domaine, l’asocialité ma première qualité. Et pourtant, c’est bien à moi que cet être surnaturel s’est intéressé. « Êtes-vous prête à quitter le monde dans lequel vous vivez ? » Pour aller où ? Pour faire quoi ? Je n’en avais pas la moindre idée à l’époque. Quasiment aucune explication ne me sera donnée sur ce monde où les légendes côtoient les lois, où la Nature règne et l’Autorité gouverne, où les pouvoirs sont Propres et les Éléments nôtres.

","Tavia Michaels is the sole survivor of the plane crash that killed her parents. When she starts to see strange visions of a boy she’s never spoken with in real life, she begins to suspect that there’s much about her past that she isn’t being told. Tavia immediately searches for answers, desperate to determine why she feels so drawn to a boy she hardly knows. But when Tavia discovers that the aunt and uncle who took her in after her parents' death may have actually been responsible for the plane crash that killed them - and that she may have been the true intended victim - she flees for the safety of Camden, Maine, where the boy she sees in her visions instructs her to go.Now, Tavia is on the run with no one to trust. No one, that is, except for her best friend and longtime crush, Benson.Tavia feels torn between the boy who mysteriously comes to her at night and the boy who has been by her side every step of the way. But what Tavia doesn't know is that the world is literally falling apart and that to save it she will have to unite with the boy in her visions. Only problem? To do so would mean rejecting Benson's love. And that's the one thing Tavia Michaels swore she'd never do.",1595146504,9781595146502),Hardcover,,338 pages,"

","Stephen King returns to the rich landscape of Mid-World, the spectacular territory of the Dark Tower fantasy saga that stands as his most beguiling achievement. Roland Deschain and his ka-tet—Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler—encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past. In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother’s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a “skin-man” preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast’s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day’s trials by reciting a story from the Magic Tales of the Eld that his mother often read to him at bedtime. “A person’s never too old for stories,” Roland says to Bill. “Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.” And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us.King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004. The Wind Through the Keyhole is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic. But this novel also stands on its own for all readers, an enchanting and haunting journey to Roland’s world and testimony to the power of Stephen King’s storytelling magic.~from first edition jacket",1451658907,9781451658903),Hardcover,US / Canada,309 pages,"

The tomb of China’s First Emperor, guarded by an underground army of terra-cotta warriors, has remained sealed for more than 2,000 years. Though it’s regarded as one of the greatest archaeological sites in the world, the Chinese government won’t allow anyone to open it. Why?
That question is at the heart of a dilemma faced by former Justice Department operative Cotton Malone, whose life is shattered when he receives an anonymous note carrying an unfamiliar Web address. Logging on, he sees Cassiopeia Vitt, a woman who’s saved his life more than once, being tortured at the hands of a mysterious man who has a single demand: Bring me the artifact she’s asked you to keep safe. The only problem is, Malone doesn’t have a clue what the man is talking about, since Cassiopeia has left nothing with him. So begins Malone’s most harrowing adventure to date; one that offers up astounding historical revelations, pits him against a ruthless ancient brotherhood, and sends him from Denmark to Belgium to Vietnam then on to China, a vast and mysterious land where danger lurks at every turn.",0345505492,9780345505491),Hardcover,,436 pages,"

Jocelyn's mother dropped dead suddenly when she was 17, and her father fell ill shortly afterwards, so she had to take the job in the shop rather than pursue her dreams. But then is she really unhappy? She has her weekends away, her friendships, her sewing blog, her work and its small pleasures. . .Then the twins persuade Jocelyn to enter the euromillion lottery and she wins 18 million euros. She could do anything with the money, change her life completely, but what does she really want? She doesn't tell anyone about the win. . . not just yet. . . Without cashing the cheque she begins to write down her 'list of desires' - a new coat, a bathmat, a visit to her daughter in England. She goes in to the Chanel shop in Paris, thinking she could buy anything she wants but will a new bag really make her any happier than the sandwich her husband prepared for her that morning? Meanwhile, her dressmaking blog is taking off, bringing her new friendships as well as business. And what if the money brings changes she can't foresee?",0297868357,9780297868354),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Call it fate. Call it synchronicity. Call it an act of God. Call it . . . The Good Luck of Right Now. From The New York Times bestselling author of The Silver Linings Playbook comes an entertaining and inspiring tale that will leave you pondering the rhythms of the universe and marveling at the power of kindness and love.For thirty-eight years, Bartholomew Neil has lived with his mother. When she gets sick and dies, he has no idea how to be on his own. His redheaded grief counselor, Wendy, says he needs to find his flock and leave the nest. But how does a man whose whole life has been grounded in his mom, Saturday mass, and the library learn how to fly?Bartholomew thinks he’s found a clue when he discovers a “Free Tibet” letter from Richard Gere hidden in his mother’s underwear drawer. In her final days, mom called him Richard—there must be a cosmic connection. Believing that the actor is meant to help him, Bartholomew awkwardly starts his new life, writing Richard Gere a series of highly intimate letters. Jung and the Dalai Lama, philosophy and faith, alien abduction and cat telepathy, the Catholic Church and the mystery of women are all explored in his soul-baring epistles. But mostly the letters reveal one man’s heartbreakingly earnest attempt to assemble a family of his own.A struggling priest, a “Girlbrarian,” her feline-loving, foul-mouthed brother, and the spirit of Richard Gere join the quest to help Bartholomew. In a rented Ford Focus, they travel to Canada to see the cat Parliament and find his biological father . . . and discover so much more.",006228553X,9780062285539),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","This classic exploration of human history vis-à-vis its link to Christianity ponders the question: What makes human beings uniquely human? In this thoughtful response to the rampant social Darwinism of the early twentieth century, G. K. Chesterton explains how religion — a blend of philosophy and mythology — satisfies both the human intellect and the spirit, and sets man starkly apart from any other living creature. Written in 1925, this enduring polemic still strikes a modern chord. Addressing evolution, feminism, and cultural relativism within the context of religion, the book also examines religious skepticism. How does one sustain belief in Jesus Christ — and the Church — when, throughout history, the key to religious truth has been constantly reshaped? According to Chesterton, the shape of the key is not important. What matters is that it fits the lock and opens the door. An emphatic affirmation of Christian faith, The Everlasting Man is leavened with the author's characteristic wit and wisdom, and appeals to the mind as well as the heart.",0486460363,9780486460369),Paperback,,272 pages,"

Now, with the creation of the spaceship Integral, that frontier—will be subjugated to the beneficent yoke of reason.One number, D-503, chief architect of the Integral, decides to record his thoughts in the final days before the launch for the benefit of less advanced societies.

","Diterjemahkan dari: The Tao of Islam: A Sourcebook on Gender Relationship in Islamic ThoughtPenerjemah: Rahmani Astuti, M.S. NasrullahThe Tao of Islam adalah sebuah antologi yang lengkap dan kaya di bidang pemikiran Islam tentang hakikat hubungan antara Tuhan dan alam semesta, alam semesta dan manusia, serta manusia dan Tuhan. Dengan memusatkan perhatian pada simbolisme gender, Sachiko Murata seorang Muslimah Jepang yang kini menjadi Profesor Studi-Studi Agama di State University of New York, Stony Brook memperlihatkan bahwa para pemikir Muslim klasik seringkali mengalisis realitas ketuhanan dan kaitannya dengan kosmos dan manusia melalui prinsip-prinsip polaritas atau komplementaritas, yang sangat mirip dengan gagasan filssafat Cina tentang yin/yang.Murata yakin bahwa kesatuan pemikiran Islam dapat ditemukan pada pemahaman tentang jenis-jenis hubungan yang ada dalam realitas. Dia memberi perhatian khusus pada pandangan berbagai tokoh yang dikenal sebagai kelompok sufi"" dan ""filosof"", karena pendekatan mereka terhadap topik-topik ini memiliki keluwesan dan kehalusan yang tidak ditemukan dalam kelompok pemikir lain. Dalam buku ini, kita dapat menemukan ratusan kutipan dari karya klasik pemikir Mulim penting seperti Ikhwan Al-Shafa, Ibn Sina, dan Ibn Arabi, yang banyak di antaranya baru pertama kali diterjemahkan di sini.",9794330957,9794330957,Paperback,,462 pages,"

","When the Iraq war began, conservationist Lawrence Anthony could think of only one thing: the fate of the Baghdad Zoo, located in the city center and caught in the war's crossfire. Once Anthony entered Baghdad he discovered that full-scale combat and uncontrolled looting had killed nearly all the animals of the zoo.But not all of them. U.S. soldiers had taken the time to help care for the remaining animals, and the zoo's staff had returned to work in spite of the constant firefights. Together the Americans and Iraqis had managed to keep alive the animals that had survived the invasion.Babylon's Ark chronicles the zoo's transformation from bombed-out rubble to peaceful park. Along the way, Anthony recounts hair-raising efforts to save a pride of the dictator's lions, close a deplorable black-market zoo, and rescue Saddam's Arabian horses. His unique ground-level experience makes Babylon's Ark an uplifting story of both sides working together for the sake of innocent animals caught in the war's crossfire.",0312358326,9780312358327),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.In this piercing story of innocence betrayed set in the thirties, the orphaned Portia is stranded in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of her wealthy half-brother's home in London. There she encounters the attractive, carefree cad Eddie. To him, Portia is at once child and woman, and he fears her gushing love. To her, Eddie is the only reason to be alive. But when Eddie follows Portia to a sea-side resort, the flash of a cigarette lighter in a darkened cinema illuminates a stunning romantic betrayal—and sets in motion one of the most moving and desperate flights of the heart in modern literature.",0385720173,9780385720175),Paperback,,418 pages,"

","What secrets are hiding in the heart of Paris?At the famous Patisserie Clermont in Paris, 1909, a chance encounter with the owner's daughter has given one young man a glimpse into a life he never knew existed: of sweet cream and melted chocolate, golden caramel and powdered sugar, of pastry light as air.But it is not just the art of confectionery that holds him captive, and soon a forbidden love affair begins.Almost eighty years later, an academic discovers a hidden photograph of her grandfather as a young man with two people she has never seen before. Scrawled on the back of the picture are the words 'Forgive me'. Unable to resist the mystery behind it, she begins to unravel the story of two star-crossed lovers and one irrevocable betrayal.Take a moment to savour an evocative, bittersweet love story that echoes through the decades – perfect for fans of Kate Morton, Rachel Hore and Victoria Hislop.",1784160725,9781784160722),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","My name is Cale Kinley and I’m a fucking Virgin…  Well, with the exception of my tongue. The countless things I can do with my tongue are bound to leave you breathless and begging for more, but more… is something that I can’t give. It’s a choice. My choice.  There’s a reason for that. A very good reason, and that reason is her.  Riley.  She’s the only woman that I want to bury myself deep in. The one woman I have wanted since I was old enough to fuck.  I never got my chance though, because she left. She had no choice and it stung like hell. But I couldn’t let her leave without telling her how I felt. I wanted her to be my first and I didn’t give a shit how long I’d have to wait.  It’s been six years and now she’s back and sexier than all hell. Just the sight of her stops my damn heart from beating. I want her and for more than just having her as my first.  I’m determined to have her in every way possible. She thinks this is still a game; that I’ve already given myself to countless women. What she doesn’t know is that I have a lot of willpower.  When I want something as badly as I want her, I don’t let shit stand in my way. I’m going to prove that to her. There’s just one little problem I need to take care of…  Him.",,,Kindle Edition,,157 pages,"

","In this book, Professor Murdock, an award-winning California State University teacher, has developed an innovative method to teach writers how to use the fictional tools and techniques available to them to create powerful stories that will engage readers from beginning to end. Using a step-by-step approach, Dr. Murdock takes writers through the creation of three example stories, stopping to discuss each writing decision as it occurs and explaining how each approach works to keep readers vicariously involved in the progression of the story. This is a book that will help writers understand how the choices they make affect readers in different ways. Even if you are not a writer, you will enjoy the three example stories, and you may find yourself intrigued to learn how stories are created.",,,Kindle Edition,,211 pages,"

","If the conscious mind - the part you consider to be you - is just the tip of the iceberg, what is the rest doing?In this sparkling and provocative new book, the renowned neuroscientist David Eagleman navigates the depths of the subconscious brain to illuminate surprising mysteries: Why can your foot move halfway to the brake pedal before you become consciously aware of danger ahead? Why do you hear your name being mentioned in a conversation that you didn't think you were listening to? What do Ulysses and the credit crunch have in common? Why did Thomas Edison electrocute an elephant in 1916? Why are people whose names begin with J more likely to marry other people whose names begin with J? Why is it so difficult to keep a secret? And how is it possible to get angry at yourself - who, exactly, is mad at whom?Taking in brain damage, plane spotting, dating, drugs, beauty, infidelity, synesthesia, criminal law, artificial intelligence, and visual illusions, Incognito is a thrilling subsurface exploration of the mind and all its contradictions.©2011 David Eagleman; (P)2011 Random House",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged,,"

De oplossing die is gevonden, heeft geleid tot uitstel van executie: ieder ongewenst kind wordt opgenomen en opgevoed door de Staat - maar iedere jongere tussen de dertien en achttien kan door de Staat of door zijn ouders worden opgegeven om 'gesplitst' te worden: ze worden gebruikt als donor voor mensen die een nieuw orgaan of ledemaat nodig hebben.

","The Complete Short Stories of Roald Dahl in the first of two unsettling and sinister volumes.'They are brutal, these stories, and yet you finish reading each one with a smile, or maybe even a hollow laugh, certainly a shiver of gratification, because the conclusion always seems so right' Charlie Higson, from his introduction.Roald Dahl is one of the most popular writers of the modern age, effortlessly writing for children and adults alike. In this, the first of two volumes chronologically collecting all his published adult short stories, we see how Dahl began by using his experiences in the war to write fiction but quickly turned to his powerful and dark imagination to pen some of the most unsettling and disquieting tales ever written.In 27 stories, written between 1944 and 1953, we encounter such classic tales as 'Man from the South', featuring a wager with appalling consequences; 'Lamb to the Slaughter', in which a wife murders her husband yet has a novel idea for throwing the police off the scent; and in 'The Sound Machine', the horrific truth about plants is revealed.Enter the sinister, twisted world of Roald Dahl: whether you're young or old, you'll never want to leave.'Roald Dahl is one of the few writers I know whose work can accurately be described as addictive' Irish Times'The great magician' SpectatorLook out for Volume Two, introduced by Anthony HorowitzRoald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson.

","Sota raivoaa katastrofin partaalla olevassa galaksissa. Seitsemän pyhiinvaeltajaa lähestyy Hyperionin Aikahautoja, kauhistuttavan Lepinkäisen kotia. Lepinkäinen on kuolettavan legendaarinen olento, puoliksi tappokone ja puoliksi Jumala. Sen voimat pystyvät muuttamaan ajan ja avaruuden lakeja.Pyhiinvaeltajat jakavat tarinansa etsien vastauksia kohtaloidensa syviin salaisuuksiin. Tältä matkalta eivät kaikki palaa, mutta henkensä uhalla he ovat päättäneet ratkaista universumin suurimman arvoituksen.Hyperion on nerokas kirjallinen kudos, sekoitus puhdasta iloa ja hyytävää kauhua. Se on voittanut arvostetut Hugo-, Locus- ja Tähtivaeltaja-palkinnot. Myös sarjan muut osat eli Hyperionin tuho, Endymion ja Endymionin nousu ovat olleet menestyksiä ympäri maailmaa.

","When the exotic stranger Vianne Rocher arrives in the old French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique called “La Celeste Praline” directly across the square from the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock. It is the beginning of Lent: the traditional season of self-denial. The priest says she’ll be out of business by Easter.To make matters worse, Vianne does not go to church and has a penchant for superstition. Like her mother, she can read Tarot cards. But she begins to win over customers with her smiles, her intuition for everyone’s favourites, and her delightful confections. Her shop provides a place, too, for secrets to be whispered, grievances aired. She begins to shake up the rigid morality of the community. Vianne’s plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community. Can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate éclair?For the first time, here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as an agent of transformation. Rich, clever, and mischievous, reminiscent of a folk tale or fable, this is a triumphant read with a memorable character at its heart.Says Harris: “You might see [Vianne] as an archetype or a mythical figure. I prefer to see her as the lone gunslinger who blows into the town, has a showdown with the man in the black hat, then moves on relentless. But on another level she is a perfectly real person with real insecurities and a very human desire for love and acceptance. Her qualities too - kindness, love, tolerance - are very human.” Vianne and her young daughter Anouk, come into town on Shrove Tuesday. “Carnivals make us uneasy,” says Harris, “because of what they represent: the residual memory of blood sacrifice (it is after all from the word ""carne"" that the term arises), of pagan celebration. And they represent a loss of inhibition; carnival time is a time at which almost anything is possible.”The book became an international best-seller, and was optioned to film quickly. The Oscar-nominated movie, with its star-studded cast including Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) and Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love), was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose previous film The Cider House Rules (based on a John Irving novel) also looks at issues of community and moral standards, though in a less lighthearted vein.The idea for the book came from a comment her husband made one day while he was immersed in a football game on TV. “It was a throwaway comment, designed to annoy and it did. It was along the lines of...Chocolate is to women what football is to men…” The idea stuck, and Harris began thinking that “people have these conflicting feelings about chocolate, and that a lot of people who have very little else in common relate to chocolate in more or less the same kind of way. It became a kind of challenge to see exactly how much of a story I could get which was uniquely centred around chocolate.” Rich with metaphor and gorgeous writing...sit back and gorge yourself on Chocolat.",,,Kindle Edition,,306 pages,"

Personajul principal al romanului trăiește o dublă poveste de dragoste: Am un iubit, B, și o iubită, R. În acest threesome este atrasă pe parcurs și D., o adolescentă de 14 ani, sora lui R.

","The New York Times bestselling author hailed as “the UK’s answer to Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, and Lena Dunham all rolled into one” (Marie Claire) makes her fiction debut with a hilarious yet deeply moving coming of age novel.What do you do in your teenage years when you realize what your parents taught you wasn’t enough? You must go out and find books and poetry and pop songs and bad heroes—and build yourself.It’s 1990. Johanna Morrigan, fourteen, has shamed herself so badly on local TV that she decides that there’s no point in being Johanna anymore and reinvents herself as Dolly Wilde—fast-talking, hard-drinking Gothic hero and full-time Lady Sex Adventurer. She will save her poverty-stricken Bohemian family by becoming a writer—like Jo in Little Women, or the Bröntes—but without the dying young bit.By sixteen, she’s smoking cigarettes, getting drunk and working for a music paper. She’s writing pornographic letters to rock-stars, having all the kinds of sex with all kinds of men, and eviscerating bands in reviews of 600 words or less.But what happens when Johanna realizes she’s built Dolly with a fatal flaw? Is a box full of records, a wall full of posters, and a head full of paperbacks, enough to build a girl after all?Imagine The Bell Jar written by Rizzo from Grease. How to Build a Girl is a funny, poignant, and heartbreakingly evocative story of self-discovery and invention, as only Caitlin Moran could tell it.",,,ebook,,368 pages,"

","Melanie stryder se recusa a desaparecer. Nosso planeta foi dominado por um inimigo que não pode ser detectado. Os humanos se tornaram hospedeiros dos invasores - suas mentes são extraídas, enquanto seus corpos permanecem intactos e prosseguem suas vidas aparentemente sem alteração. A maior parte da humanidade sucumbiu a tal processo. Quando Melanie, um dos humanos 'selvagens' que ainda restam, é capturada, ela tem certeza de que será seu fim. Peregrina, a 'alma' invasora designada para o corpo de Melanie, foi alertada sobre os desafios de viver dentro de um ser humano - as emoções irresistíveis, o excesso de sensações, a persistência das lembranças e das memórias vívidas. Mas há uma dificuldade que Peregrina não esperava - a antiga ocupante de seu corpo se recusa a desistir da posse de sua mente. Peregrina investiga os pensamentos de Melanie com o objetivo de descobrir o paradeiro dos remanescentes da resistência humana. Entretanto, Melanie ocupa a mente de sua invasora com visões do homem que ama - Jared, que continua a viver escondido. Incapaz de se separar dos desejos de seu corpo, Peregrina começa a se sentir intensamente atraída por alguém a quem foi submetida por uma espécie de exposição forçada. Quando os acontecimentos fazem de Melanie e Peregrina improváveis aliadas, elas partem em uma busca incerta e perigosa do homem que ambas amam.",859807859x,9788598078595),Paperback,,560 pages,"

","Everyone knows Bone Gap is full of gaps—gaps to trip you up, gaps to slide through so you can disappear forever. So when young, beautiful Roza went missing, the people of Bone Gap weren’t surprised. After all, it wasn’t the first time that someone had slipped away and left Finn and Sean O’Sullivan on their own. Just a few years before, their mother had high-tailed it to Oregon for a brand new guy, a brand new life. That’s just how things go, the people said. Who are you going to blame?Finn knows that’s not what happened with Roza. He knows she was kidnapped, ripped from the cornfields by a dangerous man whose face he cannot remember. But the searches turned up nothing, and no one believes him anymore. Not even Sean, who has more reason to find Roza than anyone, and every reason to blame Finn for letting her go.As we follow the stories of Finn, Roza, and the people of Bone Gap—their melancholy pasts, their terrifying presents, their uncertain futures—acclaimed author Laura Ruby weaves a heartbreaking tale of love and loss, magic and mystery, regret and forgiveness—a story about how the face the world sees is never the sum of who we are.",0062317601,9780062317605),Hardcover,,345 pages,"

","In un angolo del continente nordamericano c'è Crosby, nel Maine: un luogo senza importanza che tuttavia, grazie alla sottile lama dello sguardo della Strout, diviene lo specchio di un mondo più ampio. Perché in questo piccolo villaggio affacciato sull'Oceano Atlantico c'è una donna che regge i fili della storie, e delle vite, di tutti i suoi concittadini. È Olive Kitteridge, un'insegnante in pensione che, con implacabile intelligenza critica, osserva i segni del tempo moltiplicarsi intorno a lei, tanto che poco o nulla le sfugge dell'animo di chi le sta accanto: un vecchio studente che ha smarrito il desiderio di vivere; Christopher, il figlio, tirannizzato dalla sua sensibilità spietata; un marito, Henry, che nella sua stessa fedeltà al matrimonio scopre una benedizione, e una croce. E ancora, le due sorelle Julie e Winnie: la prima abbandonata sull'altare, ma non rassegnata a una vita di rinuncia, sul punto di fuggire ricorderà le parole illuminanti della sua ex-insegnante: Non abbiate paura della vostra fame. Se ne avrete paura, sarete soltanto degli sciocchi qualsiasi». Con dolore, e con disarmante onestà, in Olive Kitteridge si accampano i vari accenti e declinazioni della condizione umana – e i conflitti necessari per fronteggiarli entrambi. È il fragile, sottile miracolo di un'altissima pagina di storia della letteratura, regalataci da una delle protagoniste della narrativa americana contemporanea, vincitrice, grazie a questo “romanzo in racconti”, del Premio Pulitzer 2009.",886411033X,9788864110332),Paperback,Le Strade #158,383 pages,"

Ils en ressortiront profondément bouleversés, tout comme le lecteur de ce roman qui se déroule sur fond de guerre, proche et lointaine à la fois, en Bosnie, et où ressurgissent les fantômes des poilus de 14-18, des martyrs de la guerre d'Espagne, des déportés de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Une plongée passionnante dans l'étrange et dans la réalité, en même temps qu'une terrifiante approche des sentiments humains les plus vils. Pour une prise de conscience aussi, de l'importance du savoir et du souvenir.

Largely autobiographical, Christ in Concrete opens with the dramatic Good Friday collapse of a building under construction, which buries in its rubble the bricklayers working on the upper floors and literally crucifies in concrete Geremio, whose death leaves his pregnant wife and eight children impoverished. His bright, studious oldest son, Paul, at just twelve years of age, must take over his father's role - and job.",,,Hardcover,,,"

","Ein Künstler und ein Anwalt versuchen zu begreifen, was Wahrheit ist … Ferdinand von Schirachs neues Buch ist ein Künstlerroman, ein Justizdrama und am Ende ist es eine Beschreibung der Abgründe des Menschen. Sebastian von Eschburg verliert als Kind durch den Selbstmord seines Vaters den Halt. Er versucht sich durch die Kunst zu retten. Er zeigt mit seinen Fotografien und Videoinstallationen, dass Wirklichkeit und Wahrheit verschiedene Dinge sind. Es geht um Schönheit, Sex und die Einsamkeit des Menschen. Als Eschburg vorgeworfen wird, eine junge Frau getötet zu haben, übernimmt Konrad Biegler die Verteidigung. Der alte Anwalt versucht den Künstler zu helfen - und damit sich selbst. Schirach schreibt über ein aktuelles gesellschaftliches Thema, das den Leser zwingt, grundsätzliche Entscheidungen zu treffen. Aber dieses Buch ist viel mehr: Schirach hat den Roman eines Lebens geschrieben, lakonisch, poetisch und berührend. (Quelle: Amazon)",3492055699,9783492055697),Hardcover,,254 pages,"

Twelve-year-old September lives in Omaha, and used to have an ordinary life, until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn’t . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday.
 
With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan, Fairyland lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of Alice in Wonderland and the soul of The Golden Compass, here is a reading experience unto itself: unforgettable, and so very beautiful.

","From the publisher that brought you Game of Thrones… Prince of Thorns is the first volume in a powerful epic fantasy trilogy, original, absorbing and challenging.Before the thorns taught me their sharp lessons and bled weakness from me I had but one brother, and I loved him well. But those days are gone and what is left of them lies in my mother's tomb. Now I have many brothers, quick with knife and sword, and as evil as you please. We ride this broken empire and loot its corpse. They say these are violent times, the end of days when the dead roam and monsters haunt the night. All that's true enough, but there's something worse out there, in the dark. Much worse.From being a privileged royal child, raised by a loving mother, Jorg Ancrath has become the Prince of Thorns, a charming, immoral boy leading a grim band of outlaws in a series of raids and atrocities. The world is in chaos: violence is rife, nightmares everywhere. Jorg has the ability to master the living and the dead, but there is still one thing that puts a chill in him. Returning to his father's castle Jorg must confront horrors from his childhood and carve himself a future with all hands turned against him.Mark Lawrence's debut novel tells a tale of blood and treachery, magic and brotherhood and paints a compelling and brutal, and sometimes beautiful, picture of an exceptional boy on his journey toward manhood and the throne.",,,Kindle Edition,,333 pages,"

But their greatness on the field was nearly eclipsed by how bad they were off it.

On a lovely spring day, violence intrudes on Tess Maher's world; her best friend, running buddy and possible soul-mate, Chick Donnelly, is shot and killed practically right before her eyes. At first glance, his death appears to be a hunting accident, but she and her brother, the county sheriff, quickly rule that out. Tess is all but certain that Chick is the victim of foul play. As she investigates the crime, she is plunged into a world of murder, greed, betrayal, and terror--all of which eventually makes her a target as she works to bring the killer to justice. But what the person who took Chick's life doesn't know is exactly who he's dealing with: a pissed off, grief-stricken, gun-toting woman who is described by her own mother as tenacious as a pit bull with a bone. And that doesn't even count the fact that she has a peculiar habit of talking to the dead. Really big trouble is knocking on the killer's door, and her name is Tess...",,,ebook,,,"

Nessuno l’accetta, neppure i genitori che per lei non conoscono dolcezza, tantomeno le sue sorelle Ada e Dolores che si divertono a tormentarla con giochi crudeli. Per questo la decisione è drastica: quella ragazzina è un mostro, spaventa le persone, non dovrà mai uscire di casa. Così Lulù si crea un universo privato per sopravvivere alla realtà che la rifiuta, fino a quando l’incontro con Mimì, una bambola con un braccio e un occhio solo, nel giorno del suo sesto compleanno la trascinerà nella più grande avventura della sua vita. Insieme dovranno raggiungere il Mondo del Mistero e, tra mille incontri e fantastiche acrobazie, sconfiggere i pregiudizi, origine di ogni infelicità. In un libro che unisce, all’interno di una sontuosa architettura narrativa, la dolcezza del Piccolo principe, il fantastico di Alice nel paese delle meraviglie e l’inquietudine di Pinocchio, Isabella Santacroce ci spalanca le porte di tutto il suo immaginario e ci trascina in un romanzo fiaba indimenticabile e senza tempo.",8817037680,9788817037686),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","“Happiness and success are not just goals to reach: they are a way of living...” (Eyal Sabag)Eyal Sabag is one of the most sought-out coaches and motivational speakers in Israel. Here he provides a “hindsight” glimpse into his unbelievable life, revealing his story of transformation: from almost complete disability (caused by cerebral palsy at birth) to a lifetime of fulfillment and self-realization. As Eyal often advises, “if I can do it, so can you!”At the age of 24, after enduring years of self pity, needy reliance on others, insecurity, and a strong belief that his life is just a product of one case of very bad luck, Eyal found another way to live. On this new path, which he calls “From Disable to Able,” Eyal has learned how to use the seemingly magical power of the subconscious, positive thinking, and imagination; all of which opened the door to a brand new world: one in which he retook control over his choices and actions in life. Eyal now leads a life enriched by taking practical and responsible actions. He says he has never felt happier, stronger, or more whole. Through a deep inner perspective, enhanced by a light and humoristic approach to life in the face of hardships, in this book Eyal provides you with a set of practical tools that allow you to go from a “fixation state-of-mind” to spiritual, mental and physical prosperity and freedom. Ask yourself the following questions:Are you happy?Is there love in your life?Do you feel content with what you do?Are you satisfied with your employment situation?Do you just make ends meet each month?Are you appreciated where you work?Are you aware of the huge potential that lies within you?Do you believe that your future is predetermined and cannot be changed?This book is for you if you’re ready to change your mindset, and delve into new and exciting life’s adventures. The Hebrew version of Eyal’s book sold thousands of copies in Israel, and is finally brought to you in English. Mr. Sabag is an Adlerian coach and motivational speaker. Among his clients one finds organizations such as the Israeli Air Force, the Adler Institute, the National Security Institute, government offices, Tec companies, and many others.",,,Kindle Edition,,293 pages,"

","The spiritual life in Islam begins with riyadat al-nafs, the inner warfare against the ego. Distracted and polluted by worldliness, the lower self has a tendency to drag the human creature down into arrogance and vice. Only by a powerful effort of will can the sincere worshipper achieve the purity of soul which enables him to attain God's proximity.This translation of two chapters from The Revival of the Religious Sciences (Ihya' 'Ulum al-Din) details the sophisticated spiritual techniques adopted by classical Islam. In the first step, On Disciplining the Soul, which cites copious anecdotes from the Islamic scriptures and biographies of the saints, Ghazali explains how to acquire good character traits, and goes on to describe how the sickness of the heart may be cured. In the second part, Breaking the Two Desires, he focusses on the question of gluttony and sexual desire, concluding, in the words of the Prophet, that 'the best of all matters is the middle way'. The translator has added an introduction and notes which explore Ghazali's ability to make use of Greek as well as Islamic ethics. The work will prove of special interest to those interested in Sufi mysticism, comparative ethics, and the question of sexuality in Islam.",0946621438,9780946621439),Paperback,,370 pages,"

","Ted Bundy received hundreds of love letters from women every week while he was in prison. Women not only sent fan love mail, but marriage proposals, money and gifts. The same goes for Jeffrey Dahmer, Richard Ramirez, John Wayne Gacy and many other notorious and not so famous serial killers.  Groupies will do almost anything to get close to the prisoner that they are attracted to. They give up jobs, family, spend money on him, and even move across country to be in the same town as him. Most Serial Killer Groupies (SKG's) are attractive and well educated, for example, Doreen Lioy who married Ramirez had an above-average IQ of 152 and a University Degree. Many are already married, they are mothers, and in several cases, they work in law enforcement or psychology. They sometimes wait for hours just to have a few minutes every week or so to have a face-to-face visit in the prison.  Some SKG's are attracted to the celebrity status they acquire. They go on talk shows to announce their undying love for the serial killer and proclaim that he was not capable of these killings. Or, that he has changed. Some have taken credit for 'changing' the killer and that he's been regenerated.  The research and writing of Serial Killer Groupies started in 2012 after an interview I had with Paul Bernardo, who receives copious amounts of fan mail each month. This book depicts several cases of fan fare some killers receive and known medical conditions that many 'groupies' have.",,,Kindle Edition,,265 pages,"

","A sweeping historical novel of composer and priest Antonio Vivaldi, a secret wealthy mistress, and their passion for music and each other Like most 18th century Venetians, Adriana d'Amato adores music-except her strict merchant father has forbidden her to cultivate her gift for the violin. But she refuses to let that stop her from living her dreams and begins sneaking out of her family's palazzo under the cover of night to take violin lessons from virtuoso violinist and composer Antonio Vivaldi. However, what begins as secret lessons swiftly evolves into a passionate, consuming love affair.Adriana's father is intent on seeing her married to a wealthy, prominent member of Venice's patrician class-and a handsome, charming suitor, whom she knows she could love, only complicates matters-but Vivaldi is a priest, making their relationship forbidden in the eyes of the Church and of society. They both know their affair will end upon Adriana's marriage, but she cannot anticipate the events that will force Vivaldi to choose between her and his music. The repercussions of his choice-and of Adriana's own choices-will haunt both of their lives in ways they never imagined.Spanning more than 30 years of Adriana's life, Alyssa Palombo's The Violinist of Venice is a story of passion, music, ambition, and finding the strength to both fall in love and to carry on when it ends.",1250071496,9781250071491),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","Sie war die weibliche Ikone der 68er-Bewegung, dazu Model, Muse, Groupie, Lebenshungrige. Das Bett teilte sie mit Mick Jagger und Keith Richards, kaum eine Droge hat sie ausgelassen -- sie stand für die neue, freizügige Weiblichkeit, die alles konnte und alles machte. In High Times schildert Uschi Obermaier in authentischem Erzählton Episoden aus ihrem wilden Leben. Grundlage sind 50 Stunden Interview mit dem Journalisten und Drehbuchautor Olaf Kraemer aus dem Jahr 1992. Das Material lag dann fast 15 Jahre auf Eis, weil es sowohl ihr selbst als auch zahlreichen deutschen Verlagen zu drastisch erschien. Nun hat sie es doch publiziert, in ihrem ganz eigenen Sound, der perfekt zu dem rasanten Leben passt, das jahrzehntelang wie ein Roadmovie im Zeitraffer ablief. Zu Anfang sehen wir die kleine Uschi in Sendling, schon damals war sie von den ""wilden Jungs"" im Ort fasziniert. Da gab's die ersten Kellerpartys, geraucht wurde ""Judenstrick"" und nebenbei ""so'n bisschen an den Titties angefasst"". Dann kam der erste Sex, Sex in der Kirche, im Freien, in der Isetta, überall wurde ""rumgemacht"", die Entdeckung der Lust hatte etwas Religiöses. Es folgte der Sprung nach München, sie ""eroberte die Welt an der Seite eines Mannes"", im Big Apple wurde bis morgens gesoffen, gekifft, gesnift und geliebt. Immer schon wollte Uschi Obermaier Verbotenes ausprobieren. Sie ging mit den durchreisenden Musikern aufs Hotelzimmer, schmiss LSD-Trips und machte die ersten Foto-Shootings. 1968 begegnete ihr mit Rainer Langhans die erste große Liebe, Stichwort: Kommune 1 in Berlin. Für die Medien waren sie ""das schönste Paar der APO"" (Stern). Dabei war Uschi Obermaier hoffnungslos unpolitisch und blieb für die übrigen Kommunarden immer das dumme Fotomodell, das bei den endlosen Gruppensessions regelmäßig einschlief. Schließlich ging es zurück nach München, Mick Jagger und Keith Richards klingelten in derselben Nacht an ihrer Tür -- Ersterer machte damals das Rennen, zu dem geplanten Dreier mit David Bowie ist es niemals gekommen. Es folgten die zehn intensiven und selbstzerstörerischen Jahre mit Dieter Bockhorn, dem wilden Prinzen aus Hamburg, mit dem sie nach Indien reiste und im Wohnmobil durch die USA tourte, der aber immer mehr in seiner Drogensucht versank. High Times steht für Sex, Drugs, Rock'n Roll -- dennoch werden Voyeure in dem Buch weniger auf ihre Kosten kommen, dafür aber all diejenigen, die sich ein authentisches Bild einer ganz ungewöhnlichen Stil-Ikone machen wollen.-- Henrik Flor, Literaturtest",3000261389,9783000261381),,,,,"['Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'European Literature', 'German Literature']"

","A wealthy and notorious clan, the Bellefleurs live in a region not unlike the Adirondacks, in an enormous mansion on the shores of mythic Lake Noir. They own vast lands and profitable businesses, they employ their neighbors, and they influence the government. A prolific and eccentric group, they include several millionaires, a mass murderer, a spiritual seeker who climbs into the mountains looking for God, a wealthy noctambulist who dies of a chicken scratch.Bellefleur traces the lives of several generations of this unusual family. At its center is Gideon Bellefleur and his imperious, somewhat psychic, very beautiful wife, Leah, their three children (one with frightening psychic abilities), and the servants and relatives, living and dead, who inhabit the mansion and its environs. Their story offers a profound look at the world's changeableness, time and eternity, space and soul, pride and physicality versus love. Bellefleur is an allegory of caritas versus cupiditas, love and selflessness versus pride and selfishness. It is a novel of change, baffling complexity, mystery.Written with a voluptuousness and startling immediacy that transcends Joyce Carol Oates's early works, Bellefleur is widely regarded as a masterwork—a feat of literary genius.",0452267943,9780452267947),Paperback,,592 pages,"

Genes illuminate everything from JFK's bronze skin (it wasn't a tan) to Einstein's genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.

","Stephen Hawking is one of the world's leading cosmologists and is widely regarded as the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein. Although he has been widely published within his specialized field, A Brief History of Time is the first work he has written for the non-mathematical layman. In it he explores the outer reaches of our knowledge of astrophysics and the nature of time and the universe. The result is a revelation: a book that not only serves as an introduction to today's most important theories on the cosmos but affords a unique opportunity to experience one of the most imaginative and influential thinkers of our age.Confined to a wheelchair for the last twenty years by a motor-neurone disease, Professor Hawking is best known for his work on black holes. But here he turns his mind to the biggest question of all: the search for a unified theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics.Always in the clearest, most accessible terms, Stephen Hawking reviews the great theories of the cosmos. From Galileo and Newton to Einstein and Poincaré, and then moves on into deepest space for the greatest intellectual adventure of all. Could time run backwards? Will a ""no boundary"" universe replace the big bang theory? What happens in a universe with eleven dimensions? These are just some of the questions considered with devastating lucidity and brilliance in A Brief History of Time, a work that is bound to become a classic of its kind.",0593015185,9780593015186),Hardcover,,198 pages,"

Stuck in the lethal outer rings of Glacium, I must fight to survive until I can find the answers I seek and find a way back to the Bruma castle. Being a Solati from the enemy world of Osolis would be bad enough, but being the Tatuma, the next in line to rule…No one can find out who I really am. Especially now the veil is off.  Has the Tatum refused King Jovan’s peace offers and declared war? Do my brothers and Aquin know I’m alive? Who are my enemies and who are my friends? Nothing is certain. Though, if I think about it, nothing has been certain in a long time. All of my worries must be put aside.  I can’t imagine many distracted fighters survive The Pit.

","This is a book about universes, a story that revolves around a single unusual and unappreciated fact: that Einstein's famous theory of relativity describes universes -- entire universes. Not many solutions of Einstein's tantalizing universe equations have ever been found, but those that have are all very remarkable. Some of them describe universes that expand in size, while others contract, some rotate like a top and others are chaotic. Some are perfectly smooth, while others are lumpy, or shaken in different directions by tides of energy; some oscillate forever, some become lifeless and cold, while others head towards a runaway future of ever-increasing expansion. Some permit time travel into the past, and others allow infinitely many things to happen in a finite amount of time. Only a few allow life to evolve within them; the rest remain unknowable to conscious minds. Some end with a bang, some with a whimper. Some don't end at all.Our story will encounter universes where the laws of physics can change from time to time and from one region to another, universes that have extra hidden dimensions of space and time, universes that are eternal, universes that live inside black holes, universes that end without warning, colliding universes, inflationary universes, and universes that come into being from something else -- or from nothing at all.Gradually, we will find ourselves introducing the latest and the best descriptions of the Universe we see around us today, together with the concept of the 'Multiverse' -- the universe of all possible universes -- that modern theories of physics lead us to contemplate. These are the most fantastic and far-reaching speculations in the whole of science.Other cosmology and astronomy books focus on particular topics -- dark matter, dark energy, the beginning of the universe, inflation, life-supporting coincidences, or the end of the universe -- but this book introduces the reader to whole universes in a coherent and unified way.",1847920985,9781847920980),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

Nada saben de la terrible amenaza que se cierne sobre el continente. No saben aun que nada volverá a ser como fue. El Bien y el Mal, como en todo gran relato épico, librarán una batalla terrenal, pero también habrá fuerzas intangibles, mágicas, cósmicas.

","In a world where technology is magic, and war is the only way of life, Talyn is a soldier, one of thousands trained from childhood to protect her country from the monarchist Eastil, who would take away the personal freedoms of the Tonk.Talyn long ago embraced her fate: to die in battle. This is a war of magic, not of swords, and the battles are fought deep inside the View, a place where the magic inherent in everything and everyone is actualized. The soldiers--on both sides--can bring this magic to the physical plane and use it to destroy houses, fields, and people.But the Feegash came from across the world, and demanded to be allowed to negotiate peace between the Eastil and the Tonk for the sake of the rest of the world. Their success meant Talyn was out of a job, and at a loss for what to do with her life.Rather than follow most of her fellow soldiers to jobs in other parts of the world, Talyn stayed with her family in her town--and there she is seduced by a Feegash diplomat. With him she experiences a dark side of herself that she hadn't even imagined, and learns a new kind of magery.And she discovers the mistreatment of Eastil prisoners of war, still in Tonk hands, and weighs her life against saving theirs.It's a matter of honor--and her honor will be challenged again and again as she slowly discovers that what the Feegash have brought with them was not peace but an overwhelming oppression, and an evil so insidious no one noticed it until it was too late.But if Talyn can hone her use of the Feegash flesh-magery, she can turn their own magic back against them. With the help of one of the Eastil prisoners, she might be able to use it to save the Tonk andthe Eastil, and defeat the Feegash once and for all... if it doesn't destroy her from the inside out first.",0765309939,9780765309938),Hardcover,,528 pages,"

","Vladimir Nabokov: Sex, Lies, and Premium CableBy now, you undoubtedly know that Adrian Lyne's film version of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita received its much belated American debut on August 2nd, on Showtime, and will be released in theaters next month. You very likely also know that the movie was, well, not exactly banned, but effectively so, by the refusal of American film distributors to participate in its release. And you probably have a sense of what the fuss was all about: The film is reportedly too racy for American eyes. But there's a very different angle on this story to be found through a closer look at the novel.Nabokov's Lolita was originally published in 1955 and immediately became embroiled in its own censorship battles. The story is admittedly, purposefully, a shocking one: Humbert Humbert, an emigré academic, has a thing for young girls. Nymphets, he calls them, prepubescent girls who betray some precocious awareness of their own sensuality. Upon accepting a position at a new college, Humbert rents a room in town and falls madly, passionately, horrifyingly in love with his landlady's 12-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze, the Lolita of the novel's title. He marries Dolores's mother in order to maintain proximity to Dolores herself, and his relationship with her very quickly exceeds the bounds of stepfatherly affection. There are several upsetting things about this story, not the least of which is that, it appears, Lolita herself is the seducer, and Humbert the seducee. Hence the ubiquitous comparisons of any precociously sexual, slightly dangerous girl to this character (for example, the ""Long Island Lolita""). These comparisons -- and the moral censorship to which the novel has been subject -- are, however, based on a most superficial reading of the book, one that overlooks a basic literary concept: the unreliable narrator.Humbert Humbert is the one who tells us the story. From an insane asylum. He's a child molester and, ultimately, a murderer. Why on earth should we take his word for how it happened?This, in fact, is the real story of Lolita. The novel is about the ways in which a reader can be manipulated to feel sympathy for -- even to identify with -- the most horrifying person imaginable. That early readers of the novel were so shocked by Dolores's behavior -- so shocked, in fact, that governments moved to ban the book -- is precisely Nabokov's point: Rather than acknowledge the ultimate evil that lies under the otherwise charming persona, we as a culture are more inclined to turn him into a tragic hero, a victim.Lolita was, of course, filmed years ago by Stanley Kubrick. Nabokov wrote a screenplay for the movie that was ultimately cast aside. The Kubrick film is quirky, almost to a fault; Nabokov himself reportedly said that he liked the movie quite a lot, though it had nothing whatsoever to do with his novel. Kubrick managed to evade at least some of the moral terror surrounding his subject by casting Sue Lyons as Dolores. Lyons was 16 when the film was shot, a slightly too young woman rather than a child. Adrian Lyne has left himself no such comfort zone. While in London earlier this summer, I happily got a chance to see the new film and form my own opinions, the first of which is this: Dominique Swain is stunning as Dolores, one moment a seductress and the very next a gawky child. And Jeremy Irons's Humbert is passionate and terrifying. The film is lushly, beautifully shot -- uncomfortably so, at moments -- and quite faithful to the novel. At least to what the novel claims to say, what Humbert says it says. But the film misses, unfortunately, exactly what the critics all along have missed: Humbert Humbert is not to be trusted. This is, I suspect, one of the fundamental differences in narrative possibility between the novel and film, one that makes any complete adaptation of Lolita all but impossible: Film really has no equivalent to the unreliable narrator. Some films do experiment with multiple perspectives -- see, for instance, Kurosawa's Rashomon -- and so manage to cast doubt on any sense of truth. More recently, The Opposite of Sex presents a thoroughly untrustworthy narrator, but one who happily tells the audience when she's lying. But the puzzle presented by a narrator as charming and horrible as Humbert Humbert is perhaps one that can only be appreciated through the novel.Nabokov plays repeatedly throughout his novels with such narrative puzzles. Pale Fire, for instance, presents itself as the definitive annotated edition of the last poem of the late John Shade, with commentary by his faithful friend, Charles Kinbote. But the commentary has far more to do with Kinbote than it does with Shade's poem, and ultimately reveals that Kinbote may not be at all who he claims to be, and may in fact not be the identity he's hiding, either. Pnin is the third-person story of a befuddled Russian academic whose perceptions of reality seem more than a little skewed. Ada, or Ardor is the ultimate family romance, a philosophical treatise posing as a novel, annotated by Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov and a character who receives brief mention in Lolita). And Despair is literally, as all of Nabokov's novels are figuratively, a mystery.These mysteries are the heart of Nabokov's writing, and though LOLITA appears a straightforward story, the reader should always be wary. My recommendations about Lolita: See the film. It's beautiful, it's compelling, and it's important. But more to the point: Read the novel. If you've never read it, I envy you the joys of your first encounter with it. If you've read it before, read it again; it offers up something new each time. As do all of Nabokov's intricate puzzles: Each text begs you to take it apart, look at it from the other side, figure out where the truth might actually lie.Kathleen Fitzpatrick",2070368998,9782070368990),Mass Market Paperback,,501 pages,"

","From the author of the “thrilling” (The Christian Science Monitor) novel The Other Typist comes an evocative, multilayered story of ambition, success, and secrecy in 1950s New York.   In 1958, Greenwich Village buzzes with beatniks, jazz clubs, and new ideas—the ideal spot for three ambitious young people to meet. Cliff Nelson, the son of a successful book editor, is convinced he’s the next Kerouac, if only his father would notice. Eden Katz dreams of being an editor but is shocked when she encounters roadblocks to that ambition. And Miles Tillman, a talented black writer from Harlem, seeks to learn the truth about his father’s past, finding love in the process. Though different from one another, all three share a common goal: to succeed in the competitive and uncompromising world of book publishing. As they reach for what they want, they come to understand what they must sacrifice, conceal, and betray to achieve their goals, learning they must live with the consequences of their choices. In Three-Martini Lunch, Suzanne Rindell has written both a page-turning morality tale and a captivating look at a stylish, demanding era—and a world steeped in tradition that’s poised for great upheaval.",0399165487,9780399165481),Hardcover,,500 pages,"

'You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.'
In this brilliant piece of social comedy Forster is concerned with one of his favourite themes: the 'undeveloped heart' of the English middle classes, who are here represented by a group of tourists and expatriates in Florence. The English abroad are observed with a sharply ironic eye, but one of them, the young and unaffected Lucy Honeychurch, is also drawn with great sympathy.In her relationships with her dismal cousin Charlotte, with the unconventional Emersons and--the scene transferred to England--with her supercilious fiancé, Lucy is torn between lingering Victorian properties, social and sexual, and the spontaneous promptings of her heart ('an undeveloped heart, not a cold one'). Thus there are hidden depths of meaning in this sunniest and most readable of Forster's novels.This edition includes Forster's light-hearted sequel, 'A View without a Room"".",0140180788,9780140180787),Paperback,Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics Edition,256 pages,"

Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders?When Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy; perhaps it will buy his family meat for the winter.

","Nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American ReadOften called the greatest novel ever written, War and Peace is at once an epic of the Napoleonic Wars, a philosophical study, and a celebration of the Russian spirit. Tolstoy's genius is seen clearly in the multitude of characters in this massive chronicle--all of them fully realized and equally memorable. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual's place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed War and Peace in the same category as the Iliad:  ""To read him . . . is to find one's way home . . . to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.""",0679600841,9780679600848),Hardcover,,1386 pages,"

","An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here.Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with ""cynical adolescent."" Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,  ""If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.""

Jack tells everyone in his life he's okay, but no one believes him. Not his employees at Patriot Mulch & Tree in suburban North Carolina, not Beth herself, and not Canavan's estranged girlfriend Rena, who arrives on Jack's doorstep to see how, and whether, he's bearing up. When Jack starts letting Rena further into his life, and when Hendrick suddenly starts speaking fluent Spanish-stunning everyone-it becomes apparent to Jack that the world is far more complicated than he believed. As Drew Perry's characters change houses, partners, and perceptions, Hendrick emerges from his shell in unexpected and delightful ways and becomes, at times, this witty and winning debut novel's center of gravity-he's parenting the confused grown-ups as often as they are him.

Hilda, the older child, is both self-sacrificing and domineering, as puritanical as she is gorgeous; Eustace is a gentle, dreamy, pleasure-loving boy: the two siblings could hardly be more different, but they are also deeply devoted.

Section One provides an introduction and a brief history of the decade. Beginning with 1970 and proceeding chronologically by year of its release in the United States, Section Two offers an entry for each film. Each entry includes several categories of information: Critical Reception (sampling both '70s and later reviews), Cast and Credits, P.O.V., (quoting a person pertinent to that film's production), Synopsis (summarizing the film's story), Commentary (analyzing the film from Muir's perspective), Legacy (noting the rank of especially worthy '70s films in the horror pantheon of decades following). Section Three contains a conclusion and these five appendices: horror film cliches of the 1970s, frequently appearing performers, memorable movie ads, recommended films that illustrate how 1970s horror films continue to impact the industry, and the 15 best genre films of the decade as chosen by Muir.",0786431040,9780786431045),Paperback,,684 pages,"

","In the summer of 2010, photographer Brandon Stanton began an ambitious project -to single-handedly create a photographic census of New York City. The photos he took and the accompanying interviews became the blog Humans of New York. In the first three years, his audience steadily grew from a few hundred to over one million. In 2013, his book Humans of New York, based on that blog, was published and immediately catapulted to the top of the NY Times Bestseller List. It has appeared on that list for over twenty-five weeks to date. The appeal of HONY has been so great that in the course of the next year Brandon's following increased tenfold to, now, over 12 million followers on Facebook. In the summer of 2014, the UN chose him to travel around the world on a goodwill mission that had followers meeting people from Iraq to the Ukraine to Mexico City via the photos he took.Now, Brandon is back with the follow up to Humans of New York that his loyal followers have been waiting for: Humans of New York: Stories. Ever since Brandon began interviewing people on the streets of NY, the dialogue he's had with them has increasingly become as in-depth, intriguing and moving as the photos themselves. Humans of New York: Stories presents a whole new group of humans, complete with stories that delve deeper and surprise with greater candour. Let Brandon Stanton and the people he's photographed astonish you.",1250058902,9781250058904),Hardcover,,428 pages,"

","The highly anticipated new memoir by bestselling author Glennon Doyle Melton tells the story of her journey of self-discovery after the implosion of her marriage.Just when Glennon Doyle Melton was beginning to feel she had it all figured out—three happy children, a doting spouse, and a writing career so successful that her first book catapulted to the top of the New York Times bestseller list—her husband revealed his infidelity and she was forced to realize that nothing was as it seemed. A recovering alcoholic and bulimic, Glennon found that rock bottom was a familiar place. In the midst of crisis, she knew to hold on to what she discovered in recovery: that her deepest pain has always held within it an invitation to a richer life.Love Warrior is the story of one marriage, but it is also the story of the healing that is possible for any of us when we refuse to settle for good enough and begin to face pain and love head-on. This astonishing memoir reveals how our ideals of masculinity and femininity can make it impossible for a man and a woman to truly know one another - and it captures the beauty that unfolds when one couple commits to unlearning everything they’ve been taught so that they can finally, after thirteen years of marriage, fall in love.Love Warrior is a gorgeous and inspiring account of how we are born to be warriors: strong, powerful, and brave; able to confront the pain and claim the love that exists for us all. This chronicle of a beautiful, brutal journey speaks to anyone who yearns for deeper, truer relationships and a more abundant, authentic life.",1250075726,9781250075727),Hardcover,,267 pages,"

It is also the story of citizens in crisis: a woman fighting ceaselessly to give her great-grandchildren a better life, a father of six who may lose his job at the Navy Shipyard, and a policy analyst whose experiences as a crime victim tempt her to abandon her job and ideals. Heart-wrenching and hilarious, alive with detail and insight, A Prayer for the City describes a city on its knees and the rare combination of political courage and optimism that may be the only hope for America's urban centers.",0679744940,9780679744948),Paperback,,448 pages,"

","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From Jeff Shaara comes the riveting final installment in the Civil War series that began with A Blaze of Glory and continued in A Chain of Thunder and The Smoke at Dawn. November 1864: As the Civil War rolls into its fourth bloody year, the tide has turned decidedly in favor of the Union. A grateful Abraham Lincoln responds to Ulysses S. Grant’s successes by bringing the general east, promoting Grant to command the entire Union war effort, while William Tecumseh Sherman now directs the Federal forces that occupy all of Tennessee. In a massive surge southward, Sherman conquers the city of Atlanta, sweeping aside the Confederate army under the inept leadership of General John Bell Hood. Pushing through northern Georgia, Sherman’s legendary March to the Sea shoves away any Rebel presence, and by Christmas 1864 the city of Savannah falls into the hands of “Uncle Billy.” Now there is but one direction for Sherman to go. In his way stands the last great hope for the Southern cause, General Joseph E. Johnston. In the concluding novel of his epic Civil War tetralogy, Jeff Shaara tells the dramatic story of the final eight months of battle from multiple perspectives: the commanders in their tents making plans for total victory, as well as the ordinary foot soldiers and cavalrymen who carried out their orders until the last alarum sounded. Through Sherman’s eyes, we gain insight into the mind of the general who vowed to “make Georgia howl” until it surrendered. In Johnston, we see a man agonizing over the limits of his army’s power, and accepting the burden of leading the last desperate effort to ensure the survival of the Confederacy. The Civil War did not end quietly. It climaxed in a storm of fury that lay waste to everything in its path. The Fateful Lightning brings to life those final brutal, bloody months of fighting with you-are-there immediacy, grounded in the meticulous research that readers have come to expect from Jeff Shaara.",0345549198,9780345549198),Hardcover,,615 pages,"

","Jazz Jennings is one of the youngest and most prominent voices in the national discussion about gender identity. At the age of five, Jazz transitioned to life as a girl, with the support of her parents. A year later, her parents allowed her to share her incredible journey in her first Barbara Walters interview, aired at a time when the public was much less knowledgeable or accepting of the transgender community. This groundbreaking interview was followed over the years by other high-profile interviews, a documentary, the launch of her YouTube channel, a picture book, and her own reality TV series—I Am Jazz—making her one of the most recognizable activists for transgender teens, children, and adults. In her remarkable memoir, Jazz reflects on these very public experiences and how they have helped shape the mainstream attitude toward the transgender community. But it hasn’t all been easy. Jazz has faced many challenges, bullying, discrimination, and rejection, yet she perseveres as she educates others about her life as a transgender teen. Through it all, her family has been beside her on this journey, standing together against those who don't understand the true meaning of tolerance and unconditional love. Now Jazz must learn to navigate the physical, social, and emotional upheavals of adolescence—particularly high school—complicated by the unique challenges of being a transgender teen. Making the journey from girl to woman is never easy—especially when you began your life in a boy’s body.",0399554645,9780399554643),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","A masterpiece of modern fiction, James Joyce's semiautobiographical first novel follows Stephen Dedalus, a sensitive and creative youth who rebels against his family, his education, and his country by committing himself to the artist's life. ""I will not serve,"" vows Dedalus, ""that in which I no longer believe....and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can."" To Dedalus, the artist is like God—one who ""remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails."" Joyce's rendering of the impressions of childhood broke ground in the use of language. ""He took on the almost infinite English language,"" Jorge Luis Borges once said. ""He wrote in a language invented by himself....Joyce brought a new music to English.""

But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case.Special Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliché: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer.Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again - this time at them. Now on the run, trying to track down a man who has focused on killing his pursuers, Grady and Garrett will have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife.",,,Audible Audio,,14 pages,"

Suspecting that something is amiss with their father’s burial, teenager Kenneth Tyler and his sister Corrie venture to his gravesite and make a horrific discovery: their father, a whiskey bootlegger, was not actually buried in the casket they bought for him. Worse, they learn that the undertaker, Fenton Breece, has been grotesquely manipulating the dead.Armed with incriminating photographs, Tyler becomes obsessed with bringing the perverse undertaker to justice. But first, he must outrun Granville Sutter, a local strongman and convicted murderer hired by Fenton to destroy the evidence. What follows is an adventure through the Harrikin, an eerie backwoods filled with tangled roads, rusted machinery, and eccentric squatters–old men, witches, and families among them–who both shield and imperil Tyler as he runs for safety.

Agora, a trama sobre o casamento que sai tragicamente dos eixos chega aos cinemas, numa superprodução da Twentieth Century Fox dirigida por David Fincher (A rede social e Clube da luta) e estrelada por Ben Affleck e Rosamund Pike. O roteiro é assinado pela própria Gillian Flynn.O livro começa no dia do quinto aniversário de casamento de Nick e Amy Dunne, quando a linda e inteligente esposa de Nick desaparece da casa deles às margens do rio Mississippi. Sinais indicam que se trata de um sequestro violento e Nick rapidamente se torna o principal suspeito. Sob pressão da polícia, da mídia e dos ferozmente amorosos pais de Amy, Nick desfia uma série interminável de mentiras, meias verdades e comportamento inapropriado. Ele é evasivo e amargo — mas seria um assassino? Ao mesmo tempo, passagens do diário de Amy revelam um casamento tumultuado — mas ela estaria contando toda a história?Alternando entre os pontos de vista de Nick e Amy, Flynn cria uma aura de dúvidas em que o cenário muda a cada capítulo. À medida que as revelações surgem, fica claro que, se existe alguma verdade nos discursos de Nick e Amy, ela é mais sombria, distorcida e assustadora do que podemos imaginar. Magistralmente bem construído do início ao fim, Garota exemplar é um daqueles livros impossíveis de largar e sobre o qual se quer debater assim que a leitura termina.",8580576059,9788580576054),Paperback,,448 pages,"

Komentuje bieżące wydarzenia polityczne dotyczące Polski i jej miejsca w Europie oraz świecie. Styl pracy powoduje, iż ""Dzienniki"" są zapisem poszukiwania własnej tożsamości oraz sensu własnej indywidualności.",8308010067,9788308010068),Hardcover,,308 pages,"

Harold Klemp shows us there is something beyond the sun.He places the spiritual dream in its rightful place at the center of the whole subject of dreams. He shows you how to discover your dream's spiritual gold.Your dreams are real. Learn how dreams can help you gain insights from the past and future, grow in confidence, heal yourself spiritually, make decisions about your career and finances.

","Sally Porter is a drab waitress, divorcee, and loner in the great city. But, though she is unaware of it, she is also four other, quite different people: Nola, the cold independent artist who has a studio in Greenwich Village; Derry, the happy-go-lucky tomboy; Bella, the sexpot with a talent for singing and dancing; and finally Jinx, the hate- filled killer. Whenever events put too much of a strain on Sally Porter, she feels a headache and a blackout coming on -- and a new character takes over. If there is a man to be fascinated, she will become Bella. If there is an intellectual problem, she will become Nola. And -- as happens in the opening scene of the novel-- if there is a rapist to be dealt with, she becomes the vicious Jinx. It is the task of the wise and patient psychiatrist, Dr. Roger Ash -- a man who nevertheless has severe problems of his own -- to deal with this case of multiple personality and, through painstaking therapy, to try to fuse the four disparate personalities into ""the fifth Sally."" His struggle and near disasters become the major strand of the story. Sybil and The Three Faces of Eve were case histories dealing with multiple personality disorder. Although based on fact, this is the first contemporary novel, to deal with the theme as fiction.",0395294495,9780395294499),Hardcover,,278 pages,"

","When Selva, the daughter of one of the few remaining Ottoman Pashas, falls in love with Rafael, a young Jewish man, their families are against their marriage and disown them. Together they go to live in France, but happiness eludes them there too. With the advent of the Second World War they get caught up in Hitler's web of terror. While the Nazi grip tightens around them, they live with the fear of being rounded up and sent to a concentration camp.At the same time Turkey is desperately trying to avoid being drawn in to the war, walking the tightrope between the Axis and the Allies very carefully.In this new novel Ayse Kulin successfully follows through both the developments in her country during the war and the lives of Selva and Rafael in Europe. The story moves back and forth between Istanbul and Marseilles, Ankara and Cairo and Paris, to Berlin and back to Istanbul. In so doing it also highlights the courageous work of the Turkish diplomats who risked their lives to save hundreds of Jews stranded in Europe from being massacred by the Nazis.All of Ayse Kulin's novels are page turners and this one is no exception. It is a novel about love and escape, interwoven with the history of one of Europe's most tumultuous times.",9752893279,9789752893276),Paperback,,414 pages,"

","This is the incredible true story of how one man turned his life around through the companionship of his best friend. For years, John Dolan had been living rough, trying his best to get by. Born and bred on the estates of east London, his early life was marked by neglect and abuse, and his childhood gift for drawing was stamped out by the tough realities outside his front door. As he grew older, he found himself turning to petty crime to support himself and ended up in prison. On coming out, with a record and no trade, he soon found himself on the streets, surviving day-by-day, living hand-to-mouth. It wasn't until he met George, a tearaway Staffy puppy, that his life changed for the better. To begin with, George was a handful: he had been abused himself and was scared of human contact. But in a matter of weeks. John and George had become inseparable. It was then that John decided to pick up his long-forgotten gift for drawing, sitting on Shoreditch High Street for hours at a time, sketching pictures of George which he would sell to passers-by. With his best friend by his side, and a pencil in his hand, John suddenly found his life's calling. Last autumn, John put on his first gallery show just across the road from where he had sat and sketched for three years. It sold out. Now, John and George are no longer homeless and live just around the corner from where they first met on the streets.",1468311204,9781468311204),Hardcover,,320 pages,"

An artist, safecracker, practical joker and storyteller, Feynman's life was a series of combustoble combinations made possible by his unique mixture of high intelligence, unquenchable curiosity and eternal scepticism. Over a period of years, Feynman's conversations with his friend Ralph Leighton were first taped and then set down as they appear here, little changed from their spoken form, giving a wise, funny, passionate and totally honest self-portrait of one of the greatest men of our age.",0553256491,9780553256499),Mass Market Paperback,,322 pages,"

Faut-il choisir de porter le poids du passé sur ses épaules, comme Teresa qui ne peut se passer de la Tchécoslovaquie, qu'elle a pourtant fuie après le Printemps de Prague, de même qu'elle ne peut vivre sans Tomas, ce mari qu'elle chérit d'un amour jaloux et, par là, à jamais insatisfait ? Ou bien faut-il préférer à cette pesanteur la légèreté de l'être qui caractérise Tomas et Sabina, la maîtresse amie qui seule peut comprendre le médecin séducteur explorant les femmes comme s'il disséquait des objets d'étude au scalpel ? Ne sachant quelle orientation est la plus supportable, le roman offre tour à tour le regard des différents personnages. Même le chien Karénine a droit au chapitre.

","Pakistan may be making headlines—but Butterfly is set to conquer the world. ‘Everyone knows me. All of Lahore, all of Karachi, all of Isloo—oho, baba, Islamabad—half of Dubai, half of London and all of Khan Market and all the nice, nice bearers in Imperial Hotel also...No ball, no party, no dinner, no coffee morning, no funeral, no GT —Get-Together, baba—is complete without me.’ Meet Butterfly, Pakistan’s most lovable, silly, socialite. An avid partygoer, inspired misspeller, and unwittingly acute observer of Pakistani high society, Butterfly is a woman like no other. In her world, SMS becomes S & M and people eat ‘three tiara cakes’ while shunning ‘do number ka maal’. ‘What cheeks!’ as she would say. As her country faces tribulations – from 9/11 to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto—Butterfly glides through her world, unfazed, untouched, and stopped short only by the chip in her manicure. Wicked, irreverent, and hugely entertaining, The Diary of a Social Butterfly gives you a delicious glimpse into the parallel universe of the have-musts.",,,Kindle Edition,,240 pages,"

Gulwali Passarlay was sent away from Afghanistan at the age of twelve, after his father was killed in a gun battle with the US Army. Smuggled into Iran, Gulwali began a twelvemonth odyssey across Europe, spending time in prisons, suffering hunger, making a terrifying journey across the Mediterranean in a tiny boat, and enduring a desolate month in the camp at Calais. Somehow he survived, and made it to Britain, no longer an innocent child but still a young boy alone. In Britain he was fostered, sent to a good school, won a place at a top university, and was chosen to carry the Olympic torch in 2012. Gulwali wants to tell his story - to bring to life the plight of the thousands of men, women and children who are making this perilous journey every day. One boy's experience is the central story of our times. This memoir celebrates the triumph of courage and determination over adversity.",1782398473,9781782398479),Paperback,,365 pages,"

","Visit the author's Web site at www.ourinnerape.comIt’s no secret that humans and apes share a host of traits, from the tribal communities we form to our irrepressible curiosity. We have a common ancestor, scientists tell us, so it’s natural that we act alike. But not all of these parallels are so appealing: the chimpanzee, for example, can be as vicious and manipulative as any human.Yet there’s more to our shared primate heritage than just our violent streak. In Our Inner Ape, Frans de Waal, one of the world’s great primatologists and a renowned expert on social behavior in apes, presents the provocative idea that our noblest qualities—generosity, kindness, altruism—are as much a part of our nature as are our baser instincts. After all, we share them with another primate: the lesser-known bonobo. As genetically similar to man as the chimpanzee, the bonobo has a temperament and a lifestyle vastly different from those of its genetic cousin. Where chimps are aggressive, territorial, and hierarchical, bonobos are gentle, loving, and erotic (sex for bonobos is as much about pleasure and social bonding as it is about reproduction).While the parallels between chimp brutality and human brutality are easy to see, de Waal suggests that the conciliatory bonobo is just as legitimate a model to study when we explore our primate heritage. He even connects humanity’s desire for fairness and its morality with primate behavior, offering a view of society that contrasts markedly with the caricature people have of Darwinian evolution. It’s plain that our finest qualities run deeper in our DNA than experts have previously thought.Frans de Waal has spent the last two decades studying our closest primate relations, and his observations of each species in Our Inner Ape encompass the spectrum of human behavior. This is an audacious book, an engrossing discourse that proposes thought-provoking and sometimes shocking connections among chimps, bonobos, and those most paradoxical of apes, human beings.",,,Kindle Edition,,316 pages,"

","How to rewire your brain to improve virtually every aspect of your life-based on the latest research in neuroscience and psychology on neuroplasticity and evidence-based practices Not long ago, it was thought that the brain you were born with was the brain you would die with, and that the brain cells you had at birth were the most you would ever possess. Your brain was thought to be ""hardwired"" to function in predetermined ways. It turns out that's not true. Your brain is not hardwired, it's ""softwired"" by experience. This book shows you how you can rewire parts of the brain to feel more positive about your life, remain calm during stressful times, and improve your social relationships. Written by a leader in the field of Brain-Based Therapy, it teaches you how to activate the parts of your brain that have been underactivated and calm down those areas that have been hyperactivated so that you feel positive about your life and remain calm during stressful times. You will also learn to improve your memory, boost your mood, have better relationships, and get a good night sleep.Reveals how cutting-edge developments in neuroscience, and evidence-based practices can be used to improve your everyday life Other titles by Dr. Arden include: Brain-Based Therapy-Adult, Brain-Based Therapy-Child, Improving Your Memory For Dummies and Heal Your Anxiety WorkbookDr. Arden is a leader in integrating the new developments in neuroscience with psychotherapy and Director of Training in Mental Health for Kaiser Permanente for the Northern California Region Explaining exciting new developments in neuroscience and their applications to daily living, Rewire Your Brain will guide you through the process of changing your brain so you can change your life and be free of self-imposed limitations.",0470487291,9780470487297),Paperback,,243 pages,"

","14 hrs and 44 minsThe Blind Watchmaker, knowledgably narrated by author Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward, is as prescient and timely a book as ever. The watchmaker belongs to the 18th-century theologian William Paley, who argued that just as a watch is too complicated and functional to have sprung into existence by accident, so too must all living things, with their far greater complexity, be purposefully designed. Charles Darwin's brilliant discovery challenged the creationist arguments; but only Richard Dawkins could have written this elegant riposte. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process Darwin discovered - is the blind watchmaker in nature.©1986, 1987, 1996 Richard Dawkins (P)2011 Audible, Inc.",,,Audible Audio,Unabridged Audiobook,15 pages,"

When the documentary crew offers her a way forward, a bridge to another kind of life, she takes it. But while Solomon knows the world will love Laura, will it free her to spread her wings – or will it trap her in a gilded cage?

","Based on unproduced scripts from the blockbuster TV show Star Wars: The Clone Wars!The only way to bring down the dark side's most dangerous warrior may be for Jedi and Sith to join forces.In the war for control of the galaxy between the armies of the dark side and the Republic, former Jedi Master turned ruthless Sith Lord Count Dooku has grown ever more brutal in his tactics. Despite the powers of the Jedi and the military prowess of their clone army, the sheer number of fatalities is taking a terrible toll. And when Dooku orders the massacre of a flotilla of helpless refugees, the Jedi Council feels it has no choice but to take drastic action: targeting the man responsible for so many war atrocities, Count Dooku himself.But the ever-elusive Dooku is dangerous prey for even the most skilled hunter. So the Council makes the bold decision to bring both sides of the Force's power to bear—pairing brash Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos with infamous one-time Sith acolyte Asajj Ventress. Though Jedi distrust for the cunning killer who once served at Dooku's side still runs deep, Ventress's hatred for her former master runs deeper. She's more than willing to lend her copious talents as a bounty hunter—and assassin—to Vos's quest.Together, Ventress and Vos are the best hope for eliminating Dooku—as long as the emerging feelings between them don't compromise their mission. But Ventress is determined to have her retribution and at last let go of her dark Sith past. Balancing the complicated emotions she feels for Vos with the fury of her warrior's spirit, she resolves to claim victory on all fronts—a vow that will be mercilessly tested by her deadly enemy . . . and her own doubt.",,,Paperback,,336 pages,"

","In a world where magic is real and evil walks amongst humanity, a young sorcerer is beset upon by enemies, both old and new. Angelus Salvatore is the only necromancer in all of Boston, and his name is whispered warily by the undead and fellow sorcerers alike. He and his brother Isaac are the lone survivors of an attack by an army of the undead, in which Angel used a spell so powerful it forever marked his place in history. Now, years later, Angel struggles to balance his career as a teacher of the higher magical arts, his role as big brother, and a tenuous relationship with an Elder vampire from the local clan. When his brother’s boyfriend is used as a pawn in a mysterious plot to draw Angel out, Angel is once again pulled back into the old hostilities that fueled the Blood Wars and led to his family’s death.Leaning on others for help is something Angel cannot do, and while he searches for clues into who may be targeting him and his brother, Angel finds his heart steadily growing occupied with Simeon, Elder and vampire. Dealing with death magic and vampires on a daily basis may leave Angel jaded when it comes to life and staying that way, but the more time he spends fending off the ancient vampire’s attention and affections, the more he realizes he wants to give in.Can Angel find out who wants him dead, and keep his heart safe in the process?

","Librarian note: Older cover of 9781853260414.The exemplary novel of the Jazz Age, F. Scott Fitzgeralds' third book, The Great Gatsby (1925), stands as the supreme achievement of his career. T. S. Eliot read it three times and saw it as the ""first step"" American fiction had taken since Henry James; H. L. Mencken praised ""the charm and beauty of the writing,"" as well as Fitzgerald's sharp social sense; and Thomas Wolfe hailed it as Fitzgerald's ""best work"" thus far. The story of the fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan, of lavish parties on Long Island at a time when, The New York Times remarked, ""gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession,"" it is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s that resonates with the power of myth.

Reilly of New Orleans, noble crusader against a world of dunces. The ordinary folk of New Orleans seem to think he is unhinged. Ignatius ignores them, heaving his vast bulk through the city's fleshpots in a noble crusade against vice, modernity and ignorance. But his momma has a nasty surprise in store for him: Ignatius must get a job. Undaunted, he uses his new-found employment to further his mission - and now he has a pirate costume and a hot-dog cart to do it with...John Kennedy Toole (1937-1969) was born in New Orleans. He received a master's degree in English from Columbia University and taught at Hunter College and at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. He wrote A Confederacy of Dunces in the early sixties and tried unsuccessfully to get the novel published; depressed, at least in part by his failure to place the book, he committed suicide in 1969. It was only through the tenacity of his mother that her son's book was eventually published and found the audience it deserved, winning the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. His long-suppressed novel The Neon Bible, written when he was only sixteen, was eventually published as well.If you enjoyed A Confederacy of Dunces, you might like Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'A pungent work of slapstick, satire and intellectual incongruities ... it is nothing less than a grand comic fugue'The New York Times",0141182865,9780141182865),Paperback,Penguin Modern Classics,338 pages,"

If you lost your body to science and your creator rejects you, do you even stand a chance at living? 


An innocent family is slain, a new body is mutilated and the Virginia Corp. opens a contract with a nefarious organization known as Monarch Enterprises to have Savannah executed. Savannah’s railings against the moral deficiencies of the Virginia Corp. make her a target for assassination, a realization that leads her to something far worse than even she could imagine: the horrifying truth about her body and what Dr. Gerhard really did to it.To preserve their anonymity, Savannah and her father rid themselves of the Van Duyn namesake. Savannah’s body however—the thing she treasures most—is being systematically eviscerated while Gerhard refuses to fix her. Desperate to survive, her body swiftly decomposing, Savannah leans on skills she learned from Astor when blackmailing Gerhard, a sadist who closely resembles the infamous war criminal and deceased Auschwitz death camp doctor, Josef Mengele.

If she survives Gerhard and returns to Astor, Savannah will neither look the same nor carry the same name. How will she find her friends if everyone changed everything about themselves? For this mystery within a mystery, our heroine enlists the help of smart-ass hacker turned bad boy, Brayden James. In Swann series fashion, things are not as they seem. Ideals are challenged, victims become bullies and one life may be lost forever. However, through intellect, determination and the perseverance of friendship, Savannah and her friends continue to evolve, bringing to light a most poignant of truths: we are who we decide to be, but that doesn’t guarantee our survival.


Due to mature content, Monarch is recommended for ages 15 and up.



INTERVIEW WITH THE AUTHOR



Q – How do I get 

Vannie, 

The Swann series prequel, when it’s not listed on Amazon?
A – Inside Monarch or at the author’s website, you’ll find a link to download the FREE prequel. Vannie is an engaging read, a 47 page novella that can be enjoyed in a single sitting before or after Monarch, although you’ll probably like the series even more if you start with Vannie.


Q – What makes the Swann series special?
A – I remember devouring the Harry Potter books thinking there was always something thrilling about each new adventure. The kinds of literary highs these stories inspire produce a feeling like no other! We’ve seen vampires, werewolves, angels, demons and tales from the dystopian future; I desperately wanted to tap into the next evolution of the young adult fiction genre! From this mindset, the Swann series was born…

","Sáu Người Đi Khắp Thế Gian, như cái tên đã chuyển tải, là một cuộc hành trình của những kẻ lang bạt, hơn thế, là hành trình của những con người miệt mài trên những chặng đường vô tận để tìm cho mình một nơi dừng chân. Sáu con người, Joe, Cato, Yigal, Gretchen, Britta và Monica, là sáu mảnh đời, sáu số phận. Điểm chung duy nhất giữa họ chính là đều đang chạy trốn hiện tại đầy hỗn loạn.Và thế là câu chuyện được kể lại, thông qua một ông già ít nhiều quen biết cả sáu người, quen biết cả những gì họ chối bỏ, những gì họ muốn thoát khỏi để dấn thân vào cuộc du hành với đầy đủ mọi góc cạnh của cuộc sống đương thời. Sức mạnh, cám dỗ, cảm xúc, nhục cảm, buông thả, thương tổn... mọi trạng thái tinh thần hiện lên trong trang sách thông qua hình ảnh của những kẻ bỏ xứ để trôi dạt vô định.Sáu Người Đi Khắp Thế Gian có bóng dáng của một thiên tiểu thuyết sử thi khi lồng ghép nhiều câu chuyện vào một, tái hiện lại những khung cảnh thông qua cách kể vừa như tường thuật, vừa như nhìn thấu mà lại vừa như chiêm nghiệm.Sau cùng, Sáu Người Đi Khắp Thế Gian là hành trình vô tận con người tìm kiếm chính mình, tìm kiếm một nơi mình thuộc về dù hành trình ấy có khi kết thúc trong một cái kết hoàn hảo nhưng có khi để ngỏ vô định và mờ mịt.©Họ là bốn người Mỹ, một cô gái Na Uy, một cô gái Anh. Chiến tranh Việt Nam, chiến tranh Trung Đông, nạn phân biệt chủng tộc, đạo Hồi và những bóng ma của quá khứ đã xô đẩy họ trôi dạt tới thành phố mặt trời, để rồi, từ nơi đây, họ lại bắt đầu hành trình phiêu lưu mới đến với những đêm phương Nam Tây Ban Nha vò xé tâm can, những trận đấu bò rừng ngàn cân treo sợi tóc, những thành lũy Bồ Đào Nha thách thức thời gian, những rừng rậm châu Phi đầy ám ảnh, những bão táp cuộc đời và những tan vỡ trong lòng người… Không tìm bất cứ góc cạnh nào để ẩn náu, họ đã cùng nhau đối diện với cuộc đời trong cuộc Thập Tự Chinh kiếm tìm những giá trị mới…Như một bách khoa thư kết hợp nhuần nhuyễn súng ống và hoa hồng, tình yêu và tình dục, tôn giáo và nghệ thuật, du hành và ma túy, những bản ballad say lòng và tiếng kêu thầm xé ruột, có thể nói Sáu người đi khắp thế gian là một cuốn tiểu thuyết độc nhất vô nhị không bao giờ cũ về cuộc sống…",,,Paperback,,344 pages,"

","A sudden discovery, eight years into marriage with his childhood sweetheart, reveals that what Eli Sorensson thought was the path to ""happily ever after"" was really just a dead end. Seeking to get as far away from the scene of his humiliation as possible, he accepts a transfer to the Pink City of Jaipur — entering the contradictions of India's growing economic power with its ancient and stubborn traditions. Eli is determined to live in the future, and to ""live in truth"". He has had enough of sentiment and romance. But, as he steps into the flow of India culture and life, he finds his re-invention to be much more difficult than he had planned — the past is hard to shake — and he feels the lure of romance once again.

But as both a writer and an African American, he is offended and angered by the success of We's Lives in Da Ghetto, the exploitative debut novel of a young, middle-class black woman who once visited ""some relatives in Harlem for a couple of days."" Hailed as an authentic representation of the African American experience, the book is a national bestseller and its author feted on the Kenya Dunston television show. The book's success rankles all the more as Monk's own most recent novel has just notched its seventh rejection."" ""Even as his career as a writer appears to have stalled, Monk finds himself coping with changes in his personal life. In need of distraction from old memories, new responsibilities, and his professional stagnation, Monk composes, in a heat of inspiration and energy, a fierce parody of the sort of exploitative, ghetto wanna-be lit represented by We's Lives in Da Ghetto."" But when his agent sends this literary indictment (included here in its entirety) out to publishers, it is greeted as an authentic new voice of black America. Monk - or his pseudonymous alter ego, Stagg R. Leigh - is offered money, fame, success beyond anything he has known. And as demand begins to build for meetings with and appearances by Leigh, Monk is faced with a whole new set of problems.",0786888156,9780786888153),Paperback,Reprint,280 pages,"

","Inspector Alan Grant searches for the identity of a man killed in the line at a theater and for the identity of the killer—whom no one saw.A long line had formed for the standing-room-only section of the Woffington Theatre. London’s favorite musical comedy of the past two years was finishing its run at the end of the week. Suddenly, the line began to move, forming a wedge before the open doors as hopeful theatergoers nudged their way forward. But one man, his head sunk down upon his chest, slowly sank to his knees and then, still more slowly, keeled over on his face. Thinking he had fainted, a spectator moved to help, but recoiled in horror from what lay before him: the man in the queue had a small silver dagger neatly plunged into his back. With the wit and guile that have made Inspector Grant a favorite of mystery fans, the inspector sets about discovering just how a murder occurred among so many witnesses, none of whom saw a thing.",0684815028,9780684815022),Paperback,,255 pages,"

","Debiut prozatorski Mariusza Wilka, mieszkającego od kilku lat na Sołowkach. Tematem jest współczesna Rosja, której wizerunek autor kreśli w sposób rzetelny i barwny zarazem. ""Na Sołowkach – pisze – widać Rosję, jak w kropli wody – morze"". Z okazji wydania Wilczego notesu Jerzy Giedroyc pisał: ""Mariusz Wilk rewelował się nie tylko jako świetny pisarz, ale też jako wyjątkowy znawca Rosji. Jego zapiski dają wnikliwy obraz współczesnej Rosji, jej kultury i tradycji"". Wilczy notes nie jest bowiem fikcją literacką, lecz relacją o zdarzeniach, których autor był świadkiem. Fabularyzowane fragmenty książki ujawniają jednak również talent powieściopisarski Wilka, wspaniałego stylisty. ""Uderza i zachwyca – pisał Jan Kott – jędrność, bogactwo i nade wszystko świeżość języka. W języku Wilka wiatr z północy przynosi i odnawia słowa"". Zarówno postać autora, jak i wybitne walory literackie Wilczego notesu oraz poruszony w nim temat sprawiły, że książka szybko wzbudziła zainteresowanie czytelników i krytyki, stając się nie tylko najgoręcej komentowanym, ale i najbardziej kontrowersyjnym debiutem prozatorskim ostatnich lat. Wokół Wilczego notesu rozgorzał dawno u nas niespotykany spór literacki, w którym głos zabrali między innymi tak znani pisarze, jak Stanisław Lem, Gustaw Herling-Grudziński, Andrzej Stasiuk i Jerzy Pilch.",8387316865,9788387316860),Hardcover,,250 pages,"

","Hero to Zero?   John Luke Legacy thought his life was moving along right on track. He was in line for a promotion, his love life wasn't bad and he had a great relationship with his son. Then he learned the truth about his family and everything changed. He did what he thought was right and hoped he wasn't making a huge mistake.   Ex is an ugly word.   Not only is he an ex-husband, now he's an ex-agent with the FBI. And when he tells his girlfriend that he quit the Bureau, he's also an ex-boyfriend. He has little choice. There's nowhere to go but home. That’s depressing, but at least he will be closer to his son.   Illiana.   She’s as exotic as her name. All woman and all warrior. Illiana is no shy flower. She’s a handful. Actually more. Big, strong and fearless, she inspires desire that surpasses anything he’s ever felt. But it’s more than passion. Illiana inspires emotions he didn’t think himself capable of. 
 But things are not what they seem. 
  John Luke discovers that his view of the world up until now has been surprisingly naïve. There are things going on that make fantasy tales seem tame. And there are people that make him understand just how those fairy tales began. Like Illiana. 
 Lust and love walk hand-in-hand 
  She’s going to teach him about a level of passion he didn’t know he possessed and a depth of love he didn’t dream he was capable of. He sees a future he wants more than anything.  Now all he has to do is keep her alive to claim it and it won’t be easy because those who want her dead will stop at nothing and their numbers are many.

","An alternate cover edition can be found here.There’s a single defining moment within every skater. It lasts only a second. Two if you're good. Three if you’re really good. It’s the moment you’re in the air, your board somewhere beneath you, and nothing but wind surrounds you. It’s the feeling of being airborne.  The sixteen-year-old version of me would’ve said it was the greatest feeling in the world. Then at seventeen, I had my son. And every single second became a defining moment. Even the ones that consisted of heartbreak when his mother left us.  Seventeen. Single. Dad. That’s what my life became. Yet, every day, I managed to find that feeling of being airborne. Or at least I convinced myself I did. But I lied—to myself and to everyone around me. Until she showed up; Tanned skin, raven dark hair, and eyes the color of emeralds.  You know what sucks about being in the air? Coming down from the high. Sometimes you land on the board and nail the trick. Then kick, push, and coast away. Other times you fall. You fall hard. And those are the times when it’s not as easy to get back up, dust off your pads and try again. Especially when the girl with the emerald eyes becomes your drug...

","With Dusk (originally published in the Philippines as Po-on), F. Sionil Jose begins his five-novel Rosales Saga, which the poet and critic Ricaredo Demetillo called ""the first great Filipino novels written in English."" Set in the 1880s, Dusk records the exile of a tenant family from its village and the new life it attempts to make in the small town of Rosales. Here commences the epic tale of a family unwillingly thrown into the turmoil of history. But this is more than a historical novel; it is also the eternal story of man's tortured search for true faith and the larger meaning of existence. Jose has achieved a fiction of extraordinary scope and passion, a book as meaningful to Philippine literature as One Hundred Years of Solitude is to Latin American literature.",0375751440,9780375751448),Paperback,The Modern Library,325 pages,"

","Though more than sixty years have passed since this remarkable novel won the Pulitzer Prize, it has retained its popularity and become one of the great modern classics. ""I can only write what I know, and I know nothing but China, having always lived there,"" wrote Pearl Buck. In The Good Earth she presents a graphic view of a China when the last emperor reigned and the vast political and social upheavals of the twentieth century were but distant rumblings for the ordinary people. This moving, classic story of the honest farmer Wang Lung and his selfless wife O-lan is must reading for those who would fully appreciate the sweeping changes that have occurred in the lives of the Chinese people during this century.Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck traces the whole cycle of life: its terrors, its passions, its ambitions and rewards.

","""I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer . . . Why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?"" Haunted by the myth of Cupid and Psyche throughout his life, C.S. Lewis wrote this, his last, extraordinary novel, to retell their story through the gaze of Psyche's sister, Orual. Disfigured and embittered, Orual loves her younger sister to a fault and suffers deeply when she is sent away to Cupid, the God of the Mountain. Psyche is forbidden to look upon the god's face, but is persuaded by her sister to do so; she is banished for her betrayal. Orual is left alone to grow in power but never in love, to wonder at the silence of the gods. Only at the end of her life, in visions of her lost beloved sister, will she hear an answer. ""Till We Have Faces succeeds in presenting with imaginative directness what its author has described elsewhere as 'the divine, magical, terrifying and ecstatic reality in which we all live' . . . [It] deepens for adults that sense of wonder and strange truth which delights children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and other legends of Narnia."" --New York Times ""The most significant and triumphant work that Lewis has . . . produced."" --New York Herald Tribune",0547564066,9780547564067),ebook,,324 pages,"

","In its marvelously perceptive portrayal of two young women in love, Sense and Sensibility is the answer to those who believe that Jane Austen’s novels, despite their perfection of form and tone, lack strong feeling. Its two heroines, Marianne and Elinor—so utterly unlike each other–both undergo the most violent passions when they are separated from the men they love. What differentiates them, and gives this extraordinary book its complexity and brilliance, is the way each expresses her suffering: Marianne–young, impetuous, ardent–falls into paroxysms of grief when she is rejected by the dashing John Willoughby; while her sister, Elinor—wiser, more sensible, more self-controlled—masks her despair when it appears that Edward Ferrars is to marry the mean-spirited and cunning Lucy Steele. All, of course, ends happily—but not until Elinor’s “sense” and Marianne’s “sensibility” have equally worked to reveal the profound emotional life that runs beneath the surface of Austen’s immaculate and irresistible art.(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)",0679409874,9780679409878),Hardcover,"Everyman's Library Classics, #51",367 pages,"

If the Seventine are released, will anyone survive?Abigail Swish might not love her life, living in gang-ridden New York in 2035 and training to fight and survive with Compound 23. But she is grateful for a few things, especially her no-filter-between-brain-and-mouth best friend Lucy and her escape each night into a dream world far different from her own. In fact, sometimes she lives for the fleeting moments she spends at night with the man who fuels every romantic fantasy she’s ever had. But each morning reality returns. She could just cry. But she won’t of course; tears don’t change a damn thing.Then without any warning, a month before her eighteenth birthday, everything does change. A guardian finds her. He explains, in a strangely familiar accent, that she was stashed on Earth for safekeeping and has been lost to her family ever since. And it is time to return home. To the First World; a land of unimagined beauty. Abigail and Lucy find themselves escaping New York, ending up on another planet and traversing through an unforgiving wilderness. Yeah, because that sort of thing just happens every day. Luckily an unexpected saviour arrives; the man from her dream-world. Brace is six-and-a-half feet of gorgeous perfectness, wrapped in an arrogance like no other. Unable to trust his assistance, and unsure which of her instincts to follow - kiss him or punch him in the mouth - Abigail eventually accepts his help to find her family. And what a family. Enter Josian, her father; larger than life and apparently not even human. He is Walker, a planet-less race revered as gods, causing mischief and mayhem through-out this star-system. Unfortunately, there is no time for a cosy reunion, since no one explained that by returning to First World her half-Walker genetics would act as a catalyst setting forth a chain of events which could spell disaster for not only her existence but that of all worlds.First World is book one in the Walker Saga, a seven-book paranormal fantasy series.Spurn - A Walker Saga Book Two release date set for September 2013.",1490960481,9781490960487),Paperback,1st,290 pages,"

","After years of study in Europe, the young narrator of Season of Migration to the North returns to his village along the Nile in the Sudan. It is the 1960s, and he is eager to make a contribution to the new postcolonial life of his country. Back home, he discovers a stranger among the familiar faces of childhood—the enigmatic Mustafa Sa’eed. Mustafa takes the young man into his confidence, telling him the story of his own years in London, of his brilliant career as an economist, and of the series of fraught and deadly relationships with European women that led to a terrible public reckoning and his return to his native land.But what is the meaning of Mustafa’s shocking confession? Mustafa disappears without explanation, leaving the young man—whom he has asked to look after his wife—in an unsettled and violent no-man’s-land between Europe and Africa, tradition and innovation, holiness and defilement, and man and woman, from which no one will escape unaltered or unharmed.Season of Migration to the North is a rich and sensual work of deep honesty and incandescent lyricism.

Вторият му син, принц Джем, ерудиран, образован и опитен военен, подтикнат от спахиите и обкръжението си, оспорва тази власт и предлага на брат си да си поделят империята. Баязид отхвърля предложението и между двамата братя възниква безмилостна вражда. За Джем започва дълги години на странстване в изгнание. Подхвърлян от различните политически интереси на управляващите в Европа, заложник по неволя, разменна монета между Изтока и Запада, който се стреми да забави възхода на Изтока и дори да завземе отново Цариград, Джем спира в Сирия, Египет, Родос, Франция, Рим, където е задържан от папа Инокентий VIII, преди да бъде предаден на краля на Франция Шарл VIII. Умира в Неапол през 1495 г. при тайнствени обстоятелства.Основното значение на този необичаен роман е в избрания ъгъл за водене на повествованието и новото за епохата послание. Романът е конструиран като съд на историята, пред който се явяват повече от десет преки свидетели на този случай, второстепенни герои от близкото обкръжение на Джем, като покровителствания от него поет Саади или леля му, но и исторически личности – великият везир Нишанджи Мехмед, д'Обюсон, велик магистър на родоските рицари, и много други.Тази форма позволява постоянна съпоставка между минало и настояще, доколкото свидетелите, отдавна покойници, в повествователен план са разказвачи, които предлагат на читателя мнението си за историята, а гледната им точка (зад която стои авторът) става съвременна на тази на читателя (стоящ зад обръщението „вие” и в ролята на съдебен състав на въображаемия съд); по този начин се установява истински диалог между минало и настояще.

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewJanuary 1998 Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa is the story of Peter Godwin's experiences growing up in Rhodesia. He recounts the story of that country's violent transformation into Zimbabwe, as well as his own personal metamorphoses from privileged boy to reluctant soldier to investigative journalist. Godwin's story begins, ""I think I first realized something was wrong when our next door neighbor, Oom Piet Oberholzer, was murdered. I must have been about five then. It was still five years before the real war would start."" The Godwins enjoyed a typical genteel existence in 1960 rural Rhodesia, their household including a ""garden boy,"" a ""cook boy,"" and a nanny. Peter's father managed a wood- and sugarcane-processing plant. His mother, a rural government doctor, was often called to pronounce deaths or conduct autopsies, for which she brought along her ""assistant,"" five-year-old Peter, who was responsible for shooing away the flies. Godwin's plans for attending college were squashed when he was drafted into the Rhodesian army and assigned to the ""Anti-Terrorist Unit,"" which proved to be an important experience in his life. When he later looked at himself, he saw a man ""coursed through with anger and despair. It was the face of someone who would kill an unarmed civilian for withholding information."" Disturbed by what he had become, Godwin left Rhodesia after he got out of the army, only to return in 1981 as a journalist. Rhodesia was now Zimbabwe, and the ""terrorists"" he had reluctantly fought against were now the country's rulers. Godwin reported on theutterbrutalities in Zimbabwe and the fate of Matabeleland, a black minority region in Zimbabwe. He described the army style of interrogation, in which ""before they even began to question you, they would break one wrist,"" and wrote about the old mines where bodies of the dead were buried. When Godwin's writings received worldwide attention, the Zimbabwean government tried to discredit him, and he received numerous death threats, escaping the country just hours before the police came looking for him. Mukiwa is not only a memoir but also a compelling adventure story that tells a personal saga that needs to be heard. ",0802141927,9780802141927),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","An ancient secret brotherhood.A devastating new weapon of destruction.An unthinkable target... When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol -- seared into the chest of a murdered physicist -- he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati... the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has surfaced from the shadows to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy... the Catholic Church. Langdon's worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the Vatican's holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces he has hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even to the heart of the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair... a secret location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.

","""Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.""With this proclamation of redemption, newly released prisoner Jean Valjean embarks on the path of virtue, and a classic of world literature soars. Les Misérables is the story of Jean Valjean's transformation from criminal to hero, and his dedication to doing good in a world where harsh laws often thwart the most benevolent impulses. Imprisoned for nineteen years after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving family, Valjean is on track to become a repeat offender until a charitable bishop's act of pity compels him to transform into an honest man.Over the next two decades, Valjean becomes a successful businessman and a generous benefactor to is orphan ward, Cosette. But the implacable Inspector Javert, who knows of Valjean's criminal past and who enforces the law mercilessly, hounds him from town to town, seeking to apply a standard of justice that does not acknowledge either rehabilitation or renewal.A vivid historical romance whose events climax spectacularly during the Paris Uprising of 1832, Les Misérables was praised by Upton Sinclair as ""one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world."" This unabridged edition of Victor Hugo's classic work is as stirring a tale of adventure today as it was when first published in 1862.",1435144775,9781435144774),Hardcover,,908 pages,"

","Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Originally published in 1890, this classic of modern literature follows an impoverished Norwegian writer through the streets of Christiania (now Olso) as he struggles on the edge of starvation. Existing on what little money he makes from selling the occasional article to the local paper, and down to pawning the clothes on his back, the young writer slowly loses control of his reason and begins to slip increasingly into bouts of madness, paranoia, and despair.A gripping portrait of an artist struggling for integrity, Hunger mirrors the dire straits of Hamsun's own life when he brought this, his then incomplete first novel, to a publisher in 1888.--back cover",0374525285,9780374525286),Paperback,Revised Edition,243 pages,"

","Based on a true story that stunned the world, M. Butterfly opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government - and by his own illusions. In the darkness of his cell he recalls a time when desire seemed to give him wings. A time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive - and as elusive - as a butterfly.How could he have known, then, that his ideal woman was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government - and a man disguised as a woman? In a series of flashbacks, the diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both. But in the end, there remains only one truth: Whether or not Gallimard's passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life.Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress - as well as his jailer. M. Butterfly is one of the most compelling, explosive, and slyly humorous dramas ever to light the Broadway stage, a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes - and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.",0822207125,9780822207122),Paperback,Acting Edition,93 pages,"

Set in 1820s imperial Russia, Pushkin's novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop, Lensky the minor elegiast, and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty, her sister Olga, and Pushkin's mercurial Muse. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the listener many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from a romantic poet into a realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem's spontaneity and wit.©1990, 1995 James E.

","A New York Times Bestseller: “Astonishing . . . has the makings of a classic—and one fantastic read.”—PeopleWhat separates your mind from an animal’s? Maybe you think it’s your ability to design tools, your sense of self, or your grasp of past and future—all traits that have helped us define ourselves as the planet’s preeminent species. But in recent decades, these claims have eroded, or even been disproven outright, by a revolution in the study of animal cognition. Take the way octopuses use coconut shells as tools; elephants that classify humans by age, gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash memory puts that of humans to shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps, bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth of animal intelligence. He offers a firsthand account of how science has stood traditional behaviorism on its head by revealing how smart animals really are, and how we’ve underestimated their abilities for too long.People often assume a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own intelligence at the top. But what if it is more like a bush, with cognition taking different forms that are often incomparable to ours? Would you presume yourself dumber than a squirrel because you’re less adept at recalling the locations of hundreds of buried acorns? Or would you judge your perception of your surroundings as more sophisticated than that of a echolocating bat? De Waal reviews the rise and fall of the mechanistic view of animals and opens our minds to the idea that animal minds are far more intricate and complex than we have assumed. De Waal’s landmark work will convince you to rethink everything you thought you knew about animal—and human—intelligence.",,,Kindle Edition,,353 pages,"

But the closer the villagers look, the stranger it becomes. Given to Armand Gamache as a gift the first day of his new job, the map eventually leads him to shattering secrets. To an old friend and older adversary. It leads the former Chief of Homicide for the Sûreté du Québec to places even he is afraid to go. But must. And there he finds four young cadets in the Sûreté academy, and a dead professor. And, with the body, a copy of the old, odd map. Everywhere Gamache turns, he sees Amelia Choquet, one of the cadets.

","New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker possesses that rare combination of scientific aptitude and verbal eloquence that enables him to provide lucid explanations of deep and powerful ideas. His previous books, including the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Blank Slate, have catapulted him into the limelight as one of today's most important and popular science writers.  Now, in The Stuff of Thought, Pinker marries two of the subjects he knows best: language and human nature. The result is a fascinating look at how our words explain our nature. What does swearing reveal about our emotions? Why does innuendo disclose something about relationships? Pinker reveals how our use of prepositions and tenses taps into peculiarly human concepts of space and time, and how our nouns and verbs speak to our notions of matter. Even the names we give our babies have important things to say about our relations to our children and to society.  With his signature wit and style, Pinker takes on scientific questions like whether language affects thought, as well as forays into everyday life: why is bulk e-mail called spam and how do romantic comedies get such mileage out of the ambiguities of dating? The Stuff of Thought is a brilliantly crafted and highly readable work that will appeal to fans of readers of everything from The Selfish Gene and Blink to Eats, Shoots & Leaves.",0670063274,9780670063277),Hardcover,,499 pages,"

","STEP INTO THE FOLD. IT’S PERFECTLY SAFE.  The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn’t much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he’s content with his quiet and peaceful existence.   That is, until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve: far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to “fold” dimensions, it shrinks distances so that a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind’s dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the Door is completely safe.  Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn’t quite what it seems—and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret.  As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there’s only one answer that makes sense. And if he’s right, it may only be a matter of time before the project destroys…everything.  A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you’ll never see coming, The Fold is that rarest of things: a genuinely page-turning science-fiction thriller.

В книгата, силно въздействуваща преди всичко с фактите и особено популярна благодарение на екранизацията й (с Ал Пачино в главната роля), се изобличава безпринципността на тези, чийто дълг е да преследват закононарушителите, разкрива се покварата сред т.нар. „пазители на реда“. С реални факти, данни, дати, цифри и имена са описани ред скандални афери на висши и нисши полицейски служители.

","""It's like Buffy on steroids."" - Benjaminoftomes, YouTubeMy blood is toxic to vampires . . .If there's one thing I want, it's go get off this iceberg. I'm thinking college on the east coast. ANYWHERE besides Alaska. Then a near-fatal car wreck changes everything. Government agents jump in and save my life in exchange for my services as a vampire hunter. Did they just say vampires? Yep. And they're not the kind that sparkle. They're rabid, disgusting, rude . . . and way too suave. Those are the ones I really have to watch out for.A knife isn't my only weapon. My rare blood type sends vampires into temporary paralysis right before I have to finish the job by hand. Basically I'm a glorified chew toy.Now I'm stuck with an overzealous partner, a group of suck junkies, and a maddening attraction to Mr. Joe Cool, dresses all in black, Fane Donado. I don't know if I want to punch him or kiss him, but clearly he's keeping secrets of his own. The old Aurora is gone forever. Destroyed in the wreckage. I don’t know who I am anymore, only that I suddenly have intense cravings and a V.I.P. pass into Alaska’s underworld. If vampires found out who I worked for it would be lights out forever. In the meantime, I have some undead ass to kick so long as it doesn't kick mine first.",,,Paperback,,242 pages,"

","Dos mil años sin sentir nada son demasiados, incluso para un inmortal como Cahal McCloud. En el pasado, los dioses Vanir lo castigaron por violar las leyes y lo relegaron a una eternidad sin emociones, convirtiéndolo en un crisol vacío, hasta que encontrara a su pareja de vida y esta le devolviese todo lo perdido. Pero nunca imaginó que su cáraid estaría de parte de Loki y sus jotuns, que lo secuestraría y lo torturaría durante interminables y agónicos días. Ahora, por fin, las tornas se han cambiado, y es la científica quién está a su merced. Su sangre le dará un enorme poder, el druida en él despertará y su secreto don será requerido en la lucha contra Lucius y Newscientists, pero nada le importará más al vanirio que vengarse de su verruga. Aunque su alma esté eternamente atada a la de él, aunque los destruya a los dos, llevará a cabo su cometido hasta las últimas consecuencias. Él no se pudo proteger de ella, ahora nadie la podrá proteger de él.La científica no entiende lo mucho que a cambiado su visión de la realidad en tan poco tiempo. Ella creyó que trabajan para los buenos, pensó que sus conocimientos se hacían servir para erradicar el mal. Pero estaba equivocada. La engañaron vilmente. Aquellos que creía que eran sus amigos, son sus enemigos; y ahora ese rubio tan hermoso a quien ella había maltratado, que afirma no ser un vampiro, la ha secuestrada, y la quiere forzar a entrar en su mundo nocturno de un modo cruel y autoritario, obligándola a aceptar cosas de ella misma que ni siquiera sabía y forzándola a revelar una información que sólo ella sabe. La joven luchará por mantener vida su esencia, por salvaguardar el descubrimiento que Lucius y Newscientists anhelan saber, y peleará sobre todo por mantener en pie las murallas que resguardan a su corazón. Aunque el vanirio las dinamite.Todavía no se han recuperado todos los tótems, la profecía del noaiti encaja sus piezas, Heimdal ha desaparecido y es urgente dar con él, Lucios ambiciona el conocimiento de su ex científica y vanirios y berserkers harán de tripas corazón para proteger a la fría mujer del druida del clan keltoi.",,,Paperback,,512 pages,"

","In questo che è uno degli ultimi suoi dialoghi, Platone sottopone a una severa critica la propria dottrina delle idee confrontandola con le posizioni di Zenone e di Parmenide. Zenone sostiene l'impossibilità dell'esistenza del molteplice, confermando la tesi di Parmenide secondo la quale solo l'Uno, immutabile ed eterno, esiste. Socrate obietta che quanto sostiene Zenone è errato, in quanto si limita solo all'ambito del molteplice sensibile e non a quello del molteplice ideale. Parmenide interviene ammettendo la validità delle affermazioni di Socrate, ma facendo notare come sia impossibile accettare il molteplice anche nel mondo delle idee, in quanto l'idea di uomo riassume una molteplicità infinita di uomini.",8817001562,9788817001564),Paperback,,365 pages,"

","In Tokyo, sixteen-year-old Nao has decided there’s only one escape from her aching loneliness and her classmates’ bullying, but before she ends it all, Nao plans to document the life of her great-grandmother, a Buddhist nun who’s lived more than a century. A diary is Nao’s only solace—and will touch lives in a ways she can scarcely imagine.Across the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchbox—possibly debris from the devastating 2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the past, into Nao’s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future. Full of Ozeki’s signature humour and deeply engaged with the relationship between writer and reader, past and present, fact and fiction, quantum physics, history, and myth, A Tale for the Time Being  is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home.",0857867989,9780857867988),ebook,,429 pages,"

","A man named Mohammed sits in a café in Vienna, about to propose a deal to a Colombian. Mohammed has a strong network of agents and sympathizers throughout Europe and the Middle East, and the Colombian has an equally strong drug network throughout America. What if they were to form an alliance, to combine all their assets and connections? The potential for profits would be enormous—and the potential for destruction unimaginable.  In the Brave New World of terrorism—where anybody with a spare AK-47, a knowledge of kitchen chemistry, or simply the will to die can become a player—the old rules no longer apply. No matter what new governmental organizations come into being, the only truly effective ones are those that are quick and agile, free of oversight and restrictions...and outside the system.  Way outside the system.  In a nondescript office building in suburban Maryland, the firm Hendley Associates does a profitable business in stocks, bonds, and international currencies, but its true mission is quite different: to identify and locate terrorist threats, and then deal with them, in whatever manner necessary. Established with the knowledge of President John Patrick Ryan, ""the Campus"" is always on the lookout for promising new talent, its recruiters scattered throughout the armed forces and government agencies—and three men are about to cross its radar.  The first is Dominic Caruso, a rookie FBI agent, barely a year out of Quantico, whose decisive actions resolve a particularly brutal kidnap/murder case. The second is Caruso's brother, Brian, a Marine captain just back from his first combat action in Afghanistan, and already a man to watch. And the third is their cousin...a young man named Jack Ryan, Jr.  Jack was raised on intrigue. As his father moved through the ranks of the CIA and then into the White House, Jack received a life course in the world and the way it operates from agents, statesmen, analysts, Secret Service men, and black ops specialists such as John Clark and Ding Chavez. He wants to put it all to work now—but when he knocks on the front door of ""the Campus,"" he finds that nothing has prepared him for what he is about to encounter. For it is indeed a different world out there, and in here...and it is about to become far more dangerous. ",,,Kindle Edition,,496 pages,"

The only people I ever see are my mom and my nurse, Carla.But then one day, a moving truck arrives. New next door neighbors. I look out the window, and I see him. He’s tall, lean and wearing all black—black t-shirt, black jeans, black sneakers and a black knit cap that covers his hair completely. He catches me looking and stares at me. I stare right back. His name is Olly. I want to learn everything about him, and I do. I learn that he is funny and fierce. I learn that his eyes are Atlantic Ocean-blue and that his vice is stealing silverware. I learn that when I talk to him, my whole world opens up, and I feel myself starting to change—starting to want things. To want out of my bubble. To want everything, everything the world has to offer.Maybe we can’t predict the future, but we can predict some things. For example, I am certainly going to fall in love with Olly.

","Set in the same universe as The Parafaith War (but two centuries later, and intended to be read independently), The Ethos Factor is the story of Commander Van C. Albert of the Republic Space Force of Taran, a brave and resourceful officer who once defeated a larger enemy ship but indirectly caused the loss of a civilian liner in the process. Cleared by the board of inquiry, but an embarrassment to the high command, he retains his commission but is given only dead-end assignments. For a time, he must watch helplessly as cold war among economic, religious and political rivals evolves toward interstellar open warfare.Assigned as a military attaché at the Taran embassy on Scandya, Van is seriously wounded foiling an assassination. Decorated, promoted and summarily retired while still in a coma, he wakes to find himself honorably but intolerably unemployed. Then the harmless sounding Integrated Information Systems foundation of the Eco-Tech Coalition recruits him to fly a starship, Van finds he now has a powerful new vantage point not just for observation, but for action. The IIS has interests everywhere and Van is not just a pilot, but their point man in a conflict that will shake the worlds.Modesitt uses a distinctive blend of space battles, political and economic intrigue, and issues of race and religion to address deep questions of good and evil, ethics and self-interest. Van Albert makes his decisions; it is for you to decide if he is a hero.",0765347121,9780765347121),Mass Market Paperback,,537 pages,"

You're the proper single mum with a good head on your shoulders.

I notice your eyes when you look at me, too. And as crass as I appear when we're joking around about sex, my attraction to you is not a joke.So, what's the purpose of this note? I guess it's a reminder that we're adults, that sex is healthy and natural, and that you can find me just through the door past the kitchen. More specifically, it's to let you know that I'm leaving said door cracked open from now on in case you'd like to visit me in the middle of the night sometime.No questions asked.Think about it.Or don't.Whatever you choose.It's doubtful I'll even end up sliding this letter under your door anyway.--Simon",1682309800,9781682309803),ebook,,350 pages,"

","Lying on a cot in his cell with Alexandre Dumas's Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine open on his chest, Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter makes his debut in this legendary horror novel, which is even better than its sequel, The Silence of the Lambs. As in Silence, the pulse-pounding suspense plot involves a hypersensitive FBI sleuth who consults psycho psychiatrist Lecter for clues to catching a killer on the loose. The sleuth, Will Graham, actually quit the FBI after nearly getting killed by Lecter while nabbing him, but fear isn't what bugs him about crime busting. It's just too creepy to get inside a killer's twisted mind. But he comes back to stop a madman who's been butchering entire families. The FBI needs Graham's insight, and Graham needs Lecter's genius. But Lecter is a clever fiend, and he manipulates both Graham and the killer at large from his cell. That killer, Francis Dolarhyde, works in a film lab, where he picks his victims by studying their home movies. He's obsessed with William Blake's bizarre painting The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the Sun, believing there's a red dragon within him, the personification of his demonic drives. Flashbacks to Dolarhyde's terrifying childhood and superb stream-of-consciousness prose get us right there inside his head. When Dolarhyde does weird things, we understand why. We sympathize when the voice of the cruel dead grandma who raised and crazed him urges him to mayhem--she's way scarier than that old bat in Psycho. When he falls in love with a blind girl at the lab, we hope he doesn't give in to Grandma's violent advice. This book is awesomely detailed, ingeniously plotted, judiciously gory, and fantastically imagined. If you haven't read it, you've never had the creeps. --Tim Appelo",0099111519,9780099111511),Paperback,,421 pages,"

We try to stay out of each other’s way . . . that is until I have no other option but to ask for his help.  But what I don’t realize is he needs me just as much as I need him. I have money he’s desperate for, and he holds the key to making my dreams come true.  Our pranks turn from sarcastic banter, to sexual tension and lust-filled glances. Bickering matches quickly morph into slow burn moments. We’re hot, we’re cold. We push and pull. I need him, I don’t want him. We’re on the verge of combusting with an agreement dangling dangerously between us. Neither one of us can afford to lose one another and yet, we’re finding it quite hard to decipher the line that rests between love and hate.  *Twisted Twosome is a stand alone romantic comedy.",,,Kindle Edition,,333 pages,"

","Εκεί κάτω όλοι επιπλέουμε…Ένα αγοράκι με κίτρινο αδιάβροχο τρέχει χαρούμενο δίπλα σ’ ένα χάρτινο καραβάκι που αρμενίζει σ’ ένα πλημμυρισμένο από τη βροχή ρείθρο. Η βροχή έχει κοπάσει πια, και πέφτει στην κίτρινη κουκούλα σαν ψιλόβροχο σε τσίγκινη στέγη. Το αγόρι με το κίτρινο αδιάβροχο είναι ο Τζορτζ Ντένμπροου, κι εκείνη τη φθινοπωρινή ημέρα ήταν έξι χρονών…Αυτό που κάνει τη μικρή πόλη του Ντέρι τόσο τρομακτικά διαφορετική από τις άλλες είναι όλα εκείνα που βλέπουν –και αισθάνονται– μόνο τα παιδιά. Στα φρεάτια και τους υπονόμους, το ""Αυτό"" καραδοκεί και παίρνει τη μορφή εφιάλτη, του βαθύτερου τρόμου που φωλιάζει σε κάθε παιδί. Όμως, πότε πότε, το Αυτό προβάλλει από τα ζοφερά και υγρά βάθη, αρπάζει, διαμελίζει, σκοτώνει… Τα χρόνια περνούν, τα παιδιά μεγαλώνουν, εγκαταλείπουν την πόλη, λησμονούν. Μέχρι τη στιγμή που κάποιος τους καλεί να επιστρέψουν, για να αντιμετωπίσουν για μία ακόμα φορά το Αυτό, που σαλεύει σαν ερπετό στα σκοτεινά έγκατα της μνήμης τους καθώς αναδύεται για να μετατρέψει τους εφιάλτες του παρελθόντος σε μια ανείπωτα φρικτή πραγματικότητα.",,,Paperback,,752 pages,"

","A Barcellona, una mattina d'estate del 1945 il proprietario di un negozio di libri usati conduce il figlio undicenne, Daniel, al Cimitero dei Libri Dimenticati, un luogo segreto dove vengono sottratti all'oblio migliaia di volumi di cui il tempo ha cancellato il ricordo. E qui Daniel entra in possesso di un libro maledetto che cambierà il corso della sua vita, introducendolo in un mondo di misteri e intrighi legato alla figura di Julián Carax, l'autore di quel libro. Daniel ne rimane folgorato, mentre dal passato iniziano a emergere storie di passioni illecite, di amori impossibili, di amicizie e lealtà assolute, di follia omicida e di un macabro segreto custodito in una villa abbandonata. Una storia in cui Daniel ritrova a poco a poco inquietanti paralleli con la sua vita. Uscito in sordina in Spagna nel 2001, L'ombra del vento è divenuto un incredibile successo grazie al solo tam-tam dei lettori.

Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.     Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make.

They've traveled almost three thousand miles, pursued by old enemies and new dangers to meet the brilliant Dr. Maureen Cole, who promises she holds not only the key to saving Parole, but weathering the toxic storms of the deadly wasteland called the Tartarus Zone. On the way, they keep an eye out for everything and everyone they lost in the collapse - like Regan, who was last seen leaving Parole by himself, under very suspicious circumstances, and Zilch's precious organ jars, stolen by Eye in the Sky when Parole fell. There's no telling what or who they might find out here in this strange new world, or what lies deeper in its heart.But a lot of road lies between them and their goal.

En ese momento desesperado, encuentra refugio y trabajo en una vieja casa de piedra de Jerusalén, donde deberá hacer compañía y conversar con un anciano inválido y sarcástico. A su llegada, una atractiva mujer llamada Atalia advertirá a Shmuel de que no se enamore de ella; ese ha sido el motivo de la expulsión de sus predecesores. En la aparente rutina que se crea en la casa, el tímido Shmuel siente una progresiva agitación causada, en parte, por el deseo y la curiosidad que Atalia le provoca. También retoma su investigación sobre la imagen de Jesús para los judíos, y la misteriosa y maldita figura de Judas Iscariote, la supuesta encarnación de la traición y la mezquindad, va absorbiéndole sin remedio.",,,Kindle Edition,,304 pages,"

","Composed in the early thirteenth century, Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival is the re-creation and completion of the story left unfinished by its initiator Chretien de Troyes. It follows Parzival from his boyhood and career as a knight in the court of King Arthur to his ultimate achievement as King of the Temple of the Grail, which Wolfram describes as a life-giving Stone. As a knight serving the German nobility in the imperial Hohenstauffen period, the author was uniquely placed to describe the zest and colour of his hero's world, with dazzling depictions of courtly luxury, jousting and adventure. Yet this is not simply a tale of chivalry, but an epic quest for spiritual education, as Parzival must conquer his ignorance and pride and learn humility before he can finally win the Holy Grail.",9060380185,9789060380185),Paperback,,118 pages,"

","Discover a new understanding of Kierkegaard’s thought and his life, a story filled with romance, betrayal, humor, and riots.Kierkegaard, like Einstein and Freud, is one of those geniuses whose ideas permeate the culture and shape our world even when relatively few people have read their works. That lack of familiarity with the real Kierkegaard is about to changeThis lucid new biography by scholar Stephen Backhouse presents the genius as well as the acutely sensitive man behind the brilliant books. Scholarly and accessible, Kierkegaard: A Single Life introduces his many guises—the thinker, the lover, the recluse, the writer, the controversialist—in prose so compelling it reads like a novel.One chapter examines Kierkegaard’s influence on our greatest cultural icons—Kafka, Barth, Bonhoeffer, Camus, and Martin Luther King Jr., to name only a few. A useful appendix presents an overview of each of Kierkegaard’s works, for the scholar and lay reader alike.",0310520886,9780310520887),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

Desperate to be reunited with his mom, Perry goes on a quest for answers about her past crime. As he gets closer to the truth, he will discover that love makes people resilient no matter where they come from . . . but can he find a way to tell everyone what home truly means?",1504695984,9781504695985),Audio CD,,,"

","Starting in 1970, Jean Genet—petty thief, prostitute, modernist master—spent two years in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan. Always an outcast himself, Genet was drawn to this displaced people, an attraction that was to prove as complicated for him as it was enduring. Prisoner of Love, written some ten years later, when many of the men Genet had known had been killed, and he himself was dying, is a beautifully observed description of that time and those men as well as a reaffirmation of the author's commitment not only to the Palestinian revolution but to rebellion itself. For Genet's most overtly political book is also his most personal—the last step in the unrepentantly sacrilegious pilgrimage first recorded in The Thief's Journal, and a searching meditation, packed with visions, ruses, and contradictions, on such life-and-death issues as the politics of the image and the seductive and treacherous character of identity. Genet's final masterpiece is a lyrical and philosophical voyage to the bloody intersection of oppression, terror, and desire, at the heart of the contemporary world.",1590170288,9781590170281),Paperback,,430 pages,"

","A series of anecdotes, such as are included in Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman, shouldn't by rights add up to an autobiography, but that's just one of the many pieces of received wisdom that Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman (1918-88) cheerfully ignores in this engagingly eccentric book. Fiercely independent (read the chapter entitled ""Judging Books by Their Covers""), intolerant of stupidity even when it comes packaged as high intellectualism (check out ""Is Electricity Fire?""), unafraid to offend (see ""You Just Ask Them?""), Feynman informs by entertaining. It's possible to enjoy Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman, a bestseller ever since its initial publication in 1985, simply as a bunch of hilarious yarns with the author as know-it-all hero. At some point, however, attentive readers realise that underneath all the merriment simmers a running commentary on what constitutes authentic knowledge: learning by understanding, not by rote; refusal to give up on seemingly insoluble problems, and total disrespect for fancy ideas that have no grounding in the real world. Feynman himself had all these qualities in spades, and they come through with vigour and verve in his no-bull prose. No wonder his students--and readers around the world--adored him. --Wendy Smith",009917331X,9780099173311),Paperback,,350 pages,"

","Na een pijnlijke veroordeling wegens homoseksualiteit en zijn verblijf in een Engelse gevangenis leefde Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) de laatste vier maanden van zijn leven in Parijs. Dit boek nu bevat zijn memoires zoals hij die gedurende die periode zou kunnen hebben geschreven: zijn fictieve autobiografie dus. Hoewel zijn levensloop wel wordt gevolgd, gaat het hier niet om de historische juistheid, maar om het psychologisch portret dat uit het dagboek van Wilde spreekt. En dat portret is buitengewoon knap getekend: zowel de publieke persoonlijkheid van de dandy alsook de gevoelige en kunstzinnige estheet (die Wilde beide was) komen er in naar voren, verenigd op een wijze die een wel buitengewoon levendig beeld van Oscar Wilde schetst. Bovendien heeft de auteur een perfect gevoel voor het soort paradox en aforisme waar Wilde in grossierde. Een meesterwerk dat uitblinkt door diep psychologisch inzicht en warme sympathie voor een heel bijzonder mens. Voorbeeldig goede, soepele vertaling.",0349100594,9780349100593),Paperback,,185 pages,"

","Lenz, Georg Büchner’s visionary exploration of an 18th century playwright’s descent into madness, grew in part out of Alsatian pastor Johann Oberlin’s journal, which is translated here in its entirety for the first time. Lenz is a dispassionate account on the nervous system of a schizophrenic, perhaps the first third-person text ever written from the “inside” of insanity. At his death at the age of 23 in 1837, Georg Büchner also left behind Leonce and Lena, Woyzeck, and Danton’s Death—psychologically and politically acute plays well ahead of their time.Richard Sieburth’s translations include Hölderlin’s Hymns and Fragments, Walter Benjamin’s Moscow Diary, Gérard de Nerval’s Selected Writings and Henri Michaux’s Emergences/Resurgences.

","For a quarter of a million years, an alien race has been hiding a vast and terrible secretIn the 25th century, only the Shoal possess the secret of faster-than-light travel (FTL), giving them absolute control over all trade and exploration throughout the galaxy. Mankind has operated within their influence for two centuries, establishing a dozen human colony worlds scattered along Shoal trade routes. Dakota Merrick, while serving as a military pilot, has witnessed atrocities for which this alien race is responsible. Now piloting a civilian cargo ship, she is currently ferrying an exploration team to a star system containing a derelict starship. From its wreckage, her passengers hope to salvage a functioning FTL drive of mysteriously non-Shoal origin. But the Shoal are not yet ready to relinquish their monopoly over a technology they acquired through ancient genocide.",0330445960,9780330445962),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Com Crime e Castigo, a Editorial Presença inaugura a publicação da obra de um dos maiores escritores de sempre, numa nova e criteriosa tradução, feita directamente a partir do russo. Datado de 1866, este é o primeiro dos grandes romances que Dostoiévski escreveu já em plena maturidade literária, sendo, provavelmente, a mais bem conhecida de todas as suas obras. Recriando um estranho e doloroso mundo em torno da figura do estudante Raskólnikov, perturbado pelas privações e duras condições de vida, é uma das obras por excelência fundadoras da modernidade. Pelo inexcedível alcance e profundidade psicológica, sobretudo no que implica a exploração das motivações não conscientes e a aparente irracionalidade nos comportamentos das personagens, este autor russo tornou-se uma referência universal na literatura, sem perda de continuidade até aos nossos dias. Esta nova versão em língua portuguesa das obras de Dostoiévski, cuja qualidade permite ao leitor fruir plenamente da extraordinária riqueza dos textos originais, e da responsabilidade de Nina e Filipe Guerra.",8496142590,8496142590,Hardcover,"Colecção: Mil Folhas, #55",576 pages,"

Sarah is a narcoleptic who has dreams so vivid she mistakes them for real events. Robert has his life changed forever by the misunderstandings that arise from her condition. Terry spends his wakeful nights fueling his obsession with movies. And an increasingly unstable doctor, Gregory, sees sleep as a life-shortening disease which he must eradicate.But after ten years of fretful slumber and dreams gone bad, the four reunite in their college town to confront their disorders. In a Gothic cliffside manor being used as a clinic for sleep disorders, they discover that neither love, nor lunacy, nor obsession ever rests.",0140274421,9780140274424),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","Legendarily reticent, perverse and misleading, Prince is one of the few remaining 80s superstars who still, perhaps, remains unexplained. Now a firm fixture in the pop canon, where such classics as ""Purple Rain"", ""Sign o' the Times"" and ""Parade"" regularly feature in Best Ever Album polls, Prince is still, as he ever was, an enigma. His live performances are legendary (21 Nights at the O2 in 2007) and while recent releases have been modestly successful at best, his influence on urban music, and R'n'B in particular, has never been more evident. The Minneapolis Sound can now be heard everywhere. Matt Thorne's ""Prince"", through years of research and interviews with ex-Revolution members such as Wendy and Lisa, is an account of a pop maverick whose experiments with rock, funk, techno and jazz revolutionized pop. With reference to every song, released and unreleased, over 35 years of recording, Prince will stand for years to come as the go-to book on the Great Man.",0571273491,9780571273492),Hardcover,,672 pages,"

","Wu Hsin repeatedly returns to three key points. First, on the phenomenal plane, when one ceases to resist What-Is and becomes more in harmony with It, one attains a state of Ming, or clear seeing. Having arrived at this point, all action becomes wei wu wei, or action without action (non-forcing) and there is a working in harmony with What-Is to accomplish what is required.Second, as the clear seeing deepens (what he refers to as the opening of the great gate), the understanding arises that there is no one doing anything and that there is only the One doing everything through the many and diverse objective phenomena which serve as Its instruments.From this flows the third and last: the seemingly separate me is a misapprehension, created by the mind which divides everything into pseudo-subject (me) and object (the world outside of this me). This seeming two-ness (dva in Sanskrit, duo in Latin, dual in English), this feeling of being separate and apart, is the root cause of unhappiness.",,,Kindle Edition,,,"

","Louise é mãe solteira, trabalha como secretária e está presa à rotina da vida moderna: ir para o escritório, cuidar da casa, do filho e tentar descansar no tempo livre. Em uma rara saída à noite, ela conhece um homem no bar e se deixa envolver. Embora ele se vá logo depois de um beijo, Louise fica muito animada por ter encontrado alguém.Ela só não esperava que seu novo e casadíssimo chefe seria o homem do bar. Apesar de ele fazer questão de logo esclarecer que o beijo foi um equívoco, em pouco tempo os dois passam a ter um caso. Em uma terrível sequência de erros, Louise acaba ficando amiga da esposa do amante. E, se você acha que sabe para onde esta história vai, pense de novo, porque Por trás de seus olhos não se parece com nenhum livro que já tenha passado por suas mãos. À medida que é arrastada para a história do casal, Louise acaba com mais perguntas que respostas e a única coisa certa é que algo naquele casamento está muito, muito errado.Em Por trás de seus olhos, best-seller do Sunday Times e do The New York Times, Sarah Pinborough não só reinventa o tradicional triângulo amoroso, como o vira do avesso e de ponta-cabeça, numa trama “com tantos jogos mentais que você vai começar a se perguntar se esse triângulo tem mesmo três lados”, como destaca Josh Malerman, autor de Caixa de pássaros.",,,Kindle Edition,,336 pages,"

","Blurb Have you ever wondered if we choose our loved ones during our lifetime? Before or after that time? Do you ponder the meaning of your existence? Your destiny? What life would be like if your enemies or rivals didn’t exist at all? Brian Sunderland, whom some might call a “profound researcher,” has been looking for answers to these questions. In fact, his entire life so far has been ruled by this quest, as he journeys through various dilemmas, such as surrendering to true love, his coming of age, fighting, standing up for his rights, helping others, and finally, leaving his mark on this world. In stark contrast, Peter Drake is portrayed quite realistically, as he and a cast of “everyday heroes and heroines,"" including General Grant and Lianne Starling, deal with some extraordinary circumstances, tough times, action-packed scenes, and high drama. Sympathetic characters as well as despicable ones float in and out, yet ultimately, the main intrigue of the story concerns the complex relationships and dynamic interactions that occur between the good guys and the bad. Does each person deserve what he or she gets? Does each person move on with life – or simply fail? Read on to find out.About the Author For the time being, Benedict J. Stuart resides in Europe with his girlfriend, taking care of two pets. They are still considered to be relatively young and intelligent. His dreams are mainly about better education, including lifelong learning, raising cultural awareness and improvement of overall human communication worldwide with the help of modern technology. Finally, he is a firm believer in broad general knowledge per se.",1717533027,9781717533029),Paperback,First,306 pages,"

","For time out of mind, bloodthirsty demons have stalked the night, culling the human race to scattered remnants dependent on half-forgotten magics to protect them. Then two heroes arose—men as close as brothers, yet divided by bitter betrayal. Arlen Bales became known as the Warded Man, tattooed head to toe with powerful magic symbols that enable him to fight demons in hand-to-hand combat—and emerge victorious. Jardir, armed with magically warded weapons, called himself the Deliverer, a figure prophesied to unite humanity and lead them to triumph in Sharak Ka—the final war against demonkind. But in their efforts to bring the war to the demons, Arlen and Jardir have set something in motion that may prove the end of everything they hold dear—a Swarm. Now the war is at hand and humanity cannot hope to win it unless Arlen and Jardir, with the help of Arlen’s wife, Renna, can bend a captured demon prince to their will and force the devious creature to lead them to the Core, where the Mother of Demons breeds an inexhaustible army.Trusting their closest confidantes, Leesha, Inevera, Ragen and Elissa, to rally the fractious people of the Free Cities and lead them against the Swarm, Arlen, Renna, and Jardir set out on a desperate quest into the darkest depths of evil—from which none of them expects to return alive.",0345531507,9780345531506),Hardcover,,781 pages,"

","A deep study of the uneasy heart by one of the masters of the psychological novel, Journey into the Past, published here for the first time in America, is a novella that was found among Zweig’s papers after his death. Investigating the strange ways in which love, in spite of everything - time, war, betrayal - can last, Zweig tells the story of Ludwig, an ambitious young man from a modest background who falls in love with the wife of his rich employer. His love is returned, and the couple vow to live together, but then Ludwig is dispatched on business to Mexico, and while he is there the First World War breaks out. With travel and even communication across the Atlantic now shut down, Ludwig makes a new life in the New World. Years later, however, he returns to Germany to find his beloved a widow and their mutual attraction as strong as ever. But is it possible for love to survive precisely as the impossible?",1590173678,9781590173671),Paperback,,136 pages,"
