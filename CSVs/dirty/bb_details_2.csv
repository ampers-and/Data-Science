Read on your PC, Mac, smart phone, tablet or Kindle device.  Fat begets fat- it's an idea that has been ingrained in our heads by doctors and dietitians alike in the wake of the recent obesity epidemic. But what if that idea, that eating fat makes you fat, is wrong? Author Mark Hyman, M.D. Challenges this long-held belief in his new guide, Eat Fat, Get Thin. Hyman explores the idea that eating more fat does not necessarily make you fatter; in fact, he maintains that adding more fats to your diet can reverse disease, diabetes and even help lose weight.  This revolutionary book is your complete guide to living and eating healthy. Eat Fat, Get Thin is split into four parts and immediately sets to work tearing down the long-held perception that ingesting lots of fat is bad for your health. Hyman provides a number of resources for the reader as well, including shopping lists, exercise plans, and plenty of input regarding just how these fats work to improve your health. It's a compelling guide jam-packed with scientific evidence supporting the idea that eating more fats can actually improve your health.  For the reader looking to make a change, Eat Fat, Get Thin is an excellent piece. Mark Hyman does an excellent job of providing resources to support the reader and encourage the change, rather than just offer dry advice. From start to finish, the book is thorough in its offering of unconventional wisdom and ways to make your personal transformation happen. Practical and well-written, Eat Fat, Get Thin is a thought-provoking diet plan that is sure to turn your perception of healthy eating and wellness on its head.

","Antes que John Glenn descrevesse uma órbita à volta da terra ou Neil Armstrong caminhasse na lua, um grupo de matemáticas, conhecidas como os ""computadores humanos"", calculava, com lápis, réguas e calculadoras simples, equações complicadas que permitiriam lançar os foguetões e os astronautas para o espaço.Entre estas ""calculadoras"" havia um pequeno grupo excecional de mulheres afro-americanas, especialmente talentosas. Faziam parte das mentes mais brilhantes da sua geração. Mulheres que tinham sido relegadas para ensinar matemática em escolas públicas só para negros do Sul, mas que foram chamadas para servir durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial, devido à escassez de mão de obra, quando a indústria da aviação necessitava de qualquer pessoa que pudesse ajudar. De repente, essas mulheres desvalorizadas até então, encontraram empregos adequados à sua genialidade, e responderam afirmativamente à chamada do Tio Sam e foram para Hampton, na Virgínia, para o fascinante laboratório aeronáutico de Langley.Mesmo ali, foram segregadas do resto das mulheres porque a Lei na Virgínia assim o estabelecia. Deste modo, esta equipa ajudou de forma excelente a que os Estados Unidos ganhassem a corrida espacial à URSS durante a Guerra Fria.Esta é a história verdadeira das mulheres matemáticas afro-americanas da NASA, cujos cálculos ajudaram a concretizar alguns dos maiores feitos americanos no espaço, na qual se baseia um dos grandes filmes de Hollywood",8491391061,9788491391067),Paperback,,347 pages,"

","When Andrew Wiles of Princeton University announced a solution of Fermat's last theorem in 1993, it electrified the world of mathematics. After a flaw was discovered in the proof, Wiles had to work for another year--he had already labored in solitude for seven years--to establish that he had solved the 350-year-old problem. Simon Singh's book is a lively, comprehensible explanation of Wiles's work and of the star-, trauma-, and wacko-studded history of Fermat's last theorem. Fermat's Enigma contains some problems that offer a taste of the math, but it also includes limericks to give a feeling for the goofy side of mathematicians.",9780007453061,9780007453061,Paperback,,340 pages,"

Now, Divakaruni returns with her most gripping novel yet.Orphaned at birth, seventeen-year-old Korobi Roy is the scion of a distinguished Kolkata family and has enjoyed a privileged, sheltered childhood with her adoring grandparents. But she is troubled by the silence that surrounds her parents’ death and clings fiercely to her only inheritance from them: the love note she found hidden in her mother's book of poetry. Korobi dreams of one day finding a love as powerful as her parents', and it seems her wish has come true when she meets the charming Rajat, the only son of a high-profile business family.But shortly after their engagement, a heart attack kills Korobi's grandfather, revealing serious financial problems and a devastating secret about Korobi's past. Shattered by this discovery and by her grandparents' betrayal, Korobi undertakes a courageous search across post 9/11 America to find her true identity. Her dramatic, often startling journey will, ultimately, thrust her into the most difficult decision of her life.",1451695659,9781451695656),Hardcover,,289 pages,"

","En la España del siglo de Oro, codicia, corrupción, estafa y asesinato han invadido un reino gobernado por tres viudos y un fraile. Entre tanto hombre sin amor, apenas queda sitio para un hombre honrado Otoño de 1615. Un doble enlace por poderes está a punto de unir las coronas de Francia y España en una alianza que pretende ser el germen de la paz en Europa: el de la española Ana de Austria con Luis XIII, rey de Francia, y el de la francesa Isabel de Borbón con el príncipe Felipe. Tras los festejos, ambas damas, seguidas por sus respectivas cortes, emprenderán su camino hasta el paso de Behovia, en la frontera sobre el río Bidasoa, donde se producirá lo que ya se conoce popularmente como «El intercambio de las princesas». Pero Isidoro Montemayor, secretario y amante de la condesa de Cameros, no participa del júbilo general. Un asunto de contrabando de plata pone en peligro a su adorada Micaela y, en consecuencia, también a él. Isidoro, héroe a su pesar, amante contrariado y tenaz investigador, se ve de repente obligado a cambiar la pluma por la espada e intentar conservar la vida en una España donde abundan las puñaladas a traición, tanto en los callejones lóbregos como en las resplandecientes alcobas reales. Con maestría, rigor y una velada ironía, Alfonso Mateo-Sagasta recrea ante nuestros ojos una España marcada por la corrupción y nos brinda esta apasionante aventura de caballeros despechados, damas enamoradas, aunque no bobas, y metales preciosos que unos y otros desean sobre todas las cosas. La crítica ha dicho... «El buen hacer de Isidoro Montemayor, su vis cómica, sus amoríos, su valor y su heroica villanía nos conducen por el lado ameno de la narración, trufada de multitud de anécdotas y de un humor elegante.» Juan Bolea, El Periódico de Aragón «Amor, aventuras y política en una historia trepidante. Una novela como las de antes; un narrador excepcional.» Víctor Andresco, crítico literario y escritor «Un excelente narrador.» Luís Fernández, El Mundo «Mateo-Sagasta, maestro en el género.» Isabel Margarit, Historia y Vida ENGLISH DESCRIPTION With mastery, rigor, and veiled irony, Alfonso Mateo-Sagasta recreates a Spain marked by corruption, and offers us a thrilling adventure of disgruntled knights, lovestruck—but not stupid—women, and precious metals that some desire above all else. Fall, 1615. A double wedding is about to unite the French and Spanish crowns in an alliance that is expected to sow the seed of peace in Europe: that of Anne of Austria with Luis XIII, King of France, and that of Elisabeth of France with Prince Philip. After the festivities, both ladies, followed by their respective courts, set out on the journey to the Behobia Pass, on the border along the Bidasoa River, where what is popularly known as “The Exchange of Princesses” takes place.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,528 pages,"

","(1) أن يذهب باحث إلى أن النبي عليه السلام كان رسولاً وملكاً، وليس بدعاً ولا شذوذاً أن يخالف في ذلك مخالف، فذلك بحث خارج عن دائرة العقائد الدينية التي تعارف العلماء بحثها، واستقر لهم فيها مذهب.(2) أنت تعلم أن الرسالة غير الملك، وأنه ليس بينهما شيء من التلازم بوجه من الوجوه، وأن الرسالة مقام والملك مقام آخر، فكم من ملك ليس نبياً ولا رسولاً، وكم لله جل شأنه من رسل لم يكونوا ملوكاً. بل أن أكثر من عرفنا من الرسل إنما كانوا رسلاً فحسب.ولقد كان عيسى بن مريم عليه السلام رسول الدعوة المسيحية، وزعيم المسيحيين، وكان مع هذا يدعو إلى الإذعان لقيصر، ويؤمن بسلطانه. وهو الذي أرسل بين أتباعه تلك الكلمة البالغة ""أعطوا ما لقيصر لقيصر، ولله لله"".وكان يوسف بن يعقوب عليه السلام، عاملاً من العمال، في دولة فرعون مصر.ولا نعرف في تاريخ الرسل من جمع الله له بين الرسالة والملك، إلا قليلاً.فهل كان محمد صلى الله تعالى عليه وسلم ممن جمع الله له بين الرسالة والملك، أم كان رسولاً غير ملك؟(3) لا نعرف لأحد من العلماء رأياً صريحاً في ذلك البحث ولا نجد من تعرض للكلام فيه، بحسب ما أتيح لنا. ولكنا قد نستطيع بطريق الاستنتاج أن نقول: أن المسلم العامي يجنح غالباً إلى اعتقاد أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان ملكاً رسولاً، وأنه أسس بالإسلام دولة سياسية مدنية، كان هو ملكها وسيدها. لعل ذلك هو الرأي الذي يتلاءم مع ذوق المسلمين العام، ومع ما يتبادر من أحوالهم في الجملة، ولعله أيضاً هو رأي جمهور العلماء من المسلمين، فانك تراهم، إذا عرض لهم الكلام في شيء يتصل بذلك الموضوع، يميلون إلى اعتبار الإسلام وحدة سياسية، ودولة أسسها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم.وكلام ابن خلدون في مقدمته ينحو ذلك المنحى، فقد جعل الخلافة التي هي نيابة عن صاحب الشرع في حفظ الدين وسياسة الدنيا، شاملة للملك والملك مندرجاً تحتها الخ.لخص رفاعة بك الكلام في الوظائف والعمالات البلدية، خصوصية وعمومية، أهلية داخلية وجهادية، التي هي عبارة عن نظام السلطنة الإسلامية وما يتعلق بها من الحرف والصنائع، والعمالات الشرعية، على ما كان في عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وجمع في ذلك بين الكلام على خدمه الخاصة به صلى الله عليه وسلم، وما يضاف إلى الإمامة العظمى من الأعمال الأولية، كالوزارة والحجابة وولاية البُدْن والسقاية والكتابة وما يضاف إلى العمالات الفقهية من معلم القرآن ومعلم الكتابة ومعلم الفقه، والمفتي وإمام الصلاة والمؤذن...، ثم ذكر التراجمة وكتابة الجيش والعطاء والديوان الزمام، وبيّن أن للديوان أصلاً في عهد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، ثم ذكر العمالات المتعلقة بالأحكام، كالإمارة العامة على النواحي، والقضاء وما يتعلق به من إشهاد الشهود وكتابة الشروط والعقود والمواريث والنفقات، والقسام وناظر البناء للتحديد، وذكر المحتسب والمنادي، ومتولي حراسة المدينة، والجاسوس لأهل المدينة، والسجان ومقيمي الحدود.(4) لاشك في أن الحكومة النبوية كان فيها بعض ما يشبه أن يكون من مظاهر الحكومة السياسية وآثار السلطنة والملك.(5) وأول ما يخطر بالبال مثالاً من أمثلة الشؤون الملكية، التي ظهرت أيام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، مسألة الجهاد، فقد غزا صلى الله عليه وسلم المخالفين لدينه من قومه العرب، وفتح بلادهم، وغنم أموالهم، وسبي رجالهم ونساءهم، ولاشك في أنه صلى الله عليه وسلم قد امتد بصره إلى ما وراء جزيرة العرب، واستعد للانسياب بجيشه في أقطار الأرض، وبدأ فعلاً يصارع دولة الرومان في الغرب، ويدعو إلى الانقياد لدينه كسرى الفرس في الشرق، ونجاشي الحبشة ومقوقس مصر الخ.وظاهر أول وهلة أن الجهاد لا يكون لمجرد الدعوة إلى الدين، ولا لحمل الناس على الإيمان بالله ورسوله، وإنما يكون الجهاد لتثبيت السلطان، وتوسيع الملك.دعوة الدين دعوة إلى الله تعالى، قوام تلك الدعوة لا يكون إلا البيان، وتحريك القلوب بوسائل التأثير والإقناع فأما القوة والإكراه فلا يناسبان دعوة يكون الغرض منها هداية القلوب، وتطهير العقائد، وما عرفنا في تاريخ الرسل رجلاً حمل الناس على الإيمان بالله بحد السيف، ولا غزا قوماً في سبيل الإقناع بدينه، وذلك هو نفس المبدأ الذي يقرره النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فيما كان يبلغ من كتاب الله.""فإن حاجُّوك فقل أسلمتُ وجْهيَ لله ومن أتبعن، وقل للذين أُوتُوا الكتابَ والأميّين أأسلمتم؟ فأن أَسْلموا فقد اهتَدَوا، وإن تولَّوا فإنما عليك البلاغُ، واللهُ بصير بالعباد"".تلك مبادئ صريحة في أن رسالة النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، كرسالة إخوانه من قبل، إنما تعتمد على الإقناع والوعظ، وما كان لها أن تعتمد على القوة والبطش، وإذا كان صلى الله عليه وسلم قد لجأ إلى القوة والرهبة، فذلك لا يكون في سبيل الدعوة إلى الدين وإبلاغ رسالته إلى العالمين، وما يكون لنا أن نفهم إلا أنه كان في سبيل الملك، ولتكوين الحكومة الإسلامية. ولا تقوم حكومة إلا على السيف، وبحكم القهر والغلبة، فذلك عندهم هو سر الجهاد النبوي ومعناه.(6) قلنا أن الجهاد كان آية من آيات الدولة الإسلامية، ومثالاً من أمثلة الشئون الملكية، وإليك مثلا آخر،:كان في زمن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عمل كبير متعلق بالشئون المالية، من حيث الإيرادات والمصروفات، ومن حيث جمع المال من جهاته العديدة، ""الزكاة والجزية والغنائم الخ"" ومن حيث توزيع ذلك كله بين مصارفه، وكان له صلى الله عليه وسلم سعاة وجباة، يتولون ذلك له، ولاشك أن تدبير المال عمل ملكي، بل هو أهم مقومات الحكومات، على أنه خارج عن وظيفة الرسالة من حيث هي، وبعيد عن عمل الرسل باعتبارهم رسلاً فحسب.(7) وقد يكون من أقوى الأمثلة في هذا الباب ما روى الطبري بإسناده، أن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وجه أمارة اليمن وفرقها بين رجاله، وأفرد كل رجل بحيِّزه واستعمل عمرو بن حزم على نجران، وخالد بن سعيد بن العاص على ما بين نجران ورِمَع وزبيد، وعامر بن شهر على همدان، وعلى صنعاء ابن باذام، وعلى عك والاشعرين الطاهر بن أبي هالة، وعلى مأرب أبا موسى الأشعري، وعلى الجَنَد يَعْلَى بن أبي أمية، وكان معاذ معلما يتنقل في عمالة كل عامل باليمن وحضرموت الخ.هنالك كثير غير ما ذكرنا قد وجد في العصر النبوي، مما يمكن اعتباره أثراً من آثار الدولة، ومظهراً من مظاهر الحكومة، ومخايل السلطنة، فمن نظر إلى ذلك من هذه الجهة، ساغ له القول بأن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان رسول الله تعالى، وكان ملكاً سياسياً أيضاً.(8) إذا ترجح عند بعض الناظرين اعتبار تلك الأمثلة، واطمأن إلى الحكم بأنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان رسولاً وملكاً، فسوف يعترضه حينئذ بحث آخر جدير بالتفكير. فهل كان تأسيسه صلى الله عليه وسلم للمملكة الإسلامية، تصرفه في ذلك الجانب شيئا خارجاً عن حدود رسالته صلى الله عليه وسلم، أم كان جزءاً مما بعثه الله له وأوحى به إليه؟فأما أن المملكة النبوية عمل منفصل عن دعوة الإسلام، وخارج عن حدود الرسالة، فذلك رأي لا نَعرِف في مذاهب المسلمين ما يشاكله، ولا نذكر في كلامهم ما يدل عليه، وهو على ذلك رأي صالح لأن يذهب إليه، ولا نرى القول به يكون كفراً ولا الحاداً، وربما كان مجمولاً على هذا المذهب ما يراه بعض الفرق الإسلامية من إنكار الخلافة في الإسلام مرة واحدة.ولا يهو لك أن تسمع أن للنبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عملاً كهذا خارجاً عن وظيفة الرسالة، وأن ملكه الذي شيده هو من قبيل ذلك العمل الدنيوي الذي لا علاقة له بالرسالة، فذلك قول إن أنكرته الأذن، لأن التشدق به غير مألوف في لغة المسلمين، فقواعد الإسلام، ومعنى الرسالة، وروح التشريع، وتاريخ النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، كل ذلك لا يصادم رأياً كهذا ولا يستفظعه. بل ربما وجد ما يصلح له دعامة وسنداً، ولكنه على كل حال رأي نراه بعيداً.(9) وأما أن المملكة النبوية جزء من عمل الرسالة متمم لها، وداخل فيها، فذلك هو الرأي الذي تلقاه نفوس المسلمين فيما يظهر بالرضا، وهو الذي تشير إليه أساليبهم، وتُؤيده مبادئهم ومذاهبهم، ومن البيّن أن ذلك الرأي لا يمكن تعقله إلا إذا ثبت أن من عمل الرسالة أن يقوم الرسول، بعد تبليغ الدعوة الإلهية بتنفيذها على وجه عملي، أي أن الرسول يكون مبلغاً ومنفذاً معا.(10) غير أن الذين بحثوا في معنى الرسالة، ووقفا على مباحثهم، أغفلوا دائماً أن يعتبروا التنفيذ جزءاً من حقيقة الرسالة، إلا ابن خلدون، فقد جاء في كلامه ما يشير إلى أن الإسلام دون غيره من الملل الأخرى قد اختص بأنه جمع بين الدعوة الدينية وتنفيذها بالفعل، وذلك المعنى ظاهر في عدة مواضع من مقدمته التاريخية، وقد بينه بنوع من البيان في الفصل الذي شرح فيه اسم البابا والبطرك في الملة النصرانية، واسم الكوهن عند اليهود، فقال:""إعلم أن الملة لابد لها من قائم عند غيبة النبي، يحملهم على أحكامها وشرائعها، ويكون كالخليفة فيهم للنبي فيما جاء به من التكاليف. والنوع الإنساني أيضاً، بما تقدم من ضرورة السياسة فيهم للاجتماع البشري، لابد لهم من شخص يحملهم على مصالحهم، ويَزَعُهم عن مفاسدهم، بالقهر، وهو المسمى بالملك، والملة الإسلامية لما كان الجهاد فيها مشروعاً، لعموم الدعوة، وحمل الكافة على دين الإسلام طوعاً أو كرهاً، اتحدت فيها الخلافة والملك، لتوجه الشوكة من القائمين بها إليها معا، وأما ما سوى الملة الإسلامية فلم تكن دعوتهم عامة، ولا الجهاد عندهم مشروعا، إلا في المدافعة فقط، فصار القائم بأمر الدين فيها لا يعنيه شيء من سياسة الملك، لأنهم غير مكلفين بالتغلب على الأُمم الأُخرى، وإنما هم مطلوبون بإقامة دينهم في خاصة أنفسهم الخ"".فهو كما ترى يقول، أن الإسلام شرع تبليغي وتطبيقي، وأن السلطة الدينية اجتمعت فيه والسلطة السياسية، دون سائر الأديان.(11) لا نرى لذلك القول دعامة، ولا نجد له سنداً، وهو على ذلك ينافى معنى الرسالة، ولا يتلاءم مع ما تقضي به طبيعة الدعوة الدينية كما عرفت، وليكن ذلك القول صحيحاً، فقد بقي مشكل آخر عليهم أن يجدوا له جواباً.إذا كان رسول صلى الله عليه وسلم قد أسس دولة سياسية، أو شرع في تأسيسها، فلماذا خلت دولته أذن من كثير من أركان الدولة ودعائم الحكم؟ ولماذا لم يعرف نظامه في تعيين القضاة والولاة؟ ولماذا لم يتحدث إلى رعيته في نظام الملك وفي قواعد الشورى؟ ولماذا ترك العلماء في حيرة واضطراب من أمر النظام الحكومي في زمنه؟ ولماذا ولماذا! نريد أن نعرف منشأ ذلك الذي يبدو للناظر كأنه إبهام أو اضطراب أو نقص، أو ما شئت فسمه، في بناء الحكومة أيام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وكيف كان ذلك؟ وما سره؟لعل أولئك الذين يصرون على اعتقادهم أن محمداً صلى الله عليه وسلم قام بدعوة إلى دين جديد، وإلى تأسيس دولة جديدة، ويصرون على أن الدولة التي أنشأها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كانت توضع أسسها، وتدار شؤونها، وتنظم أمورها، بوحي الله تعالى أحكم الحاكمين، ثم يضطرهم ذلك إلى اعتقاد أن نظام الدولة زمن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، بلغ غاية الكمال التي تعجز عنها عقول البشر، وتريد دونها أفكارهم، لعل أولئك إذا سئلوا عن سر هذا الذي يبدو نقصاً في أنظمة الحكم، وإبهاماً في قواعده، قد يلتمسون للجواب إحدى تلك الخطط التي سنأخذ الآن في بيانها.(12) أما صاحب كتاب تخريج الدلائل السمعية ـ ويوافقه رفاعة بك ـ فقد وجد له من ذلك المأزق مخلصاً سهلاً، فزعم أن الحكومة كانت تشتمل في زمن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم على كل ما يلزم للدولة من عمال وأعمال، وأنظمة مضبوطة، وقواعد محدودة، وسنن مفصلة تفصيلاً، لا مجال بعده لجديد، ولا زيادة لمستزيد.(13) قد يقول قائل يريد أن يؤيد ذلك المذهب بنوع من التأييد، على طريقة أخرى: أنه لا شيء يمنعنا من أن نعتقد أن نظام الدولة زمن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم كان متيناً ومحكماً، وكان مشتملاً على جميع أوجه الكمال، التي تلزم لدولة يدبرها رسول من الله، يؤيده الوحي، وتؤازره ملائكة الله، غير أننا لم نصل إلى علم التفاصيل الحقيقية، ودقائق ما كانت عليه الحكومة النبوية، من نظام بالغ، وإحكام سابغ، لأن الرواة قد تركوا نقل ذلك إلينا، أو أنهم نقلوه، ولكن غاب علمه عنا، أو لسبب آخر، ""وما أُوتيتم من العلم إلا قليلاً"".(14) تلك خطة لا ينبغي أن يرفضها لأول وهلة عقل العلماء. فإنه لا حرج على نفوسنا أن يخالطها الشك في أننا نجهل كثيراً من شؤون التاريخ النبوي، بل الواقع أننا نجهل منه ومن غيرها أكثر مما نعرف.على أهل العلم أن يؤمنوا دائماً بأن كثيراً من الحقائق محجوب عنهم، وعليهم أن يدأبوا أبداً في كشف مغيبها، واستنباط الجديد منها، ففي ذلك حياة العلم ونماؤه، غير أن احتمال جهلنا ببعض الحقائق لا ينبغي أن يمنعنا من الوثوق بما علمنا منها، واعتبارها حقائق علمية، نبني عليها الأحكام، ونقيم المذاهب، ونبين لها الأسباب، ونستخلص منها النتائج، حتى يظهر لنا ما يخالفها.فنسأل من جديد عن منشأ ذلك الذي عرفنا إلى الآن من الإبهام والاضطراب في نظام الحكومة النبوية، وعن سره ومعناه.(15) هنالك خطة أخرى للجواب عن ذلك السؤالذلك أن كثيراً مما نسميه اليوم أركان الحكومة، وأنظمة الدولة، وأساس الحكم،، إنما هي اصطلاحات عارضة، وأوضاع مصنوعة، وليست هي في الواقع ضرورية لنظام دولة تريد أن تكون دولة البساطة، وحكومة الفطرة، التي ترفض كل تكلف، وكل ما لا حاجة بالفطرة البسيطة إليه.وكل ما يمكن ملاحظته على الدولة النبوية يرجع عند التأمل إلى معنى واحد، ذلك هو خلوها من تلك المظاهر التي صارت اليوم عند علماء السياسة من أركان الحكومة المدنية، وهي في حقيقة الأمر غير واجبة، ولا يكون الإخلال بها حتما نقصاً في الحكم، ولا مظهراً من مظاهر الفوضى والاختلال، فذلك تأويل ما يلاحظ على الدولة النبوية مما قد يعد اضطراباً.(16) كان محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم يحب البساطة، ويكره التكلف، وعلى البساطة الخالصة التي لا شائبة فيها قامت حياته الخاصة والعامة، كان يدعو إلى البساطة في القول والعمل، كما في حديثه مع جرير بن عبد الله البجلي ""يا جرير إذا قلت فأوجز، وإذا بلغت حاجتك فلا تتكلف"".كان يعاشر الناس من غير تكلف، ويجري معهم على منهج البساطة، وقد ""روي أنه صلى الله عليه وسلم كان يمازح أصحابه... وعن ابن عباس رضي الله عنهما: كانت في النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم دعابة"" وكان يقول لأصحابه ""إني أكره أن أتميز عليكم، فأن الله يكره من عبده أن يراه متميزاً بين أصحابه"" وروي أنه صلى الله عليه وسلم ""ما خُيّر بين أمرين إلا اختار أيسرهما ما لم يكن إثْماً"".كان صلى الله عليه وسلم يكره الرياء والتكلف، ويقول في حجة الوداع ""اللهم اجعله حجاً مبروراً، لا رياء فيه ولا سمعة"" وقال الله تعالى مخاطباً له عليه السلام ""قُل ما أسألكم عليه من أجْرٍٍ وما أنا من المتكلفين"" وكان فيما يبلغ عن شريعة الله تعالى يأمر الناس بالقواعد البسيطة، وينهاهم عن التكلف، ويناديهم ""إذا أمرتكم بأمر فأتوا منه ما استطعتم"" ""وأن هذا الدين متين فأوغل فيه برفق"" ""وما جَعل عليكم في الدين من حَرج"".ولا تجد فيما جاء به من الشرائع حكماً يرجع إلا إلى المبادئ الأمية الساذجة. فلم يكلفهم في أوقات الصلاة أن يحسبوا درج الشمس، ولا مطالع النجوم، بل جعل مناط ذلك ما يحس به كل إنسان من حركة الشمس المشاهدة في السماء، وجعل الصوم والحج ومناسك العبادة متصلة بحركة القمر، وحركة القمر محسوسة لا تحتاج إلى حساب ولا رصد، ولم يكلفنا في الصوم أن نحسب لهلال رمضان، بل جعل ذلك منوطاً برؤية الهلال رؤية بسيطة لا تكلف فيها، وجاء في ذلك الحديث ""نحن أمة أمية الخ"" وحديث صوموا لرؤيته الخ، ولم يكلفنا حساب اليوم بالساعات والدقائق، بل ربطه كذلك بالشيء المحسوس، الذي لا خفاء فيه ""وَكُلوا واشْربُوا حتى يَتَبيّنَ لكمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبيضُ من الخيْطِ الأسودِ من الفجر ثم أَتمُّوا الصّيامَ إلى الليْلِ"".كان صلى الله عليه وسلم أمياً ورسولاً إلى الأميين، فما كان يخرج في شيء من حياته الخاصة والعامة ولا في شريعته عن أصول الأمية، ولا عن مقتضيات السذاجة والفطرة السليمة التي فطر الله الناس عليها، فلعل ذلك الذي رأينا في نظام الحكم أيام النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم هو النظام الذي تقضي به البساطة الفطرية. ولا ريب في أن كثيراً من نظم الحكم في الوقت الحاضر إنما هي أوضاع وتكلفات، وزخارف طال بنا عهدنا فألفناها، حتى تخيلناها من أركان الحكم وأصول النظام، وهي إذا تأملت ليست من ذلك في شيء.إن هذا الذي يبدو لنا إبهاماً أو اضطراباً أو نقصاً في نظام الحكومة النبوية لم يكن إلا البساطة بعينها، والفطرة التي لا عيب فيها.(17) لو كنا نريد أن نختار لنا طريقاً من بين تلك الطرق التي قصصنا عليك، لكان ذلك الرأي أدنى إلى اختيارنا، فإنه بالدين أشبه. لكنا لا نستطيع أن نتخذه لنا رأياً، لأنك إن تأملت وجدته غير وجيه ولا صحيح.حق أن كثيراً من أنظمة الحكومات الحديثة أوضاع وتكلفات، وأن فيها ما لا يدعو إليه طبع سليم، ولا ترضاه فطرة صحيحة، ولكن من الأكيد الذي لا يقبل شكاً أيضاً أن في كثير مما استحدث في أنظمة الحكم ما ليس متكلفاً ولا مصنوعاً، ولا هو مما ينافي الذوق الفطري البسيط، وهو مع ذلك ضروري ونافع، ولا ينبغي لحكومة ذات مدنية وعمران أن تهمل الأخذ به.وهل من سلامة الفطرة وبساطة الطبع مثلاً أن لا يكون لدولة من الدول ميزانية تقيد إيرادها ومصروفاتها، أو أن لا يكون لها دواوين تضبط مختلف شؤونها الداخلية والخارجية، إلى غير ذلك ـ وأنه لكثير ـ مما لم يوجد منه شيء في أيام النبوة، ولا أشار إليه النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم.إنه ليكون تعسفاً غير مقبول أن يعلل ذلك الذي يبدو من نقص المظاهر الحكومية زمن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم بأن منشأة سلامة الفطرة، ومجانبة التكلف.فنلتمس وجهاً آخر لحل ذلك الإشكال.---------------------------المصدر : الإسلام وأصول الحكم",Arabic,Arabic,Paperback,,178 pages,"

","كان على الطلبة في الجامعة الامريكية في بيروت، أن يحضروا دورتين دراسيتين في العلوم الانسانية، تعنيان بتطور الفكر الانساني، وتشملان موضوعات تتنوع بين فلسلفة و أدب وفن ، كان الهدف منها هو أن يكون لدى الطالب، مهما كان مجال دراسته ، بعض الإلمام بشؤون الانسان العامة و الجوهرية، معارف تغتني بها روحه و تتسع بها آفاقه. وكان من بين الكتب التي قررت علينا للدراسة ، آنذاك، كتاب عن ""ملحمة جلجامش"" وهي القصيدة السومرية الشهيرة التي يعدها البعض أقدم النصوص الأدبية المكتشفة، أو من أقدمها.وصلتنا الملحمة بروايات متعددة، باللغة السومرية ، تم جمعها لاحقا في عمل أدبي واحد، بلغة أهل بابل ، المسماة الأكدية ، في حوالي عام ١٨٠٠ قبل الميلاد. إلا أن اكثر النسخ تماسكا ، هي تلك التي يعود تاريخها الى مابين عامي ١٣٠٠ و ١٠٠٠ قبل الميلاد، والتي كتبت بالخط المسماري ، على اثني عشرة لوحة فخارية، وجدت أجزاء منها ، صدفة، في نينوى بالعراق في القرن التاسع عشر ، في أطلال مكتبة الملك آشور بانيبال ، ىخر الملوك الآشوريين"".جلجامش، بطل هذه الملحمة ، يختلف عن أبطال الملاحم الأغريقية. فبينما كان أولئك شخوصا خياليين من ابداع هوميروس ، كان لبطل ملحمتنا وجود حقيقي في التاريخ. إذ تشير سجلات السلالات الحاكمة لممالك مابين النهرين ، إلى أن جلجامش حكم أوروك حوالي عام ٢٧٠٠ قبل الميلاد. و بعد وفاته، ولحقب طويلة، ذاع صيته كفارس مغوار، ومحارب شرس، و كمشيد للاعمال الهندسية الشامخة. أما أوروك فقد كانت من أشهر مدن ما بين النهرين، وقد عثر على بعض آثارها بالقرب من بلدة الوركاء، جنوب العراق، بين البصرة وبغداد. ومما زاد من صيت هذه الملحمة و الاهتمام بها، في العرب المسيحي تحديدا ، ترجمة اللوح الحادي عشر إلى الانجليزية في عام ١٨٧٢م. إذ تضمن هذا اللوح قصة مشابهة في كثير من تفاصيلها لقصة الطوفان الذي حدث في زمن نوح ، عليه السلام، المذكورة في سفر التكوين ، من أسفار العهد القديم، والتي ورد ذكرها في القرآن الكريم أيضا ._ عبدالله جمعة.",9786039047811,9786039047811,Paperback,1st Edition,131 pages,"

","Karin Slaughter’s novels featuring detective Will Trent are utterly riveting and masterfully drawn. Her latest thriller, Unseen, pits detectives, lovers, and enemies against one another in an unforgettable standoff between righteous courage and deepest evil. Will Trent is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent whose latest case has him posing as Bill Black, a scary ex-con who rides a motorcycle around Macon, Georgia, and trails an air of violence wherever he goes. The cover has worked and he has caught the eye of a wiry little drug dealer who thinks he might be a useful ally. But undercover and cut off from the support of the woman he loves, Sara Linton, Will finds his demons catching up with him. Although she has no idea where Will has gone, or why, Sara herself has come to Macon because of a cop shooting: Her stepson, Jared, has been gunned down in his own home. Sara holds Lena, Jared’s wife, responsible: Lena, a detective, has been a magnet for trouble all her life, and Jared’s shooting is not the first time someone Sara loved got caught in the crossfire. Furious, Sara finds herself involved in the same case that Will is working without even knowing it, and soon danger is swirling around both of them. In a novel of fierce intensity, shifting allegiances, and shocking twists, two investigations collide with a conspiracy straddling both sides of the law. Karin Slaughter’s latest is both an electrifying thriller and a piercing study of human nature: what happens when good people face the unseen evils in their lives.",0345539478,9780345539472),Hardcover,,379 pages,"

Grey
CHRISTIAN GREY exercises control in all things; his world is neat, disciplined, and utterly empty – until the day that Anastasia Steele falls into his office, in a tangle of shapely limbs and tumbling brown hair. He tries to forget her, but instead is swept up in a storm of emotion he cannot comprehend and cannot resist. Unlike any woman he has known before, shy, unworldly Ana seems to see right through him – past the business prodigy and the penthouse lifestyle to Christian’s cold, wounded heart.Will being with Ana dispel the horrors of his childhood that haunt Christian every night? Or will his dark sexual desires, his compulsion to control, and the self-loathing that fills his soul drive this girl away and destroy the fragile hope she offers him?
Darker

Determined to win her back, he tries to suppress his darkest desires and his need for complete control, and to love Ana on her own terms.But the horrors of his childhood still haunt him, and Ana’s scheming boss, Jack Hyde, clearly wants her for himself. Can Christian’s confidant and therapist, Dr. Flynn, help him face down his demons? Or will the possessiveness of Elena, his seducer, and the deranged devotion of Leila, his former submissive, drag Christian down into the past?And if Christian does win Ana back, can a man so dark and damaged ever hope to keep her?",English,English,ebook,,,"

","From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Wrath and the Dawn, comes a sweeping, action-packed YA adventure set against the backdrop of Feudal Japan where Mulan meets Throne of Glass.The daughter of a prominent samurai, Mariko has long known her place--she may be an accomplished alchemist, whose cunning rivals that of her brother Kenshin, but because she is not a boy, her future has always been out of her hands. At just seventeen years old, Mariko is promised to Minamoto Raiden, the son of the emperor's favorite consort--a political marriage that will elevate her family's standing. But en route to the imperial city of Inako, Mariko narrowly escapes a bloody ambush by a dangerous gang of bandits known as the Black Clan, who she learns has been hired to kill her before she reaches the palace. Dressed as a peasant boy, Mariko sets out to infiltrate the Black Clan and track down those responsible for the target on her back. Once she's within their ranks, though, Mariko finds for the first time she's appreciated for her intellect and abilities. She even finds herself falling in love--a love that will force her to question everything she's ever known about her family, her purpose, and her deepest desires.",0147513871,9780147513878),Paperback,,392 pages,"

","“In another life, she was my forever.” An unexpected tragedy leaves Professor Nathaniel Hunt a widower alone with a newborn baby. He hires a nanny. She’s young, but well-qualified, with a simple life, a crazy name obsession, and a boyfriend she met at the grocery store. Over time, he discovers she knows things about him—things that happened before she was born—like a hidden scar on his head, his favorite pizza, and how he cheated on a high school Spanish test. She speaks familiar words and shares haunting memories that take him back to over two decades earlier when he lost his best friend in a tragic accident. “I’m afraid of what’s going to happen when you realize I’m not her.”Transcend is a sexy, mind-bending journey that uncovers possibilities, challenges beliefs, and begets the age-old question: is there life after death?Subscribe",Transcend,#1,,,318 pages,"

He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he’d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization.And then he meets a girl.First as his captive, then his reluctant house guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R’s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn’t want to eat this girl—although she looks delicious—he wants to protect her.

","Jeff Malmquist is unaccountably catapulted to the year 2060. He finds himself in New Gary, Indiana, a labor camp of one million Chicagoans, their identities hacked and incriminated as pedophiles through the collusion of a corrupt US Government, the Russian cybermafia, and China. He escapes to Chicago, only to find himself in a full-scale replica of Ancient Rome in China, erected for the wealthy country’s amusement and manned by a million enslaved Italians. As he struggles to orient himself in these synchronized urban labyrinths, he is plunged back to real Ancient Rome, before being flung yet further into the future: It’s 2115 and the Chinese Empire rules the world. The former Western hemisphere is now the American Special Administrative Region, a vast Cantonese-speaking slave colony. Malmquist will soon be shipped to the most opulent city the world has ever known for an unspeakable fate. A dystopian satire both bleak and funny, The Kitchens of Canton distills the worst of our present and future societies into a strangely seductive maze of a story.",English,English,Paperback,,244 pages,"

","The Aeneid is an epic poem written by Virgil in the 1st century BC. It's hero is Aeneas, a Trojan who travels from Troy to Italy to eventually found Rome. Some argue that The Aeneid is Virgil's answer to Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, combining two genres of the day - travel and war - into one poem. Take that, Homer!No civilization is without a bit of revisionist history: so it was that Virgil picked up the story of Aeneas, which was already floating around at the time, and forged an epic founding myth for Rome. And The Aeneid fit the bill, as it linked Rome with the legends of ancient Troy, glorified stodgy Roman values, and legitimized its emperors as descendants of the heroes and gods of the past. George Washington probably didn't chop down a cherry tree, but it's a fun legend to tell the kids.",8804342854,9788804342854),Paperback,,774 pages,"

I've never read anything like it. You've created great value and I adore your pithy quote-ables all over the place. You've created the weirdest, coolest new genre of fiction and I love it."" - It’s June, 1980 and piano prodigy, Juniper Cole is on the way to her senior prom. - It’s January 2010, and Koda Mulvaney has blown through his 20 million dollar trust fund and is told by his father to return home and get to work. - It’s August, 1904 and little Onyx Webb is on her way to the famous World’s Fair in St. Louis with her father, Catfish. Two of the three will see a ghost, one will become a ghost and everyone will learn that life is hard to let go of even when you’re dead. And that's just Episode One. A paranormal suspense, supernatural romance, with a dash of historical fiction, Onyx Webb is what author Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz have called creep-spiration.

","From the catalog: At long last, the epic biography Ted Williams deserves – and that his fans have been waiting for. Ted Williams was the best hitter in baseball history. This Red Sox legend's batting average of .406 in 1941 has not been topped since, and no player who has hit over 500 home runs has a higher career batting average. Those totals would have been even higher if Williams had not left baseball for nearly five years in the prime of his career to serve as a Marine pilot in World War II and Korea. He hit home runs as far as or farther than any player before him – and traveled a long way himself, as Ben Bradlee, Jr.'s, grand biography reveals. Born in 1918 in San Diego, Ted would spend most of his life disguising his Mexican heritage. During his 22 years with the Boston Red Sox, Williams electrified crowds across American–and shocked them, too: His notorious clashes with the press and fans threatened his reputation. Yet while he was a God in the batter's box, he was profoundly human once he stepped away from the plate. His ferocity came to define his troubled domestic life. While baseball might have been straightforward for Ted Williams, life was not. ""The Kid"" is biography of the highest literary order, a thrilling and honest account of a legend in all his glory and human complexity. In his final at-bat, Williams hit a home run. Bradlee's marvelous book clears the fences, too.",0316614351,9780316614351),Hardcover,,855 pages,"

","Coraline lives with her preoccupied parents in part of a huge old house--a house so huge that other people live in it, too... round, old former actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and their aging Highland terriers (""We trod the boards, luvvy"") and the mustachioed old man under the roof (""'The reason you cannot see the mouse circus,' said the man upstairs, 'is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed.'"") Coraline contents herself for weeks with exploring the vast garden and grounds. But with a little rain she becomes bored--so bored that she begins to count everything blue (153), the windows (21), and the doors (14). And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now, if you're thinking fondly of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe or Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you're on the wrong track. Neil Gaiman's Coraline is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious.  What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her name correctly (not ""Caroline""), delicious meals (not like her father's overblown ""recipes""), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of live rats. The creepiest part, however, is her mirrored parents, her ""other mother"" and her ""other father""--people who look just like her own parents, but with big, shiny, black button eyes, paper-white skin... and a keen desire to keep her on their side of the door. To make creepy creepier, Coraline has been illustrated masterfully in scritchy, terrifying ink drawings by British mixed-media artist and Sandman cover illustrator Dave McKean. This delightful, funny, haunting, scary as heck, fairy-tale novel is about as fine as they come. Highly recommended.

","With a sick mother, the bills piling up and her best friend leaving town in the middle of it all, the last thing Cynthia Giles needs in her life is a man. Especially one like Seth McBride. Sure, he's sexy as hell and the memory of what his strong hands felt like on her body keep her up at night, but that's exactly why she needs to keep her distance. It was one time...okay twice...but it can't happen again because Seth represents everything she doesn't need. She isn't his type. Not even close. Seth likes his women blond, wild and without any expectations for a relationship. But there's something about the smoldering redhead that Seth can't stay away from. Neither of them meant for anything to happen between them, but it did and ever since, Seth can't get her out of his head. And he's almost positive Cynthia feels the connection, too. He might even be able to convince her to admit she feels the same way. But when Cynthia discovers a truth that will rock both of their worlds, all bets are off while they try to navigate their new future.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,159 pages,"

But before he expired, Dreadnought passed his mantle to her, and those secondhand superpowers transformed Danny’s body into what she’s always thought it should be. Now there’s no hiding that she’s a girl. It should be the happiest time of her life, but Danny’s first weeks finally living in a body that fits her are more difficult and complicated than she could have imagined. Between her father’s dangerous obsession with “curing” her girlhood, her best friend suddenly acting like he’s entitled to date her, and her fellow superheroes arguing over her place in their ranks, Danny feels like she’s in over her head.She doesn’t have much time to adjust. Dreadnought’s murderer—a cyborg named Utopia—still haunts the streets of New Port City, threatening destruction.

","The literary theories of American expatriate Gertrude Stein (1874–1946) strongly influenced a generation of young American writers (notably Hemingway), and her ideas about writing still provoke and stimulate.Although much of her own work embodies innovative experimentation with language and sound, the present volume is fairly conventional in style and quite accessible. Regarded by some critics as a minor masterpiece, Three Lives was Stein's first published book. In it she tells the stories of three working class women — Anna, a conscientious but rigid serving woman; Melanctha, a worldly-wise and sensitive black girl; and Lena, a gentle but feeble-minded maid.Although these are relatively ordinary women, in Stein's hands their lives and minds take on extraordinary interest. Told in clear, carefully crafted prose, these stories are not only memorable works in themselves but an excellent entree to Stein's later work.",English,English,Paperback,,176 pages,"

","'The magnitude and vital importance of the Battle of Britain has found a superb chronicler in Stephen Bungay' Andrew RobertsStephen Bungay's magisterial history is the definitive book about this central event in Britain's history and mythology. Unrivalled for its synthesis of all previous historical accounts, for the acuity and intelligence of its strategic analysis and its sheer narrative drive, it is a book ultimately distinguished by the trenchancy of its conclusions -- that it was the British in the Battle who displayed all the virtues of efficiency, organisation and even ruthlessness we habitually attribute to the Germans, and they who fell short in their amateurism, ill-preparedness, engineering sub-standards and even in their old-fashioned notions of gallantry.An addictive read and gripping throughout, this book is a classic of military history.Stephen Bungay is Director of the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre in London. He is the author of Alamein (Aurum) and Making Strategy Happen (Nicholas Brealey 2009.) Since the first publication of The Most Dangerous Enemy in 2000, the author has become a respected authority in television documentaries, and lectures on the Battle to the RAF itself.",B0071B705O,B0071B705O,Kindle Edition,,513 pages,"

They were underdogs, but now there is no limit to what they will do to get money and respect in their territory. Robbery, torture, and murder help smart people comply with their demands. Undoubtedly, they eventually meet their match.The posse decides to rob and kill Jose, who appears to be an easy target for them to cheat.

","Christianity taught her faithful into putting all their trust in the miracles of God through his Divine Providence, more than in the miracles of the Law of Nature through our Perfect Obedience. There is only one law governing the life in the world: God’s LAW OF NATURE. The Law of Nature is the Law of Life. They who obey the Law shall be rewarded with peace, harmony, and prosperity. Inversely, they who disobey the Law shall be punished with endless conflict, disunity, and poverty—regardless of their faith in God. For faith in God without regard for the good dictates of Nature is at all a faith in no God. Obeying the Law of Nature is obeying God, for indeed the Law of Nature is God.Having faith in God ought not to be trusting that God will always provide even against all odds, but rather trusting that for as long as we remain faithful to the good dictates of Nature, God shall never fail to provide. Amen.",English,English,ebook,,30 pages,"

","When Hailey Harper left her family farm to enroll in veterinary school, she had a plan: keep her head down, ace her classes, and most importantly… don’t upset the uncle paying her tuition. Translation? Don’t piss off his dramatic, self-absorbed daughter, Danica, even if she’s a nightmare to live with.Falling in love with her cousin’s rock star ex-boyfriend was definitely not part of the plan. As the drummer of a now-famous rock band, Mike Madden could have any girl he wants. He’s sweet, funny, romantic, talented—and the only guy that’s ever made Hailey’s heart do cartwheels in her chest. The more she gets to know him, the harder she falls, but Hailey knows they can never be more than friends… because Danica wants him back, and she’ll fight dirty to win.Mike is falling for Hailey too, but Danica’s threats and his rock star life—music video shoots, international tours, obsessed fans—could tear them apart before they’ve even begun. Hailey isn’t sure she’s the one for him, but Mike’s waited years for a girl like her… and he’ll do anything to prove it.",B01J16RJGQ,B01J16RJGQ,Kindle Edition,,496 pages,"

","«Sono davvero contento di aver chiarito le cose. In ogni caso resteremo sempre buoni amici, giusto?» Quando un ragazzo dice così a una ragazza non è che la renda pazzamente felice. Se poi il ragazzo in questione è Gideon de Villiers, occhi verdi e capelli corvini, Gwendolyn Shepherd, la destinataria del messaggio, si sente precipitare decisamente negli abissi dell’infelicità. E sì, perché, nelle due settimane che le hanno sconvolto la vita, facendole quasi dimenticare di essere una normale studentessa di sedici anni di una normale scuola londinese, Gideon le era sembrato la sua unica ancora di salvezza. Solo da due settimane, infatti, Gwen ha scoperto di essere predestinata a viaggiare nel tempo per portare a termine una missione pericolosissima da cui dipende il destino dell’umanità intera.Una faccenda che, in realtà, non le interessa affatto, diversamente dalla cugina Charlotte, che era convinta di essere lei la predestinata e che era stata educata ad affrontare situazioni e persone di ogni tempo e ogni luogo. Solo per Gideon, il suo compagno di viaggi nel passato, Gwen ha trovato sopportabile l’essere sballottata da un secolo all’altro alla ricerca di un cronografo perduto, ma ora perché dovrebbe continuare a lasciarsi tiranneggiare dall’implacabile setta dei Guardiani? D’altra parte, è vero che a poco a poco sta scoprendo segreti insospettabili sulla propria famiglia che la riguardano molto da vicino. E poi, finché è sostenuta da amiche come Leslie e da piccoli gargoyle impiccioni e simpatici come Xemerius, la sua vita, oltre a essere piena di pericoli, può essere anche molto eccitante...",886380284X,9788863802849),Hardcover,,423 pages,"

","“In a single year, my father left us twice. The first time, to end his marriage, and the second, when he took his own life. I was ten years old.”Master storyteller Madeleine Thien takes us inside an extended family in China, showing us the lives of two successive generations—those who lived through Mao’s Cultural Revolution and their children, who became the students protesting in Tiananmen Square. At the center of this epic story are two young women, Marie and Ai-Ming. Through their relationship Marie strives to piece together the tale of her fractured family in present-day Vancouver, seeking answers in the fragile layers of their collective story. Her quest will unveil how Kai, her enigmatic father, a talented pianist, and Ai-Ming’s father, the shy and brilliant composer, Sparrow, along with the violin prodigy Zhuli were forced to reimagine their artistic and private selves during China’s political campaigns and how their fates reverberate through the years with lasting consequences.With maturity and sophistication, humor and beauty, Thien has crafted a novel that is at once intimate and grandly political, rooted in the details of life inside China yet transcendent in its universality.",039360988X,9780393609882),Hardcover,,480 pages,"

She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined.Filled with characters both fascinating and fantastical, The Rook is a richly inventive, suspenseful, and often wry thriller that marks an ambitious debut from a promising young writer.",1908800984,9781908800985),Paperback,,482 pages,"

Através do olhar curioso e rebelde de uma criança, Harper Lee descreve-nos o dia-a-dia de uma comunidade conservadora onde o preconceito e o racismo caracterizam as relações humanas, revelando-nos, ao mesmo tempo, o processo de crescimento, aprendizagem e descoberta do mundo típicos da infância.

De facto, disse que tudo começara naquele verão em que o Dill apareceu por estas bandas, da primeira vez que ele sugeriu que tentássemos obrigar o Boo Radley a sair de casa. Aí eu disse-lhe que, se quiséssemos ter uma visão mais alargada da questão, então teríamos de recuar até à época do presidente Andrew Jackson. Se o general Jackson não tivesse decidido expulsar a tribo Creek dos seus territórios rio acima, o Simon Finch jamais teria vindo parar ao Alabama. E então, onde é que nós estaríamos neste momento?

","La torre elevada narra la increíble historia de varios hombres cuyos destinos se entrecruzan y confluyen de forma dramática el 11 de septiembre de 2001. Con una precisión poco común, sustentada en más de quinientas entrevistas realizadas a lo largo de cinco años, nos describe el auge del fundamentalismo islámico, la creación de al-Qaeda y los errores cometidos por los confiados servicios de inteligencia que culminaron en el atentado de las Torres Gemelas. Lawrence Wright recrea de modo excepcional la transformación de Osama bin Laden y Ayman al-Zawahiri de combatientes idealistas e incompetentes en Afganistán a líderes del grupo terrorista más importante de la historia; y sigue de cerca a John O'Neill, jefe de la sección de contraterrorismo del FBI y uno de los pocos agentes estadounidenses que comprendió, ya en los años noventa, la magnitud de la amenaza que representaba dicha organización. Lleno de información, con una profunda perspectiva histórica, este es el mejor libro escrito sobre los orígenes de al-Qaeda y el atentado que cambió el curso de la historia.Esta edición incluye un epílogo del autor con motivo del décimo aniversario de los atentados del 11-S, la evolución de al-Qaeda y la muerte de Bin Laden.«El libro del año.» JOHN LE CARRÉ«Literatura como verdad.» ANTONIO MUÑOZ MOLINA«Ganó el Premio Pulitzer.

She follows them on their annual return to the remote Azorean islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where bulls run down village streets, volcanoes are active, and the people celebrate festas to ease their saudade, a longing so deep that the Portuguese word for it can’t be fully translated.Years later, California is in a terrible drought, the wildfires seem to never end, and Diana finds herself still dreaming of those islands and the chuva—a rain so soft you don’t notice when it begins or ends.With her troublesome Labrador retriever, Murphy, in tow, Diana returns to the islands of her dreams only to discover that there are still things she longs for—and one of them may be a most unexpected love.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,252 pages,"

","Op 13 april 1927 voer Allene Tew met de Mauretania de haven van New York uit. Ze liet een leven achter zich waarin ze alles had bereikt waar ze als plattelandsmeisje van had gedroomd – aanzien, fortuin, moederschap, haar grote liefde. En ze was het ook bijna allemaal weer kwijtgeraakt. ‘De rijkste en verdrietigste weduwe van de stad’, zoals Allene door societyrubrieken werd genoemd, had die dag echter ook nog veel vóór zich, zoals een nieuw gezin en een toekomst als officiële prinses, als Russische gravin en als peetmoeder van de latere koningin Beatrix.De Amerikaanse prinses is een reconstructie van een weids en fascinerend leven, dat zich afspeelt tegen het decor van Amerika en Europa, de victoriaanse en de moderne tijd, de industriële en Russische revolutie en de twee wereldoorlogen. Maar het is bovenal het persoonlijke verhaal van een uitzonderlijke vrouw die de moed had om, tot het bittere eind, haar eigen, onnavolgbare weg te gaan.",B016DROIS8,B016DROIS8,Kindle Edition,,242 pages,"

Relaţia dintre ei se transformă pe nesimţite într-una de înţelegere reciprocă şi empatie. Când menajera îi mărturiseşte că are un fiu de zece ani care o aşteaptă singur acasă, Profesorul îi cere să-l aducă în fiecare zi, după şcoală. Treptat, Profesorul îi iniţiază în jocurile matematice, reprezentând pentru el adevărurile supreme pe care se sprijină lumea, iar acest mod inedit şi emoţionant de comunicare reuşeşte să creeze o legătură puternică între cei trei.

This volume presents the distinguished translation by R. J. Hollingdale, with a new introduction that argues for a dramatic change in Nietzsche's views from Human, All too Human to Daybreak, and shows how this change, in turn, presages the main themes of Nietzsche's later and better-known works such as On the Genealogy of Morality.

After much soul searching (if a persocom could even be considered to have a soul) Chi comes to the realization that her feelings towards Hideki, her ""someone just fer her,"" are nothing short of love. Only two obstacles stand between her and happiness. First there's Hideki; he's been struggling with the idea that a person can have feelings for a machine. Can her return her love? Second is the mysterious Zima and Dita.

Ashleigh’s latest craze is Julie’s own passion, Pride and Prejudice. But Ashleigh can’t just appreciate it as a great read; she insists on emulating the novel’s heroines, in speech, dress, and the most important element of all—finding True Love. And so Julie finds herself with Ashleigh, dressed in vintage frocks, sneaking into a dance at the local all-boys prep school, where they discover some likely candidates. The problem with Ashleigh’s craze this time, however, is that there is only one Mr. Darcy. So when the girls get a part in the boys’ school musical, what follows is naturally equal parts comedy and romance, as a series of misinterpreted—and missed—signals, dating mishaps, and awkward incidents make Julie wonder if she has the heart for True Love.",0399243895,9780399243899),Hardcover,,212 pages,"

","Jacalyn Duffin's History of Medicine provides a brief survey of the history of Western medicine with reference to recent scholarly literature and current issues in health care. Organized conceptually around the major fields of medical endeavour - anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, surgery, obstetrics, psychiatry, pediatrics, and family medicine - this book is an accessible overview of medical history as a vibrant component of social, intellectual, and cultural history, and as a research discipline in its own right.Each chapter begins in antiquity and ends in the twentieth century. Throughout, Duffin shows that alternative interpretations can be found for most elements of our past and that topics of interest can go well beyond 'great men' and 'great discoveries' to include ideas, diseases, patients, institutions, and great mistakes. This approach does not mean that the 'great men' (and women) are neglected; rather they appear in context. Medical disasters such as chloramphenicol and thalidomide, are covered along with the triumphs, and examples from Canada's past, largely ignored in other medical histories, are included. A chapter on methodology, suggestions for further reading with special attention to Canadian sources, and a careful index make it possible to research a specific event or historical debate, or to satisfy a more general curiosity.By presenting the material in a structure that resonates with the broad outlines of medical training, and by focusing on the questions asked most often, this text is a relevant guide for students to the history of the profession they are about to embrace, and for those who would teach them, be they physicians or historians. Duffin's clear and entertaining prose and the many illustrations will help to demystify medicine for general readers and for students in other domains, such as history, philosophy, and sociology.",0802079121,9780802079121),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","The Barnes & Noble ReviewAcclaimed author Doreen Rappaport and Coretta Scott King Award winner Bryan Collier, who previously collaborated on 
Freedom River
, have pooled their talents yet again in a stunning tribute to civil rights activist Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. An extraordinary picture-book biography, Martin's Big Words consists of Rappaport's own words interwoven with quotes from Dr. King...all powerfully brought to life by Collier's striking, glorious art. Rappaport's spare, gripping text and Collier's distinctive collage-and-watercolor illustrations depict King's life journey with reverence and dignity -- beginning with his childhood experience of seeing ""White Only"" signs throughout his hometown, presenting his efforts as a civil rights crusader, and ending abruptly with his assassination. The front cover of the book immediately conveys King's power and spiritual strength, consisting entirely of a lifelike portrait of him -- the title and the author's and illustrator's names are relegated to the back cover. As Collier says in his illustrator's note, he ""tried to push [the imagery] to an emotional level that allows the reader to bring his or her own experience to it, without actually losing the intensity or the intention of the story."" His technique is utterly effective. By using simple, direct language -- much of it King's -- the text offers young readers an accessible yet profound introduction to King's legacy. It explains that as a child, he listened to his minister father's ""big words"" and vowed to inspire others with such words when he grew up. The book's final sentence: ""His big words are alive for us today,"" testifies to King's success -- and to the timeless importance of this great leader's ideals. As further inspiration for interested readers, Martin's Big Words includes a list of significant dates as well as a bibliography of resources for them to explore.

","Frank Windham is a Mormon cowboy -- hard-working, trying to be honest, convinced he is going to hell for incurable lust, and convinced that he deserves to. He has an ultra-pious mother, a brother who is more than just a little touched in the head, and a comfortable Lutheran girlfriend who knows she has been saved. This is a story about sin and salvation, written with raunchiness and reverence. It is an extraordinary landmark in Mormon fiction -- the first novel to consider the ubiquitous tension between religious guilt and sexual frustration.Set against the backdrop of southern Utah's canyon country, the protagonist manifests exuberance and innocence that is constrained only by strict moral education. The sometimes humorous, sometimes tragic posturing required of Frank in concealing his humanity behind a mask of forced righteousness makes for comic, painful, and moving scenarios.For instance, he punishes himself for lapses of self-denial by fasting and tying his hands to the bedpost. He comes to see dating as an evil indulgence in sensual fantasy and his work on the ranch as a tool of avarice. His attempt to exorcise this hypocrisy and the confusion about how to atone for it result in an epiphany that restores equilibrium to the world.",1560850159,9781560850151),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","The times, they are a-changin' . . .The Orange County, California, that the Becker brothers knew as boys is no more -- unrecognizably altered since the afternoon in 1954 when Nick, Clay, David, and Andy rumbled with the lowlife Vonns, while five-year-old Janelle Vonn watched from the sidelines. The new decade has brought about the end of the orange groves and the birth of suburban sprawl. It is the era of Johnson, hippies, John Birchers, and LSD. Clay becomes a casualty of a far-off jungle war. Nick becomes a cop, Andy a reporter, David a minister. And the decapitated corpse of teenage beauty queen Janelle Vonn is discovered in an abandoned warehouse.A hideous crime has touched the Beckers in ways that none of them could have anticipated, setting three brothers on a dangerous collision course that will change their family -- and their world -- forever.And no one will emerge from the wreckage unscathed.--back cover",0060562374,9780060562373),Mass Market Paperback,US / CAN Edition,396 pages,"

Although General Bottando of the Italian National Art Theft Squad has little confidence in Jonathan's theories, Bottando's lovely assistant, Flavia di Stefano, is intrigued by the idea of a lost classic, and by Jonathan himself. But in the midst of the painting's discovery and the resultant worldwide publicity, a new chain of events is set into action. First vandalism, then murder, surround the painting. And as new facts about its true nature emerge, Bottando sends Flavia and Jonathan to investigate--little knowing that the pair will be on the run for the truth... and for their very lives.",0425166139,9780425166130),Mass Market Paperback,,226 pages,"

What if his position as an international journalist was really a cover for Cold War cat-and-mouse games?In Death to Spies, Ian Fleming, master operative, steps out from the shadow of his creation to take his rightful place in the pantheon of fictional spies.Fleming’s idyll on the island of Jamaica is disrupted when a ranking member of British Intelligence shows up with a wild story of purloined nuclear secrets and moles within British Intelligence, then mysteriously disappears, apparently the victim of foul play. Investigating, Fleming faces hostility in Los Alamos--where anyone not American is automatically suspect--meets a glamorous, sexy woman with few scruples, and narrowly survives several attempts on his life.

","In this lyrical, hallucinatory novel set in Morocco, Tahar Ben Jelloun offers an imaginative and radical critique of contemporary Arab social customs and Islamic law. The Sand Child tells the story of a Moroccan father's effort to thwart the consequences of Islam's inheritance laws regarding female offspring. Already the father of seven daughters, Hajji Ahmed determines that his eighth child will be a male. Accordingly, the infant, a girl, is named Mohammed Ahmed and raised as a young man with all the privileges granted exclusively to men in traditional Arab-Islamic societies. As she matures, however, Ahmed's desire to have children marks the beginning of her sexual evolution, and as a woman named Zahra, Ahmed begins to explore her true sexual identity. Drawing on the rich Arabic oral tradition, Ben Jelloun relates the extraordinary events of Ahmed's life through a professional storyteller and the listeners who have gathered in a Marrakesh market square in the 1950s to hear his tale. A poetic vision of power, colonialism, and gender in North Africa, The Sand Child has been justifiably celebrated around the world as a daring and significant work of international fiction.",0801864402,9780801864407),Paperback,,176 pages,"

","The late antique world possessed no voice like that of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (AD 121-180). His meditations on what constitutes a good life have withstood the centuries and reach us today with a force that has not diminished. In this remarkable new translation, philosopher Jacob Needleman and classics scholar John P. Piazza reveal Marcus Aurelius not only in light of his philosophical ideas, but as a great practitioner who struggled to live according to those ideas. The voice that emerges from their translation is a universal one that stands within the stream of the wisdom traditions of every historic faith. While rooted in the Stoic philosophy of Greece and Rome, it is recognizable to students of early Christianity and Buddhism, of the Vedas and the Talmud, and to all who seriously search for meaning in contemporary life. The translators' selection process has also been guided by the intention of making Marcus's thought vividly accessible to the general reader. They frame the translation with concise, relevant introductions that tell who Marcus was and provide a fresh, while historically grounded, way of entering this deeply powerful work. Also included are a glossary of terms; spare yet helpful notes that do not cloud the text; and recommendations for further reading.",1585426172,9781585426171),Paperback,,111 pages,"

In Bostchelan, Coquette knew happiness, and as much contentment as a young woman whose heart had been broken years before could know. Thus, Coquette dwelt in gladness until the day her father returned from his travels with an astonishing tale to tell. Antoine de Bellamont returned from his travels by way of Roanan bearing a tale of such great adventure to hardly be believed. Further, at the center of Antoine's story loomed a man-the dark Lord of Roanan. Known for his cruel nature, heartlessness, and tendency to violence, the Lord of Roanan had accused Antoine de Bellamont of wrong doing and demanded recompense. Antoine had promised recompense would be paid-with the hand of his youngest daughter in marriage. Thus, Coquette found herself lost-thrust onto a dark journey of her own. This journey would find her carried away to Roanan Manor-delivered into the hands of the dark and mysterious Lord of Roanan who dominated it.",0971338973,9780971338975),Paperback,,272 pages,"

It is the story of a young orphan realizing his destiny -- to become the legendary Kris Kringle.Unlike the traditional Santa Claus myth, KRINGLE is a coming-of-age story about an orphan who becomes a force for good in a dark and violent time. It is a tale of fantasy, of goblins, elves, and flying reindeer -- and of a boy from the humblest beginnings who fulfills his destiny.Our tale begins in 500 A.D., when goblins kidnapped human children and set them to work in underground mines. Kringle is one such child.... until he discovers his mission - to free children from enslavement.

","The sequel to Thomas Wolfe's remarkable first novel, Look Homeward, Angel, Of Time and the River is one of the great classics of American literature. The book chronicles the maturing of Wolfe's autobiographical character, Eugene Gant, in his desperate search for fulfillment, making his way from small-town North Carolina to the wider world of Harvard University, New York City, and Europe. In a massive, ambitious, and boldly passionate novel, Wolfe examines the passing of time and the nature of the creative process, as Gant slowly but ecstatically embraces the urban life, recognizing it as a necessary ordeal for the birth of his creative genius as a writer.  The work of an exceptionally expressive writer of fertile imagination and startling emotional intensity, Of Time and the River illuminates universal truths about art and life, city and country, past and present. It is a novel that is majestic and enduring. As P. M. Jack observed in The New York Times, ""It is a triumphant demonstration that Thomas Wolfe has the stamina to produce a magnificent epic of American life.""  This edition, published in celebration of Wolfe's centennial anniversary, contains a new introduction by Pat Conroy.",0684867850,9780684867854),Hardcover,,896 pages,"

","A serial killer stalks the streets of Spokane, acting out a misogynist script from the dark heart of this culture. Across town, a writer named Derrick has spent his life tracking the reasons—political, psychological, spiritual—for the sadism of modern civilization. And through the grim nights, Nika, a trafficked woman, tries to survive the grinding violence of prostitution. Their lives, and the forces propelling them, are about to collide. Derrick’s current project is a book called Possession, which asks the ontological question of who is responsible for the culture of domination that’s destroying the earth. Who actually benefits from a dead planet, the endgame that’s fast approaching? What if the answer is something way bigger than humans? Meanwhile, with motivations opposite to Derrick’s, the serial killer is asking much the same question of the women he kidnaps as his final act of possession—and Nika is next.  Derrick’s metaphysical explorations suddenly take on more urgency as visions both terrifying and sacred begin to intrude, and past and future collapse without warning. All Derrick knows is Nika’s name and her impending death. The only person who believes him is his partner Allison, a woman with both strengths and scars, whose past has led her to a commitment to justice no matter what the cost.  As the visions intensify and the killer draws nearer, Derrick and Allison are compelled to act, making themselves the next targets. Derrick must learn to negotiate a world of spirits and demons, living and dead, before it’s too late. And what hangs in the balance is not just their lives, but also the fate of life on earth. With Songs of the Dead, Derrick Jensen has written more than a thriller. This is a story lush with rage and tenderness on its way to being a weapon.",1604860448,9781604860443),Paperback,,320 pages,"

Two childhood friends from Scotland and two illegitimate half-brothers from the American South suffer and enjoy all manner of bizarre experiences which, as it turns out, are somehow interconnected and, surprisingly enough, meaningful. An eclectic cast of characters includes Carl Jung, Fatty Arbuckle, Virgil, Marat, Socrates, and Tony Randall. Love, greed, hope, revenge, organized religion, and Hollywood are alternately tickled and throttled. Impossible to summarize and impossible to stop reading, this is a romantic comic odyssey that actually delivers and rewards.",0811858197,9780811858199),Paperback,,329 pages,"

","Now from the author the Washington Post Book World calls ""the dark chronicler of human vanity and folly"" comes Celebration. The newest black comedy from Harry Crews is a biting, brilliant commentary set in a Florida rest-home gulag where the over-sixty-five set checks its dignity, self-esteem, and social security numbers at the door. Forever and Forever is the aptly named retreat, populated by a motley crew of forgotten wives and ruined men who are waiting for death while working on their tans. The leader of this group is Stump, whose lost arm paid for Forever and Forever, and who believes the silent desperation that infuses the trailer park masks the fact that Forever and Forever is truly a small piece of hell on earth. This ironic silence is shattered by the entrance of a beautiful young bombshell. Too Much is her name, and that is exactly what she is. This walking bonfire awakens long dead appetites in the inhabitants of Forever and Forever, reminding them of what they once were and can be again—alive.",0684848104,9780684848105),Paperback,,272 pages,"

When Paul accepted the call to pastor the struggling church, he had no idea what to expect. But it didn’t take long for Paul to turn Centerville Christian Church around. Attendance is up, way up, and everything is going so well. If only his wife, Eunice, could see it that way. Still, he tries not to let her quiet presence distract him. But Eunice knows that something isn’t right . . . and it hasn’t been for a long time.The more Paul’s zeal and ambition builds, the more he loses sight of the One who called him.

Margo Sullivan had everything a young woman could ask for. But while growing up along the rocky cliffs of Monterey, she couldn't help but dream of bigger things. The daughter of the Templeton's stern Irish housekeeper, Margo had been treated like a member of the family. Deep down, she knew that money could not buy the thing she craved most -- her mother's acceptance. Maybe things would be different if she could be sweet like Laura -- or had Kate's shrewd head for business. But all Margo knew how to do was be Margo, and that meant doing things her own way -- no matter what the consequences . . .",0515142905,9780515142907),Mass Market Paperback,,376 pages,"

He populated it with generations of families that had escaped the Appalachians in search of more room, greener pastures, freedom from convention, sweeter air and water, or, simply, a world where time and history do not matter. In Enduring, Harington continues the themes of the Stay More series and reveals, for the first time, the mysteries of the life of Latha Bourne, the heroine and demigoddess of Lightning Bug, The Choiring of the Trees, and other Harington classics. Latha is set apart from her fellow Stay Morons, as Harington affectionately calls them, by her beauty, wit, mystery, and intense, unfullfilled sexuality.",159264256X,9781592642564),,,499 pages,"

Naked, writhing bodies… Detective Daniel Reed was the last person to speak to Patsy.  What he reveals to Alex is shocking. Twenty-five years earlier, Patsy was married to Harlan Sommer, one of Sonoma County’s most prominent vintners, when their infant son disappeared without a trace.  The loss destroyed the Sommers’ marriage, causing Patsy to leave and take Alex with her. A dead child… Called on to investigate the identity of a baby’s remains unearthed in a Sonoma vineyard, Reed had picked up a trail that led him to Patsy in San Francisco.  Now Reed and Alex both wonder if the cold bones could be her baby brother Dylan, and Alex decides to accompany Reed back to Sonoma for the investigation.  No sooner does she arrive, however, than she is drawn deep into the search for a twisted killer…",0312363923,9780312363925),Hardcover,,338 pages,"

But it won't, because Misha's late Beloved Papa whacked an Oklahoma businessman of some prominence. Misha is paying the price of exile from his adopted American homeland. He's stuck in Russia, dreaming of his beloved Rouenna and the Oz of NYC. Salvation may lie in the tiny, oil-rich nation of Absurdistan, where a crooked consular officer will sell Misha a Belgian passport. But after a civil war breaks out between two competing ethnic groups and a local warlord installs hapless Misha as Minister of Multicultural Affairs, our hero soon finds himself covered in oil, fighting for his life, falling in love, and trying to figure out if a normal life is still possible in the twenty-first century. Populated by curvaceous brown-eyed beauties, circumcision-happy Hasidic Jews, a loyal manservant who never stops serving, and scheming oil execs from a certain American company whose name rhymes with Malliburton, Absurdistan is a strange, oddly true-to-life look at how we live now, from a writer who should know.",0812971671,9780812971675),Paperback,,333 pages,"

","In the eighteen-nineties and for years thereafter, America reverberated with the name of the ""notorious Anarchist,"" feminist, revolutionist and agitator, Emma Goldman. A Russian Jewish immigrant at the age of 17, she moved by her own efforts from seamstress in a clothing factory to internationally known radical lecturer, writer, editor and friend of the oppressed. This book is a collection of her remarkably penetrating essays, far in advance of their time, originally published by the Mother Earth press which she founded.In the first of these essays, Anarchism: What It Really Stands For, she says, ""Direct action, having proven effective along economic lines, is equally potent in the environment of the individual."" In Minorities Versus Majorities she holds that social and economic well-being will result only through ""the non-compromising determination of intelligent minorities, and not through the mass."" Other pieces deal with The Hypocrisy of Puritanism; Prisons: A Social Crim and Failure; The Psychology of Political Violence—note the relevence of these themes to our own time; The Drama: A Powerful Disseminator of Radical Thought; Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty; and The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation. A biographical sketch by Hippolyte Havel precedes the essays.Anarchism and Other Essays provides a fascinating look into revolutionary issues at the turn of the century, a prophetic view of the social and economic future, much of which we have seen take place, and above all, a glimpse into the mind of an extraordinary woman: brilliant, provocative, dedicated, passionate, and what used to be called ""high-minded.""Unabridged republication of the 3rd (1917) edition, with a new Introduction by Richard Drinnon.

","Iris Greenfeder, ABD (All But Dissertation), feels the “buts” are taking over her life: all but published, all but a professor, all but married. Yet the sudden impulse to write a story about her mother, Katherine Morrissey, leads to a shot at literary success. The piece recounts an eerie Irish fairy tale her mother used to tell her at bedtime—and nestled inside it is the sad story of her death. It captures the attention of her mother’s former literary agent, who is convinced that Katherine wrote one final manuscript before her strange, untimely end in a fire thirty years ago. So Iris goes back to the remote Hotel Equinox in the Catskills, the place where she grew up, to write her mother’s biography and search for the missing manuscript—and there she unravels a haunting mystery, one that holds more secrets than she ever expected. . . .",0345450914,9780345450913),Paperback, Ballantine Reader's Circle,400 pages,"

","""Of all my novels this bright brute is the gayest,"" writes Vladimir Nabokov in his Foreword to this revised and first English-language edition of a classic story. The setting is Berlin in the late 1920s: ""An unprepossessing sullen little café…a lady in a moleskin coat…a young man in tortoise-shell glasses, sipping cherry brandy and gazing into each other's eyes.""The lady in the fur coat is Martha Dreyer. The myopic young man is Franz, her bumbling lover and her husband's nephew. Her husband, oblivious to their meeting, plods on with his money-making schemes. Martha, ""strictly adhering to every rule of adultery,"" is clumsily plotting her husband's murder so that she and Franz may live happily forever after on his money.Husband, wife, paramour—the classic triangle but, as in any Nabokov novel, the geometry is hardly plane. As soon as Martha decides on the murderous solution the strange and hilarious workings of the god of chance begin. Plot and subplot start their intricate courtship, and one of the most icily brilliant novels you have ever read is well underway.King, Queen, Knave will long remain the masterful, comic statement on classic bourgeois romance by the man whom Eliot Fremont-Smith has called ""the greatest literary artist working today.""",0679723404,9780679723400),Paperback,Vintage International,272 pages,"

But when Chelsea shows up for her summer job at Essex Historical Colonial Village (yes, really), it turns out Ezra’s working there too. Which makes moving on and forgetting Ezra a lot more complicated…even when Chelsea starts falling for someone new. Maybe Chelsea should have known better than to think that a historical reenactment village could help her escape her past. But with Ezra all too present, and her new crush seeming all too off limits, all Chelsea knows is that she’s got a lot to figure out about love.

","What would you do if you were kissed by the most handsome stranger you'd ever seen? And what if that man was a Cynster?Every girl--even convent-educated ones--dreams of forbidden kisses. So when a man literally falls at Helena's feet as she's walking through the courtyard one moonlit Christmas Eve, the pretty, young comtesse d'Lisle knows he's up to no good. He's clearly a bit dangerous... and obviously caught in the middle of a clandestine rendezvous. Why else would he have risked his neck and jumped out of a window into the snow?It's wrong, it's outlandish . . . and it's the most utterly romantic gesture she's ever seen. So when the good sisters rush up, demanding to know if she has seen a man on the grounds, Helena ignores the years of strict upbringing that insist she reveal his presence.To lie would be a sin, but no one can be good all the time.As a reward for her silence, the stranger takes her in his arms and enticingly, unforgettably kisses her--and then departs, leaving a lingering if unspoken promise of all that might be, should fate decree that they meet again. Although Helena doesn't know it, her wild Englishman is Sebastian Cynster, Duke of St. Ives, a nobleman who will prove to be her destiny.Seven years later, Helena has been transformed from a pretty schoolgirl to an aristocratic beauty. Her sparkling wit has made her sought after by London's hostesses; her considerable dowry has made winning her hand the aim of many a gentleman . . . but she is deadeningly aware of how boring so many of these gentlemen are.Her manipulative guardian has unexpectedly allowed her to find a husband of her own choosing, and she has no intention of marrying any man who tries to tame her. There must be someone perfect for her . . . someone who can live up to the promise of that long-ago kiss.Then, at a ball, fate strikes. Once again, it is the Christmas season, and across the crowded room Helena stands transfixed . . . for there is the man whose kiss she has never forgotten, the man of her memory whom no other has ever been able to supplant. Her wild, mysterious Englishman, Sebastian Cynster, Duke of St. Ives.One look, and he's determined to reclaim her . . . .",0061031755,9780061031755),Paperback,,377 pages,"

Uneducated and socially repressed, many of these young women found themselves alone and frightened on distant shores, with no familial or spiritual support.In 1892, Sir Wilfred Grenfell, a young British doctor, answered the call from Britain's oldest North American colony to treat the appalling social conditions among the livyers of Labrador and the Newfoundlanders who prosecuted the Labrador cod-fishery. During that first season, Grenfell's medical ship the Albert was blown into Indian Tickle, where Grenfell encountered a young woman in great distress, under the care of a well-intentioned but misguided fishing captain.From Grenfell's medical files, Earl B. Pilgrim has crafted another classic in Newfoundland literature, in the tradition of Will Anyone Search for Danny? and Curse of the Red Cross Ring.",1894463188,9781894463188),Paperback,,151 pages,"

","""Written with precise skill and beautifully controlled power. The translation by Ivan Morris is outstanding."" —The New York Times**Winner of the 1952 Yomiuri Prize**This haunting novel explores the complete degradation and isolation of a man by war. Fires on the Plain is set on the island of Leyte in the Philippines during World War II, where the Japanese army is disintegrating under the hammer blows of the American landings. Within this broader disintegration is another, that of a single human being, Private Tamura. The war destroys each of his ties to society, one by one, until Tamura, a sensitive and intelligent man, becomes an outcast.Nearly losing the will to survive, he hears of a port still in Japanese hands and struggles to walk through the American lines. Unfazed by danger, he welcomes the prospect of dying, but first, he loses his hope, and then his sanity. Lost among his hallucinations, Tamura comes to fancy himself an angel enjoined by God to eat no living thing—but even angels fall.Tamura is never less than human, even when driven to the ultimate sin against humanity. Shocking as the outward events are, the greatness of the novel lies in its uplifting vision during a time of crushing horror. As relevant today as when it was originally published, Fires on the Plain will strike a chord with anyone who has lived through the horrors of war.",0804813795,9780804813792),Paperback,,246 pages,"

","In his first case since he left the LAPD's Open Unsolved Unit for the prestigious Homicide Special squad, Harry Bosch is called out to investigate a murder that may have chilling consequences for national security. A doctor with access to a dangerous radioactive substance is found murdered in the trunk of his car. Retracing his steps, Harry learns that a large quantity of radioactive cesium was stolen shortly before the doctor's death. With the cesium in unknown hands, Harry fears the murder could be part of a terrorist plot to poison a major American city.Soon, Bosch is in a race against time, not only against the culprits, but also against the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI (in the form of Harry's one-time lover Rachel Walling), who are convinced that this case is too important for the likes of the LAPD.

He examines the new federal law requiring prospective fathers to free themselves from their self-made macho prisons--to laugh, cry, love and just generally behave like certified wimps.Dave also reveals, for the first time in print, the secret chant for painless childbirth.Then learn why no secret chant could possibly take a woman's mind off the fact that she is in such pain that she wants a gigantic comet to crash into the earth and kill her and her husband and the dotor and the nurses and everyone else in the world.",0878575103,9780878575107),Paperback,,96 pages,"

Abandoned by her rapacious, conniving mother when she was only three days old, Avery was raised by her grandmother and beloved aunt Carolyn. Then, when she was eleven, she witnessed her grandmother's violent death, before Avery herself was shot and left for dead. Miraculously she survived. The man responsible is serving time in a Florida prison. This traumatic experience propels Avery into a life of law and order.Her razor-sharp mind and ability to gather data and decipher evidence has made Avery an expert crime analyst for the FBI. But soon she will have to use every one of her adroit skills on a case that hits painfully close to home.Avery's workaholic aunt, Carolyn Salvetti, is certain her (hopefully soon-to-be ex) husband sent her the gold embossed reservation to the posh Utopia Spa in the mountains of Colorado. At first she is resistant, but then figures it will be a welcome respite from the cutthroat advertising business, not to mention a networking extravaganza. Plus she persuades her niece to join her for the two weeks of luxury and decadence.But Carolyn never makes it to Utopia. Under false pretenses, she is taken to an isolated retreat by a handsome stranger with a dazzling smile, suave demeanor, and the darkest of motives. His name is Monk, a hired assassin. Now, with scant clues and fewer resources, Avery must track down and save Carolyn--and outmaneuver a brilliant killer who is part of an elaborate plot of madness and lethal vengeance.",0345486447,9780345486448),Paperback,,448 pages,"

In the retelling, Olympus becomes small-town Olinger High School; Chiron is George Caldwell, a science teacher there; and Prometheus is Caldwell’s fifteen-year-old son, Peter. Brilliantly conflating the author’s remembered past with tales from Greek mythology, John Updike translates Chiron’s agonized search for relief into the incidents and accidents of three winter days spent in rural Pennsylvania in 1947. The result, said the judges of the National Book Award, is “a courageous and brilliant account of a conflict in gifts between an inarticulate American father and his highly articulate son.”",0449912167,9780449912164),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Dublin 1907, a city of whispered rumours. A young actress begins an affair with a damaged older man, the leading playwright at the theatre where she works. Rebellious and flirtatious, Molly Allgood is a girl of the inner city tenements, dreaming of stardom in America. She has dozens of admirers but in the backstage of her life there is a secret.Her lover, John Synge, is a troubled genius, the son of a once prosperous landowning family, a poet of fiery language and tempestuous passions. Yet his life is hampered by convention and by the austere and God-fearing mother with whom he lives. Scarred by a childhood of loneliness and severity he has long been ill, but he loves to walk the wild places of Ireland. The affair, sternly opposed by friends and family, is turbulent, sometimes cruel, often tender.Many years later, an old woman makes her way across London on the morning after a hurricane. Christmas is coming. As she wanders past bombsites and through the city's forlorn beauty, a snowdrift of memories and lost desires seems to swirl. She has twice been married: once widowed, once divorced, but an unquenchable passion for life has kept her afloat as her dazzling career has faded.A story of love's commitment, of partings and reconciliations, of the courage involved in living on nobody else's terms, Ghost Light is a profoundly moving and ultimately uplifting novel.",English,English,Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","In a Toronto library, home to the mad and the marginalized, notes appear, written by someone who believes he is Rigoletto, the hunchbacked jester from Verdi’s opera. Convinced that the young librarian, Miriam, is his daughter, he promises to protect her from grief. Little does he know how much loss she has already experienced; or does he?The Incident Report, both mystery and love story, daringly explores the fragility of our individual identities. Strikingly original in its structure, comprised of 140 highly distilled, lyric “reports,” the novel depicts the tensions between private and public storytelling, the subtle dynamics of a socially exposed workplace.The Incident Report is a novel of “gestures,” one that invites the reader to be astonished by the circumstances its characters confront. Reports on bizarre public behaviour intertwine with reports on the private life of the novel’s narrator. Shifting constantly between harmony and dissonance, elegant in its restraint and excitingly contemporary, The Incident Report takes the pulse of our fragmented urban existence with detachment and wit, while a quiet tragedy unfolds.",1897141254,9781897141250),Paperback,,195 pages,"

","With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies.Oliver Onions is unique in the realms of ghost story writers in that his tales are so far ranging in their background and substance that they are not easily categorised. His stories are powerfully charged explorations of psychical violence, their effects heightened by detailed character studies graced with a powerful poetic elegance. In simple terms Oliver Onions goes for the cerebral rather than the jugular. However, make no mistake, his ghost stories achieve the desired effect. They draw you in, enmeshing you in their unnerving and disturbing narratives.This collection contains such masterpieces as The Rosewood Door, The Ascending Dream, The Painted Face and The Beckoning Fair One, a story which both Algernon Blackwood and H. P. Lovecraft regarded as one of the most effective and subtle ghost stories in all literature. Long out of print, these classic tales are a treasure trove of nightmarish gems.",English,English,Paperback,,657 pages,"

","After they met in 1922, Vita Sackville-West, a British novelist married to foreign diplomat Harold Nicolson, and Virginia Woolf began a passionate relationship that lasted until Woolf’s death in 1941. Their revealing correspondence leaves no aspect of their lives untouched: daily dramas, bits of gossip, the strains and pleasures of writing, and always the same joy in each other’s company. This volume, which features over 500 letters spanning 19 years, includes the writings of both of these literary icons.DeSalvo and Leaska established the chronological order of the letters and placed them in sequence, and they have also included relevant diary entries and letters Vita and Virginia wrote to other friends where they add context and illumination to the narrative. Annotations throughout the text identify peripheral characters, clarify allusions, and provide background. As the New York Times noted, ""the result is a volume that reads like a book, not just a gathering of marvelous scraps.""In his introduction Mitchell A. Leaska observes, ""Rarely can a collection of correspondence have cast into more dramatic relief two personalities more individual or more complex; and rarely can an enterprise of the heart have been carried out so near the verge of archetypal feeling.""",1573441961,9781573441964),Paperback,,480 pages,"

","In this powerful call to action, Oscar-nominated film star Don Cheadle and human rights advocate John Prendergast shine an unsparing spotlight on the genocide in Darfur -- a targeted ethnic extermination chillingly described as ""Rwanda in slow motion."" The authors explore the roots of the current crisis, recount the stories of their separate and combined involvements, and suggest practical strategies every American can implement to end the death and destruction in Darfur and prevent the next attempted genocide. Transcending the bounds of memoir or history, Not on Our Watch is nothing short of a field guide to citizen activism. Its practical strategies for effecting grassroots change could easily be adopted to serve other worthy causes.

The poor and innocent have nothing to fear from him; often they profit from his spontaneous generosity. The rich and powerful, and the detective who tries to spoil his fun, however, must beware. They are the target of Arsene’s mischief and tomfoolery. A masterful thief, his plans frequently evolve into elaborate capers, a precursor to such cinematic creations as Ocean’s Eleven and The Sting.

Controlled all her life by a dominating father whose wealth influenced his actions and prejudices, Faith spent her teen years defying every rule Lionel Morgan made.BUDDY LEE WALKER is Boyd Walker’s son and mad as hell about it. He hasn’t been anybody’s boy since his mama died when he was six. When his no-account daddy went to prison for a bungled bank robbery and armed assault, sixteen-year-old Buddy Lee shouted “Hallelujah!” and set about working hard to overcome his reputation as Boyd’s boy. The first time Buddy Lee took the blame for one of Faith’s escapades to save her from her daddy’s wrath, she knew she had a friend forever. Buddy Lee knew he’d have alligators snapping at his heels from that night on, but he didn’t care. Being Faith’s friend was the only good thing going on in his life right then. The worst thing was falling in love with her. Buddy Lee Walker loves his Mustang - the 1965 red one, that is! He's no cowboy, but he's a Texan with a heart as big as the Lone Star State.

Her canvas is monumental -- the Nazis' 1941 winter siege on Leningrad that killed six hundred thousand -- but her focus is heartrendingly intimate. One family, the Levins, fights to stay alive in their small apartment, held together by the unlikely courage and resourcefulness of twenty-two-year-old Anna. Though she dreams of an artist's life, she must instead forage for food in the ever more desperate city and watch her little brother grow cruelly thin. Their father, a blacklisted writer who once advocated a robust life of the mind, withers in spirit and body. At such brutal times everything is tested. And yet Dunmore's inspiring story shows that even then, the triumph of the human heart is that love need not fall away.",0802139582,9780802139580),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","In The Coming of Dragons, Edmund and Elspeth received magical gifts that would lead them into a perilous adventure. Edmund has the vision of the Ripente-he can see through the eyes of others, and Elspeth can draw upon an enchanted sword when she is in danger. Now, the sword is speaking to Elspeth, leading her to a final showdown with an ancient god, bound inside a mountain. The journey into the Snowlands will be fraught with dangers, from terrifying dragons to haunting ice spirits and these two unlikely heroes must together decide who they can trust and who means them harm. Elspeth's magical sword has brought them closer to their destiny than they realize, and it's up to them to succeed-at all costs.www.thedarkestage.com",1599900394,9781599900391),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","Autora de la recién descubierta Suite francesa, publicada póstumamente y aclamada por la crítica y el público de media Europa, Irène Némirovsky mostró desde muy joven un talento excepcional. Con veintisiete años de edad, Némirovsky saltó a la fama con esta breve joya literaria sobre la venganza de una adolescente, editada en Francia en 1930 y traducida al castellano en 1986. Instalados en un lujoso piso de París, los Kampf poseen todo lo que el dinero puede comprar, excepto lo más difícil: el reconocimiento de la alta sociedad francesa. Así pues, con el propósito de obtener el codiciado premio, preparan un gran baile para doscientos invitados, un magno acontecimiento social que para el señor y la señora Kampf supondrá, respectivamente, una excelente inversión y la soñada apoteosis mundana.Pero en casa de los Kampf no todos comparten el mismo entusiasmo. Herida en su orgullo por la prohibición materna de asistir al ágape, Antoinette, de catorce años, observa con amargura los agitados preparativos del baile y siente que ha llegado la ocasión de enfrentarse a su madre, afirmarse a sí misma y realizar su propia entrada en la edad adulta. Con un breve gesto, tan impulsivo como espontáneo, provoca una situación absurda que culminará en un final dramático y revelador. Dotada de una afilada percepción psicológica, Némirovsky condensa en pocas páginas una historia donde la difícil relación madre-hija y el ansia de reconocimiento social se funden con la pasión por la vida y la búsqueda de la felicidad. Una obra indispensable de uno de los grandes escritores del siglo XX.",8498380235,9788498380231),Paperback,,94 pages,"

","In the city of Aramanth, the mantra is, ""Better today than yesterday. Better tomorrow than today."" Harder work means the citizens of Aramanth can keep moving forward to improved life stations--from Gray tenements and Orange apartments, upwards to glorious mansions of White. Only some families, like the Haths, believe more in ideas and dreams than in endless toil and ratings. When Kestrel Hath decides she is through with the Aramanth work ethic, she is joined in her small rebellion by her twin brother Bowman and their friend Mumpo. Together, they set the orderly city on its ear by escaping Aramanth's walls for an adventure that takes them from city sewers to desert sandstorms. Guided by an archaic map, they know that if they can find the voice of the Wind Singer, an ancient and mysterious instrument that stands in the center of Aramanth, they can save their people from their dreamless existence. But the voice is guarded by the dreaded Morah and its legion of perfect killing machines, the Zars. Are three ragtag kids any match for an army of darkness?  Like Lois Lowry's The Giver and Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass, The Wind Singer is a rich, multilayered fantasy that can be read on many levels. With this first volume of a planned trilogy, British author William Nicholson deftly illustrates such fundamental values as tolerance and the importance of individuality, without sacrificing a bit of the novel's breathless adventure. Watch out, J.K. Rowling! If the rest of The Wind on Fire trilogy is as amazing as this debut, Nicholson's books may be the next hot English export.

","‘One of the greatest prose writers in Urdu' - India Today The Bride's Mirror (mirat ul-‘arus) was the first bestseller in Urdu. First published in 1869, within twenty years it had gone into several editions and sold over 100, 000 copies. An English translation was published in England in 1903 by G. E. Ward and the book has been almost continuously in print ever since. The novel tells the story of two sisters, asghari and akbari, who are married to two brothers in Delhi. Akbari, the spoilt, mean-tempered and impetuous sister, fritters away all the advantages she is offered and makes a mess of her life. Asghari, who has to contend with all sorts of disappointments and setbacks, prevails in the end and makes a success of everything she turns her hand to. All through its existence, the bride’s mirror had been hailed as one of the most important works of Urdu literature ever published. The portrait it provides of the lives of those who lived in Delhi over a hundred years ago is an indelible one.",8178240211,9788178240213),Hardcover,,223 pages,"

","These six incendiary arguments about money, religion, war, power, culture and nature constitute a wake-up call about the need for justice. George Monbiot is admired for his unquenchable thirst for truth and an assured nose for spin. In this series of essays on money, religion, war, power, culture and nature, he explains why we are heading into an uncertain future in which peace and sound politics are paramount to our survival. From his attack on the countries that deny the existence of global warming to his rally against the injustices of the Iraq war, Monbiot turns his gaze on the aspects of modernity that most endanger the prevailing world order. With characteristic precision, he offers unassailable proof that the desecration of the resources on which we all depend threatens the peace, equality - and very existence - of humanity. Bring on the Apocalypse is an urgent wake-up call that we cannot afford to ignore.",1843546566,9781843546566),Paperback,,242 pages,"

Though she’s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twenty-something, she’s still not what you would call “ordinary.” For one thing, there’s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there’s the fact that she sees ghosts. Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show’s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle’s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a horrific mystery that unravels the threads of Perry’s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.",1461079853,9781461079859),Paperback,2nd Edition,346 pages,"

","The Snowman's Children is a poignant, psychologically intense first novel that tells the story of an incident from one man's childhood in the 1970s, when a serial killer called The Snowman stalked the streets of suburban Detroit. The incident, a result of good but woefully misguided juvenile intentions, forced his family to leave their home, and eventually forced him, at age twenty-nine, to return to his hometown in search of three old friends. Reminiscent of both To Kill a Mockingbird in its touching portrait of childhood, and the beautifully written brand of suspense that calls to mind Smilla's Sense of Snow, The Snowman's Children is an unusually controlled and original novel that establishes Hirshberg as an important new voice in American literature.",0786710829,9780786710829),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","James Weldon Johnson's emotionally gripping novel is a landmark in black literary history and, more than eighty years after its original anonymous publication, a classic of American fiction.The first fictional memoir ever written by a black person, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man influenced a generation of writers during the Harlem Renaissance and served as eloquent inspiration for Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, and Richard Wright. In the 1920s and since, it has also given white readers a startling new perspective on their own culture, revealing to many the double standard of racial identity imposed on black Americans.Narrated by a mulatto man whose light skin allows him to ""pass"" for white, the novel describes a pilgrimage through America's color lines at the turn of the century--from a black college in Jacksonville to an elite New York nightclub, from the rural South to the white suburbs of the Northeast.This is a powerful, unsentimental examination of race in America, a hymn to the anguish of forging an identity in a nation obsessed with color. And, as Arna Bontemps pointed out decades ago, ""the problems of the artist [as presented here] seem as contemporary as if the book had been written this year.""",0809000326,9780809000326),Paperback,(American Century Series),212 pages,"

Elaine inherited not only her grandmother’s red hair but also her feisty spirit, big heart, and love of the land. When William Martyn, a handsome young Irishman of questionable integrity, walks into her life, she succumbs rapidly to his charms. Only to have her heart broken when her sensual half-Maori cousin Kura Warden arrives for a visit and draws William away. Though both young women must endure hardships and disappointments as they learn to live with the choices they make, each of them also discovers an inner resilience—and eventually finds love and happiness in new, unexpected places. Tested by the harsh realities of colonial life, both girls mature into spirited young women with a greater understanding of the challenges—and joys—of love, friendship, and family.",1477807675,1477807675,Kindle Edition,,704 pages,"

","The Rapture has occurred, just as the Bible predicted. The faithful have risen up to Heaven. Those left behind are in a living hell. Earth burns, hell-like in its oppressive heat. Every volcano in the world has erupted, and tsunamis and earthquakes continue to devastate the planet. Clouds continually rain ash onto the scorched landscape, sparking fires all around. Plants and animals are dying. Food is scarce. The night sky is devoid of stars, and the moon - when it can be seen - is the colour of blood. The remnants of humanity fight for survival. Most have fled the cities and now hide in caves deep in the mountains. By night, demons stalk the Earth, capturing the remaining humans and killing them - if they're lucky. The less fortunate are converted to worship of the Devil, and ushered into endless hell. Eighteen year old Sam is unable to rise up because he is half demon. Hikari, a Japanese sword master and demon expert and his beautiful daughter, Aimi, have been all the family Sam has ever known. Now they're gone, and Sam must set out on the mission Hikari charged him with long ago: to help all the humans left behind. Armed only with his beloved Japanese swords and his wits, Sam wanders the post-apocalyptic world alone, separated forever from everyone he loves. Cursed by his demonic heritage, he must now embark on a quest that will take him across the US to the City of Angels. There he will confront his destiny. There he must fight to save a friend ... and the souls of the living.",English,English,Mass Market Paperback,1st Edition,300 pages,"

But with the pain he also gives us hope and an illuminating example of how the best sort of love can actually be strengthened through the shared experience of a life-threatening ordeal.

","HOW HARD CAN IT BE?One happy ending coming right up…************************************************* What happens when an accountant decides to grab life by the horns and try something new? Apparently a pirate named Dave, a lot of pastel fleece, and blackmail—just to start with…Visualize and succeed, Oprah said. I was sure as hell trying, even if my campaign to score a job as the local weather girl had ended in a restraining order. Okay, TV was not my strength. But a lack of talent has never stopped me before. Which is why I’ve embarked on a writing career. I mean, how hard can it be to come up with a sexy romance?Leave it to me to wind up in a group of grandmotherly porno writers who discuss sex toys and apple cobbler in the same breath. Also leave it to me to leak an outlandish plot idea to a bestselling author with the morals of a rabid squirrel. And only I could get arrested for a jewelry heist I didn’t commit—by a hunky cop whose handcuffs just might tempt me to sign up for a life of crime. Maybe I’ve found my calling after all…",9781601830623,9781601830623,ebook,,278 pages,"

","One of the duties parents owe their children is to guide them aright by educating them. They should correct their children's errors and most importantly guide them to live a life that is pleasing to Allah and teach them a means of achieving it. Allah points these duties to parents, particularly the fathers, In His book (the Qur'aan) when he gave the example of Luqmaan and his son. 'And (remember) when Luqmaan said to his while he was advising him: ""O my son! join not in worship others with Allah. Verily! joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed. ""Luqmaan (31:13). Our success as parents is determined largely by how well we are able to discharge those responsibilities Allah has placed on us regarding out children. this book explains different aspects of the advice of Luqmaan to his son and its significance for a successful life.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,63 pages,"

","Plagued by waking visions and nightmares, inexplicably drawn to the bones of dead animals, Faye thinks she's going crazy. Fast. Her parents believe Holbrook Academy might just be the solution. Dr. Mordoch tells her it's the only answer. But Faye knows that something's not quite right about Dr. Mordoch and her creepy, prisonlike school for disturbed teenagers.What's wrong with Holbrook goes beyond the Takers, sadistic guards who threaten the student body with Tasers and pepper spray; or Nurse, who doles out pills at bedtime and doses of solitary confinement when kids step out of line; or Rita, the strange girl who delivers ominous messages to Faye that never seem to make any sense. What's wrong with Holbrook begins and ends with Faye's red hands; she and her newfound friends - her Holbrook ""Family"" - wake up every morning with their hands stained the terrible brown red of dried blood. Faye has no idea what it means but fears she may be the cause.Because despite the strangeness of Holbrook and the island on which it sits, Faye feels oddly connected to the place; she feels especially linked to the handsome Kel, who helps her unravel the mystery. There's just one problem: Faye's certain Kel's trying to kill her - and maybe the rest of the world, too.A rich and tautly told psychological thriller, Harbinger heralds the arrival of an exciting new voice in young adult fiction.",English,English,Hardcover,First Edition,309 pages,"

","Renowned primatologist Robert Sapolsky offers a completely revised and updated edition of his most popular work, with nearly 90,000 copies in print	 Now in a third edition, Robert M. Sapolsky's acclaimed and successful Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress.	As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear-and the ones that plague us now-are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way-through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. 	Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses. This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet.",0805073698,9780805073690),Paperback,Third Edition,560 pages,"

","At the start of the 22nd century, a race of godlike beings--the Elar--awaken after countless eons of slumber, and decide the purpose of their existence is to subdue all other life forms. On Earth, humankind has seemingly evolved into one peaceful, prosperous society--but in fact, it is only the calm before the storm. For ""God"" and ""the Devil"" are actually real, and have begun appointing human agents to oppose each other with unprecedented powers. And out in space, a mysterious ""rift"" has suddenly appeared, and soon alien spaceships emerge from it to head straight for Earth. With the aliens is one of the Elar, calling himself Eli, whose agenda is entirely unknown, for it seems he has turned renegade against his brethren. Yet there are even bigger issues to consider than the Earth becoming a battleground of gods. The Purple Rift is a wound in the cosmos which has begun to break down the dimensional integrity of all space and time. If it is not mended, soon there will be chaos beyond imagining; in fact, even life and death may cease to have meaning. The only hope for salvation rests with several young men and women who learn they have the unique, awesome ability to channel Spiritual Energy, also known as the Blood of the Universe. With this power, they must find a way to close the Purple Rift, thus restoring balance. There is just one problem: as long as the Rift exists, the Channellers are prevented from being able to control their power...",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,158 pages,"

","Times are tough in Western Australia. There's a war on, though nobody will call it that yet. Dan, injured in the line of duty, now takes in orphaned children until the Red Cross can find a place for them. He's become an old hand at looking after the kids, running his little hand crank radio, and just surviving. That is until Sid rolls up to his house on a motorcycle, claiming to be the uncle of the baby girl Dan is currently looking after. It isn't that Dan doesn't believe Sid, it's just that the man knows nothing about taking care of babies and Dan doesn't see how Sid is going to manage taking the child across the outback on his bike. Heavy bombing in the area prompts Dan to flee eastward with Sid and the baby, but neither Sid nor the baby are your ordinary humans and the so-called police action is becoming more and more of a war every day. Will Dan and his companions survive the army, magicians, the war, the outback, and, worst of all, Sid's relatives becoming something more than they are?",1603705899,9781603705899),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","A BOLD NEW VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF BUSINESS, FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE DREAM SOCIETY THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT THE FUTURE. Your future. Our future.

We've managed to achieve many of our material goals, only to face ever-growing global competition in an ever-slowing economy. Here's the good news: With the rise of social media and online resources, consumers are growing more powerful. Individuals are exploring more options.

You'll explore revolutionary ways in which the individual's role will shift from consumer to creator--much like it did during the European Renaissance. You'll find out why learning will become the world's largest industry and how services will become the twenty-first century's biggest growth market.

","The rousing story of the last gasp of human agency and how today’s best and brightest minds are endeavoring to put an end to it. It used to be that to diagnose an illness, interpret legal documents, analyze foreign policy, or write a newspaper article you needed a human being with specific skills—and maybe an advanced degree or two. These days, high-level tasks are increasingly being handled by algorithms that can do precise work not only with speed but also with nuance. These “bots” started with human programming and logic, but now their reach extends beyond what their creators ever expected. In this fascinating, frightening book, Christopher Steiner tells the story of how algorithms took over—and shows why the “bot revolution” is about to spill into every aspect of our lives, often silently, without our knowledge. The May 2010 “Flash Crash” exposed Wall Street’s reliance on trading bots to the tune of a 998-point market drop and $1 trillion in vanished market value. But that was just the beginning. In Automate This, we meet bots that are driving cars, penning haiku, and writing music mistaken for Bach’s. They listen in on our customer service calls and figure out what Iran would do in the event of a nuclear standoff. There are algorithms that can pick out the most cohesive crew of astronauts for a space mission or identify the next Jeremy Lin. Some can even ingest statistics from baseball games and spit out pitch-perfect sports journalism indistinguishable from that produced by humans. The interaction of man and machine can make our lives easier. But what will the world look like when algorithms control our hospitals, our roads, our culture, and our national security? What hap­pens to businesses when we automate judgment and eliminate human instinct? And what role will be left for doctors, lawyers, writers, truck drivers, and many others?  Who knows—maybe there’s a bot learning to do your job this minute.",1591844924,9781591844921),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother is made up of the stories of Chinese mothers whose daughters have been wrenched from them, and also brings us the voices of some adoptive mothers from different parts of the world. These are stories which Xinran could not bring herself to tell previously - because they were too painful and close to home. In the footsteps of Xinran's Good Women of China, this is personal, immediate, full of harrowing, tragic detail but also uplifting, tender moments.Ten chapters, ten women and many stories of heartbreak, including her own: Xinran once again takes us right into the lives of Chinese women - students, successful business women, midwives, peasants, all with memories which have stained their lives. Whether as a consequence of the single-child policy, destructive age-old traditions or hideous economic necessity... these women had to give up their daughters for adoption, others were forced to abandon them - on city streets, outside hospitals, orphanages or on station platforms - and others even had to watch their baby daughters being taken away at birth, and drowned. Here are the 'extra-birth guerrillas' who travel the roads and the railways, evading the system, trying to hold onto more than one baby; naive young student girls who have made life-wrecking mistakes; the 'pebble mother' on the banks of the Yangzte still looking into the depths for her stolen daughter; peasant women rejected by their families because they can't produce a male heir; and finally there is Little Snow, the orphaned baby fostered by Xinran but 'confiscated' by the state.The book sends a heartrending message from their birth mothers to all those Chinese girls who have been adopted overseas (at the end of 2006 there were over 120,000 registered adoptive families for Chinese orphans, almost all girls, in 27 countries), to show them how things really were for their mothers, and to tell them they were loved and will never be forgotten.",0701184027,9780701184025),Hardcover,,224 pages,"

","Godimento del tempo e dei luoghi, il camminare è uno scarto rispetto alla modernità. Viaggiare a piedi è un gesto trasgressivo, una potente affermazione di libertà. È un avanzare in modo trasversale nel ritmo frenetico della vita moderna, consente di prendere le distanze e affilare i sensi. Con la piacevolezza di un racconto, Il mondo a piedi propone un modo nuovo di viaggiare, mette in relazione il punto di vista di personaggi storici quali Stevenson, Sansot e Basho, ponendoli attorno a un tavolo immaginario a scambiarsi opinioni sul senso del percorrere il mondo e la vita a piedi. Un libro originale, una breve, piacevole dissertazione che induce a considerare con curiosità un aspetto ormai insolito del viaggio.“Vorrei dire di quel modo di andare che induce un piacere viscerale, che stimola l’incontro, la conversazione, la gioiosa fruizione del tempo, la libertà di fermarsi o di continuare. Il mio è un invito al piacere, non una guida per far bene. Celebra quietamente la gioia del pensare e del camminare.”",8807817608,9788807817601),Paperback,Universale economica traveller,120 pages,"

","In Conversations with Wilder, Hollywood's legendary and famously elusive director Billy Wilder agrees for the first time to talk extensively about his life and work.Here, in an extraordinary book with more than 650 black-and-white photographs -- including film posters, stills, grabs, and never-before-seen pictures from Wilder's own collection -- the ninety-three-year-old icon talks to Cameron Crowe, one of today's best-known writer-directors, about thirty years at the very heart of Hollywood, and about screenwriting and camera work, set design and stars, his peers and their movies, the studio system and films today. In his distinct voice we hear Wilder's inside view on his collaborations with such stars as Barbara Stanwyck, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, William Holden, Audrey Hepburn, and Greta Garbo (he was a writer at MGM during the making of Ninotchka. Here are Wilder's sharp and funny behind-the-scenes stories about the making of A Foreign Affair, Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard, Love in the Afternoon, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, and Ace in the Hole, among many others. Wilder is ever mysterious, but Crowe gets him to speak candidly on Stanwyck: ""She knew the script, everybody's lines, never a fault, never a mistake""; on Cary Grant: ""I had Cary Grant in mind for four of my pictures . . . slipped through my net every time""; on the ""Lubitsch Touch"": ""It was the elegant use of the super-joke."" Wilder also remembers his early years in Vienna, working as a journalist in Berlin, rooming with Peter Lorre at the Chateau Marmont -- always with the same dry wit, tough-minded romanticism, and elegance that are the hallmarks of Wilder's films. This book is a classic of Hollywood history and lore.",0375709673,9780375709678),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","This is part 4 of 4 in a paranormal romance serialTwo years ago, voluptuous she-wolf Aspen ran from her shifter pack. With females of her kind getting increasingly rare, she knew if she stayed she'd be pressured into mating with Rafe, the gorgeous, blue-eyed son of the alpha. Not that she hasn't always adored him, but she couldn't stand the thought of a mating of convenience. Now she's back, on the run from a dangerous stalker and emitting pheromones that make every wolf nearby want to claim her. But this time, Rafe is determined she'll be his. He just needs to convince her that he has always wanted her, and it was never about convenience.Important note from the author! Alpha Games is a paranormal romance serial about a female wolf shifter and the three sexy alphas she's destined to choose between. The story is told in novella length episodes with cliffhangers, and is free through Kindle Unlimited. If you aren't getting it that way, I've priced each part low enough that by the time you have purchased all parts, you'll only have paid the price of one book . I know that this format isn't for everyone, but I love serials and find they keep things exciting for me as a writer. I hope you enjoy if you decide to still read it.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,57 pages,"

","Музиката край леглото ми“, претърпял две преиздания в родината на автора, е болезнена изповед на главната героиня, чиято драматична история пресъздава перипетиите на една невъзможна, неосъществима любов, белязана от реалните събития през 60-те години в Турция, от един военен преврат, свалил от власт правителството на Аднан Мендерес и осъдил на смърт немалко министри. Такъв е и любимият на главната героиня - съпруга на дипломат, от чието име Кюршат Башар води своя разказ. Анкара, Истанбул, Лондон, Париж, Венеция са градовете убежища за откраднатите и грижливо кътани мигове на мимолетното щастие.Понякога си мислим, че сме в някаква фантазия, а всъщност изживяваното от нас е реалност. Понякога, възприемайки всичко като реалност, не осъзнаваме, че виждаме една фантазия. Описаното в тази книга е реалност. И същевременно е лъжа.

She's also a talented seamstress. As the young woman sits with her elderly patients, she quietly sews as they share their stories. She's content with her life until circumstances reconnect her with someone she once loved.

","In the riverside town of Green Cove Springs, Florida, the freshwater spring at the city park briefly turns blood-red, startling onlookers. Moments later, the last of the discolored water flows into the stream and empties into the river. Only one man knows this event is a prelude to evil. Dr. Curt Lohan and Scott Marks return in the sequel to “Death in the Beginning” when they discover a hidden cave near the St. Johns River. The cave contains remnants of an ancient cross-oceanic expedition by one of the most enigmatic civilizations that ever inhabited the Earth. As sinister characters emerge in the small town and people begin to disappear, the terrifying truth becomes evident: the magnificent archaeological site holds a dark secret that has been unleashed on the world. PRAISE FOR GARY WILLIAMS & VICKY KNERLY: INDISPUTABLE PROOF“It is obvious the amount of research and detail that went into the writing of this story. The writing is creative, thought-provoking and seemingly effortless. I highly recommend this book to all readers. It’s a story that will keep you totally immersed and take you places that will astound you.” —Marilou George, The Kindle Book ReviewDEATH IN THE BEGINNING (THE GOD TOOLS: BOOK 1)""Science, spirituality and the supernatural collide in this break-out debut thriller, with an action-packed storyline so tightly woven, you won’t be able to catch your breath until the very end. It’s a delicious, twisting journey unlike any I have read.” —CK Webb, co-author of “Cruelty to Innocents” and “Collecting Innocents”THREE KEYS TO MURDER “Three Keys to Murder” is a riveting roller coaster ride, complete with non-stop action, intriguing characters, and an amazing plot line. Up until now, I’ve always thought that “The Da Vinci Code” had the perfect flow for a murder mystery novel, sending the lead character on a quest to connect history with artifacts, but in retrospect, I think “Three Keys to Murder” might just top “The Da Vinci Code.” Thus, if you’re a lover of “The Da Vinci Code,” then Williams’ and Knerly’s novel is a must read! Five stars.” —Shana Benedict of A Book Vacation Reviews: Favorite Books Read in 2012MANIPULATION“Manipulation” is a twisting, turning story exposing the most primal aspects of human behavior. It’s a classic tale of greed and lust, told with a fresh perspective that drives the story at a frenetic pace. You won’t see the ending coming. Williams and Knerly have done it again!” —Allison Leotta, author of “Speak of the Devil”",English,English,Kindle Edition,,326 pages,"

","Au Japon, à Nagoya et à Tokyo, de nos jours et seize ans plus tôt. Depuis le mois de juillet de sa deuxième année d'université jusqu'au mois de janvier de l'année suivante, Tsukuru Tazaki vécut en pensant presque exclusivement à la mort.A Nagoya, Tsukuru Tazaki avait quatre amis. Le premier s'appelait Akamatsu, on le surnommait Mr Red ; le deuxième était Ômi, Mr Blue ; la troisième, Shirane, était Miss White et la dernière, Kurono, Miss Black. Tsukuru Tazaki, lui, était sans couleur. Tsukuru est parti à Tokyo ; les autres sont restés. Et un jour, ils l'ont appelé et lui ont dit qu'ils ne voulaient plus jamais le voir ni lui parler. Sans explications. Lui-même n'en a pas cherché. Pendant un temps, Tsukuru Tazaki a vécu comme Jonas dans le ventre de la baleine, comme un mort qui n'aurait pas encore compris qu'il est mort. Tsukuru est devenu architecte, ingénieur, designer ; il construit des gares. Aujourd'hui, Tsukuru Tazaki a rencontré Sara. Elle veut comprendre ce cercle d'amis, elle pense que Tsukuru ne sera jamais tranquille tant qu'il ne saura pas pourquoi il a été chassé. Alors, Tsukuru va partir en pèlerinage, à Nagoya d'abord, où vivent encore deux membres du groupe, et jusqu'en Finlande, où habite Kuro, Miss Black.

","In this captivating novel of romantic suspense, New York Times bestselling author Linda Howard brings us deep into the wild, where a smart and sexy outdoor guide and her ruggedly handsome competitor must join forces to survive—and avoid becoming what they never expected to be: PREY Thirty-two-year-old Angie Powell has always spoken her mind, but in the presence of Dare Callahan she nurses a simmering rage. After all, why give Dare the satisfaction of knowing he can push her buttons and push her to the edge?Three years ago, Dare returned home to rural western Montana and opened a hunting business to rival Angie’s. Complicating matters is the fact that Dare has asked Angie out (not once but twice) and has given her a gift of butterflies in the process. Angie has no patience for butterflies. They only lead to foolish decisions. And now the infuriatingly handsome Iraq war vet has siphoned away Angie’s livelihood, forcing her to close up shop. Before Angie is to leave town, she organizes one last trip into the wilderness with a client and his guest, who wants to bag a black bear. But the adrenaline-fueled adventure turns deadly when Angie witnesses a cold-blooded murder and finds herself on the wrong side of a loaded gun. Before the killer can tie up this attractive loose end, a bear comes crashing through the woods—changing the dark game completely.Luckily, Dare is camping nearby and hears the shots. Forced together for their very survival, Angie and Dare must confront hard feelings, a blinding storm, and a growing attraction—while being stalked by a desperate killer and a ferocious five-hundred-pound beast. And neither will stop until they reach their prey.From the Hardcover edition.",0307577651,9780307577658),Audio CD,,12 pages,"

Haunted by her failures, country police officer Detective Isabelle O'Connell is recalled to duty by Detective Alec Goddard to investigate the abduction of yet another child from her old home town.With the killer playing a game of cat and mouse and targeting Bella, they have only days in which to find the girl alive, but they have very few clues, a whole town of suspects, and a vast wilderness to search. For Bella, this case is already personal; for Alec his best intentions to keep it purely professional soon dissolve. He starts to think of the missing child as if she were his own, and his anguish over Bella’s safety moves beyond the just his concern for a colleague. Their mutual attraction leaves them both vulnerable to their private nightmares – nightmares that the killer ruthlessly exploits.For more information on Bronwyn Parry’s debut novel, AS DARKNESS FALLS, please visit the website: www.asdarknessfalls.com.au ",0733623220,9780733623226),Trade paperback,,352 pages,"

Cole is arrogant, flamboyant, and definitely not Jon’s type. Still, when Cole suggests an arrangement of getting together for casual sex whenever they're both in town, Jon readily agrees. Their arrangement may be casual, but Jonathan soon learns that when it comes to Cole Fenton, nothing is easy. Between Cole’s fear of intimacy and his wandering lifestyle, Jonathan wonders if their relationship may be doomed from the start—but the more Cole pushes him away, the more determined Jon is to make it work.Coda: Which book do I read first?",1615815511,9781615815517),ebook,,242 pages,"

","Dave Robicheaux has spent his life confronting the age-old adage that the sins of the father pass onto the son. But what has his mother's legacy left him? Dead to him since youth, Mae Guillory has been shuttered away in the deep recesses of Dave's mind. He's lived with the fact that he would never really know what happened to the woman who left him to the devices of his whiskey-driven father. But deep down, he still feels the loss of his mother and knows the infinite series of disappointments in her life could not have come to a good end.While helping out an old friend, Dave is stunned when a pimp looks at him sideways and asks him if he is Mae Guillory's boy, the whore a bunch of cops murdered 30 years ago. The pimp goes on to insinuate that the cops who dumped her body in the bayou were on the take and continue to thrive in the New Orleans area.Dave's search for his mother's killers leads him to the darker places in his past and solving this case teaches him what it means to be his mother's son.

SELECTED ONE OF THE TOP 10 BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times • Entertainment Weekly • The Christian Science Monitor • The Kansas City Star • Library JournalWeaving a brilliant latticework of family legend, loss, and love, Téa Obreht, the youngest of The New Yorker’s twenty best American fiction writers under forty, has spun a timeless novel that will establish her as one of the most vibrant, original authors of her generation.In a Balkan country mending from years of conflict, Natalia, a young doctor, arrives on a mission of mercy at an orphanage by the sea. By the time she and her lifelong friend Zóra begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.But Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather’s recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel. Grief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather’s final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. On their weeklytrips to the zoo he would read to her from a worn copy of Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, which he carried with him everywhere; later, he told her stories of his own encounters over many years with “the deathless man,” a vagabond who claimed to be immortal and appeared never to age. But the most extraordinary story of all is the one her grandfather never told her, the one Natalia must discover for herself. One winter during the Second World War, his childhood village was snowbound, cut off even from the encroaching German invaders but haunted by another, fierce presence: a tiger who comes ever closer under cover of darkness. “These stories,” Natalia comes to understand, “run like secret rivers through all the other stories” of her grandfather’s life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.From the Hardcover edition.",0307877000,9780307877000),Audio CD,,11 pages,"

","Though the Serbian pack has been brought to heel thanks to the downfall of their Alpha, the war is far from over. Desdemona, a witch of unfathomable power, has escaped the wolves' wrath, but she will not go quietly into the night. She takes refuge in a place where even the smallest sliver of light does not dare to enter. Though she had to flee, she has not given up on the treasure she wishes to acquire. Her depravity knows no bounds; she's even willing to search for the one who can assist her in opening a Veil that has not been opened in millennia - with good reason: the danger is incalculable. Meanwhile, there are major changes rippling through the Romanian Grey wolves. Decebel has become Alpha to the Serbian pack in an effort to begin to unite the Canis lupis species. Their numbers are dwindling in the wake of the shortage of true mates and lack of offspring. The wolves are beginning to lose faith and darkness seems to be crashing in on them from all sides. But the winds of change are blowing, changes that will alter the future of not only the Canis lupis, but of another ancient race as well. Amidst all of this, Sally is continuing to come to terms with her relationship with the playful, charming, flirty, unbelievably handsome bartender - who happens to be a member of the Romanian pack. If all that weren't enough, the Fates have decided to pay a little visit to Jen. It's time to collect. She cheated the Fates of a life, her life. Now they want what they are due. The problem? It's more than Jen is willing to pay. Yes, the war is indeed far from over. Bargains will be struck, declarations will be made, sacrifices will be given, love will be tested, and trust will be questioned as evil makes its stand against them all.",1480267015,9781480267015),Paperback,,232 pages,"

","2t 40mFor femte og sidste gang står der problemer på menuen for Neanderslottets beboere. Eller det vil sige tidligere beboere, for fundamentet er sunket sammen, og slottet ligger under vand. Samtidig er Mummy ved at tabe sine sidste bandager. Hvis han mister dem alle, dør han (igen). Staklen fryser nu så seriøst, at han skal have hjælp hurtigt. Heldigvis er Freddy med på den med det samme, så turen går til Egypten efter de originale bandager til Mummy. Efter en længere kamp lykkedes det da også for selskabet at komme frem til pyramiderne, og her viser Mummy hidtil ukendte sider af sig selv. Hans omtågede sind klarer op, og han viser sig som en uvurderlig hjælp, da de forvilder sig ind i den dødsensfarlige pyramide. Han er dog ikke så klar i hovedet, at det ikke lykkedes selskabet at blive spredt for alle vinde i det labyrintiske indre.",Danish,Danish,Paperback,,106 pages,"

The problem is, she thinks she’s in a dream but she’s actually taken the place of the parallel universe Cora and without realizing it, our Cora does something that starts a centuries old curse that will sweep the land if she gets captured by the evil Minerva.  At this point, her dream world becomes a nightmare.  Luckily, hot guy, fantasyland Noctorno is there to save her from the clutches of the grotesque vickrants sent by Minerva to capture her. Unfortunately, hot guy, fantasyland Noctorno doesn’t like the Cora of his world all that much (to say the least) and he thinks our Cora is her. And no matter what our Cora says or does to try to convince him, he won’t be convinced.  But Cora needs Tor to keep her safe and guide her through this fantastical world as she hopes one day to wake up in her not-so-great apartment in her not-so-great life in her world.

Joe, now a battle hardened veteran, has spent his life surviving wars he had no right to survive. Yet his real test is coming: New forces are conspiring to start a great war like the universe has never been seen, one that would rip apart the very fabric of Congress. Joe is conscripted to fight the very war everyone has been fearing since the rise of the Dhasha—the war against the legendary Dhasha Vahlin. Unfortunately for Joe, at the same time, other ruthless powers are conspiring to kill him before he fulfills the prophecy of the Trith.To fight the Vahlin, a desperate Congress comes up with a tactic it abandoned millennia ago—the use of multi-species groundteams. Joe, now a Prime Commander, is given command of his own team of misfits and pitted against the Vahlin’s forces in a war whose casualties are millions-to-one. Can Joe keep his group of aliens from killing each other long enough to make them into a battle-ready team? Will he survive long enough to kill the Vahlin?

","Presenting an original take on women’s safety in the cities of twenty-first century India, Why Loiter? maps the exclusions and negotiations that women from different classes and communities encounter in the nation’s urban public spaces.Basing this book on more than three years of research in Mumbai, Shilpa Phadke, Sameera Khan and Shilpa Ranade argue that though women’s access to urban public space has increased, they still do not have an equal claim to public space in the city. And they raise the question: can women’s access to public space be viewed in isolation from that of other marginal groups?Going beyond the problem of the real and implied risks associated with women’s presence in public, they draw from feminist theory to argue that only by celebrating loitering—a radical act for most Indian women—can a truly equal, global city be created.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,280 pages,"

","Artist-writer-director-producer Hayao Miyazaki is often called ""the Walt Disney of Japan."" His animated theatrical features have been smash hits in Japan, and many, including My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, are already familiar to American audiences. Now, with Disney-Miramax's imminent release of Princess Mononoke,, Miyazaki's masterwork and one of the top-grossing film in all Japanese history, this ""animation master"" is about to take America and the world by storm.Mixing first-hand interview and personal insights with critical evaluations of art, plot, production qualities, and literary themes, McCarthy provides a film-by-film appraisal that examines technique as well as message. She reveals Miyazaki to be not just a master of the art of animation, but a meticulous craftsman who sees his work as a medium for shaping the humanistic and environmental concerns of our times.An overview of the artist and his early career is followed by in-depth examinations of seven major Miyazaki films: Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Princess Mononoke. Included are design and technical data, story synopses and character sketches, personnel and filmography data, and critical evaluation. Illustrations throughout, in color and black and white, show the detail and vigor of Miyazaki's art.Written for anime fans as well as students of film, literature, and popular culture, McCarthy's book raises animation criticism to a whole new level and is an essential guide to the work of a world-class filmmaker.London-based Helen McCarthy is author of Anime! A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Animation, The Anime Movie Guide, and (with Jonathan Clements) The Erotic Anime Movie Guide. She appears frequently on radio and TV and at conferences around the world.",1880656418,9781880656419),Paperback,First Edition,240 pages,"

When he shows up one day to extort money from her, threatening both her and her teenaged daughter Misato, the situation quickly escalates into violence and Togashi ends up dead on her apartment floor.

Cuando imitaba a la literatura, a las películas, a la poesía. Descubre a la Fosa en la dispersión de sus sueños y en un lugar de su cerebro que ha bautizado como el mercado de la imaginación. Quiso tener lucidez en el desorden. Lanzó un grito de dolor en la soledad de su habitación. Y la Fosa acudió, con la magia perfecta para relacionarse con el prójimo. Con la dosis exacta para que el extranjero la ame. Con la locura fascinante del bello buscador.

Las fórmulas, los descubrimientos, y el aullar emocional no son suficientes. Ahí aparece el contenedor de toda su ansiedad humana. El servilismo divino al que está sometida por un extraño compromiso de vivir plenamente.

","Nina and Eddie have been thinking about taking a break to start a family. The IHA has nothing major going on at the moment and Nina has been offered a large advance to write a book-it might be the perfect time for a sabbatical. But those dreams are quickly dashed when the new U.N. liaison calls an emergency meeting to announce that a Viking runestone has been stolen from a Swedish museum, and that the heist was led by none other than a mole operating within the IHA itself. Nina and Eddie are immediately on the scene, where they learn from the museum's Norse expert, Tova Skilfinger, that the runestone reveals the secret of how to reach Valhalla-a great hall that, according to myth, houses a god-killing poison known as eitr. Using IHA resources on top of Tova's meticulous knowledge, Nina is able to deduce the location of the runestone-it's in Norway-but at the bottom of an isolated lake. As the team comes closer to excavating the artifact, it becomes increasingly obvious to Nina that Eddie knows more about the mission than he's letting on. In fact, his connection to it is buried deep within his past-in the dense, sweltering jungles of Vietnam-and he knows that to find Valhalla is to unleash a grave danger upon the world. This pulse-pounding adventure will take Nina and Eddie to the vast reaches of the earth in a race against time as they strive to prevent rival forces from unleashing a wave of mass destruction that would threaten the fate of humanity forever.Listening Length: 15 hours and 54 minutes",0755380657,9780755380657),Paperback,,560 pages,"

But when Henry of Anjou, the young and dynamic future king of England, arrives at the French court, he and the seductive Eleanor experience a mutual passion powerful enough to ignite the world. Indeed, after the annulment of Eleanor’s marriage to Louis and her remarriage to Henry, the union of this royal couple creates a vast empire that stretches from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees—and marks the beginning of the celebrated Plantagenet dynasty. But Henry and Eleanor’s marriage, charged with physical heat, begins a fiery downward spiral marred by power struggles and bitter betrayals. Amid the rivalries and infidelities, the couple’s rebellious sons grow impatient for power, and the scene is set for a vicious and tragic conflict that will threaten to engulf them all.",0345511875,9780345511874),Hardcover,,473 pages,"

","In 1762, John Adams penned a flirtatious note to ""Miss Adorable,"" the 17-year-old Abigail Smith. In 1801, Abigail wrote to wish her husband John a safe journey as he headed home to Quincy after serving as president of the nation he helped create. The letters that span these nearly forty years form the most significant correspondence--and reveal one of the most intriguing and inspiring partnerships--in American history.As a pivotal player in the American Revolution and the early republic, John had a front-row seat at critical moments in the creation of the United States, from the drafting of the Declaration of Independence to negotiating peace with Great Britain to serving as the first vice president and second president under the U.S. Constitution. Separated more often than they were together during this founding era, John and Abigail shared their lives through letters that each addressed to ""My Dearest Friend,"" debating ideas and commenting on current events while attending to the concerns of raising their children (including a future president).Full of keen observations and articulate commentary on world events, these letters are also remarkably intimate. This new collection--including some letters never before published--invites readers to experience the founding of a nation and the partnership of two strong individuals, in their own words. This is history at its most authentic and most engaging.",0674026063,9780674026063),Hardcover,,508 pages,"

But on this particular Monday morning, the first person he meets at the school gate is no other than Yuzuru Shino, Seryou’s senpai at the archery club. On a whim, and well-aware of Seryou’s reputation, Shino asks Seryou to go out with him. Thinking that it will be treated as a joke, they’re both guys after all, imagine Shino’s surprise when Seryou takes him up on the offer! There is a catch, though. While Seryou does go out with the first girl who asks him out on a Monday morning, the other side of the coin is – by the end of the week, he will break up with that person.

In these thirteen essays and one remarkable extended interview, the man widely regarded as the most brilliant theoretical physicist since Einstein returns to reveal an amazing array of possibilities for understanding our universe. Building on his earlier work, Hawking discusses imaginary time, how black holes can give birth to baby universes, and scientists’ efforts to find a complete unified theory that would predict everything in the universe. With his characteristic mastery of language, his sense of humor and commitment to plain speaking, Stephen Hawking invites us to know him better—and to share his passion for the voyage of intellect and imagination that has opened new ways to understanding the very nature of the cosmos.",0553374117,9780553374117),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","Bodyguard Celia Graves plies her trade in a world where bloodthirsty vampires roam the night and street-corner psychics have real powers. A vamp attack turned Celia into a unique creature who finds sunlight painful and who must take all her food in liquid form—but who still retains her human heart, mind, and soul.The attack also awakened a hidden part of her heritage: Celia is part Siren, able to enthrall men…and enrage women…without half-trying. Needless to say, her bodyguard business has taken off: who wouldn’t want to be protected by a sexy, extremely capable woman who is half-vampire, half-Siren princess?An ancient rift between the demonic dimension and our own, sealed during the destruction of Atlantis, begins to open and threatens to loose all the demons of hell on humanity (including the one personally bent on destroying Celia). Celia’s recent hellish experiences may have given her the unique combination of abilities needed to close the rift. But to overcome a death curse that nearly guarantees her failure, she’ll need to join forces with people she no longer trusts…and put people she has come to care about directly in harm’s way.",0765324962,9780765324962),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","From best-selling and award-winning author Kevin Brockmeier: a new novel of stunning artistry and imagination about the wounds we bear and the light that radiates from us all.What if our pain was the most beautiful thing about us? In the aftermath of a fatal car accident, a private journal of love notes written by a husband to his wife passes into the keeping of a hospital patient, and from there through the hands of five other suffering people, touching each of them uniquely. I love the soft blue veins on your wrist. I love your lopsided smile. I love watching TV and shelling sunflower seeds with you.  The six recipients - a data analyst, a photojour­nalist, a schoolchild, a missionary, a writer, and a street vendor - inhabit an acutely observed, beauti­fully familiar yet particularly strange universe, as only Kevin Brockmeier could imagine it: a world in which human pain is expressed as illumination, so that one's wounds glitter, fluoresce, and blaze with light. As we follow the journey of the book from stranger to stranger, we come to understand how intricately and brilliantly they are connected, in all their human in­jury and experience.",0375425314,9780375425318),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

En Sophia, de trots van haar familie, verstaat haar vak. Dan kondigt grootmoeder Tereza, de mater familias, aan dat het bedrijf gaat fuseren met de wijngaard van de MacMillans. Sophia wacht een andere taak. Op zichzelf heeft Sophia daar niet zoveel bezwaar tegen, ware het niet dat ze nu is gedwongen nauw samen te werken met Tyler MacMillan. Sophia moet hem de kneepjes van haar vak bijbrengen, Ty wordt op zijn beurt geacht Sophia bij te brengen waar het bij wijn echt over gaat: alleen druiven van de beste kwaliteit, op het juiste moment en de juiste manier geoogst, leveren de topkwaliteit waar beide huizen befaamd om zijn. Hoewel Sophia zich meteen sterk tot Ty aangetrokken voelt, beschouwt ze hem tegelijk als haar grootste rivaal. Als onverwacht door sabotage de reputatie van het familiebedrijf teloor dreigt te gaan, verandert er nog meer in het leven van Sophia.

","What, exactly, do you know about your body? Do you know how your immune system works? Or what your pancreas does? Or the myriad -- and often simple -- ways you can improve the way your body functions? This full-color, visually rich guide answers these questions and more. Matthew MacDonald, noted author of Your Brain: The Missing Manual, takes you on a fascinating tour of your body from the outside in, beginning with your skin and progressing to your vital organs. You'll look at the quirks, curiosities, and shortcomings we've all learned to live with, and pick up just enough biology to understand how your body works. You'll learn:That you shed skin more frequently than snakes do Why the number of fat cells you have rarely changes, no matter how much you diet or exercise -- they simply get bigger or smaller How you can measure and control fat That your hair is made from the same stuff as horses' hooves That you use only a small amount of the oxygen you inhale Why blood pressure is a more important health measure than heart rate -- with four ways to lower dangerously high blood pressure Why our bodies crave foods that make us fat How to use heart rate to shape an optimal workout session -- one that's neither too easy nor too strenuous Why a tongue with just half a dozen taste buds can identify thousands of flavors Why bacteria in your gut outnumbers cells in your body -- and what function they serve Why we age, and why we can't turn back the clock What happens to your body in the minutes after you die Rather than dumbed-down self-help or dense medical text, Your Body: The Missing Manual is entertaining and packed with information you can use. It's a book that may well change your life.Reader comments for Your Brain: The Missing Manual, also by author Matthew MacDonald: ""Popular books on the brain are often minefields of attractive but inaccurate information. This one manages to avoid most of the hype and easy faulty generalizations while providing easy to read and digest information about the brain. It has useful tricks without the breathless hype of many popular books."" -- Elizabeth Zwicky, The Usenix Magazine ""...a unique guide that should be sought after by any who want to maximize what they can accomplish with their mental abilities and resources."" -- James A. Cox, The Midwest Book Review - Wisconsin Bookwatch ""If you can't figure out how to use your brain after reading this guide, you may want to return your brain for another."" -- The Sacramento Book Review, Volume 1, Issue 2, Page 19 ""It's rare to find a book on any technical subject that is as well written and readable as Your Brain: The Missing Manual. The book covers pretty much anything you may want to know about your brain, from what makes it up, through how it develops to how to mitigate the affects of aging. The book is easy reading, fact packed and highlighted notes and practical applications. So if you want to learn more about your brain, how it works, how to get the best out of it or just want to stave off the ravages of Alzheimers (see chapter ten for details of how learning helps maintain your brain) then I can't recommend this book highly enough."" -- Neil Davis, Amazon.co.uk ""MacDonald's writing style is perfect for this kind of guide. It remains educational without becoming overly technical or using unexplained jargon. And even though the book covers a broad scope of topics, MacDonald keeps it well organized and easy to follow. The book captures your attention with fun facts and interesting studies that any person could apply to their own understanding of human ability. It has great descriptions of the brain and its interconnected parts, as well as providing full color pictures and diagrams to offer a better explanation of what the author is talking about."" -- Janica Unruh, Blogcritics Magazine",0596801742,9780596801748),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","For the first time in one volume--two complete novels set on the remarkable world of Doona, by two of the most acclaimed literary imaginations.More than twenty-five years ago, the first humans came to the unspoiled planet of Doona. They ignored one important fact: They were not alone. Doona was the home of the catlike alien race of Hrrubans. And so began an experiment in cohabitation that lasted for a quarter of a century.Their contract is now up for renewal.Now, the wild planet they tamed, the home they fought for, and the delicate alliance they share could be destroyed forever as a new threat looms. The Gringgs are not the first alien visitors to the planet, but they are the first to offer friendship--and a proposal for a prosperous future. But not everyone trusts the new guests. Not everyone believes in their motives. And as a battle of diplomatic unrest ensues, Doona once again falls under the dark shadow of uncertainty--and self-destruction.""An excellent read.""--Locus""[McCaffrey and Nye] blend their skills effectively to produce a brisk, well-told...tale.

","A short story is the perfect tool for promoting your novel. Readers who love your story will look for more fiction by the same author.  Here are some ideas: post a story on your website as a free read or give it to another writer of the same genre to display it on their website. Publish it as a short free ebook, bolstering your list of published books. Offer it as a giveaway on blog tours. Submit it to a magazine, ezine or anthology where it will get read by lovers of your genre.  This book is structured like a workshop, based on an online class I taught. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll build your story step by step, from the spark of an idea to the polished version that will wow your readers and make them eager to buy your novel.  For powerful promotion, writing a great story is not enough. It needs to be a particular kind of story to target your audience, win fans and sell books.  To get the most from this book, you should have at least one novel to promote, whether traditionally or indie-published. You need to have mastered the basics of the fiction writer’s craft, though not necessarily of the short story form.  If you’re a fiction writing novice or are still working on your first novel, it’s too soon to follow this programme, although you may find useful inspiration.  If you enjoy writing, and if you have a novel you want to promote, you’ve come to the right place.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,101 pages,"

She believes that a vast conspiracy exists to hide the horrific truth about parenting from doe-eyed expectant mothers who might otherwise abandon their babies in hospitals and run for it. In The Sh!t No One Tells You, Dais tells it like it is, revealing what it’s really like to be a new parent and providing helpful insights, humor, and hope for those who feel overwhelmed by the exhausting trials they’re suddenly facing. Eschewing the adorableness that oozes out of other parenting books, Dais offers real advice from real moms—along with hilarious anecdotes, clever tips, and the genuine encouragement every mom needs in order to survive the first year of parenthood.",1580054846,9781580054843),Paperback,,264 pages,"

","Fernando Pessoa was many writers in one. He attributed his prolific writings to a wide range of alternate selves, each of which had a distinct biography, ideology. and horoscope. When he died in 1935, Pessoa left behind a trunk filled with unfinished and unpublished writings, among which were the remarkable pages that make up his posthumous masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet, an astonishing work that, in George Steiner's words, ""gives to Lisbon the haunting spell of Joyce's Dublin or Kafka's Prague.""Published for the first time some fifty years after his death, this unique collection of short, aphoristic paragraphs comprises the ""autobiography"" of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's alternate selves. Part intimate diary, part prose poetry, part descriptive narrative, captivatingly translated by Richard Zenith, The Book of Disquiet is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.",B002RI9X8I,B002RI9X8I,Kindle Edition,,548 pages,"

These three regiments of the 1st Marine Division--strung out along eighty miles of a narrow mountain road--soon found themselves completely surrounded by 60,000 Chinese soldiers.

It's been just her and her father, and she's been okay with that. But then she overhears him calling someone Honey -- and suddenly it feels like everyone in Royal has a secret. It's up to Melody and her best friend, Nick, to piece together the clues and discover why Honey is being hidden.   Meanwhile, a dog named Mo is new to Royal. He doesn't remember much from when he was a puppy . . . but he keeps having dreams of a girl he is bound to meet someday.

",".When the great Seattle fire of 1889 leaves them with nothing to lose, two very different women discover a mutual passion for revenge. Chicago socialite and art patron Geneva Langley has brought scandal to her family for the last time. Her latest and boldest act of immodesty is too much for her father to bear, and he banishes her to Seattle, along with her scheming, ambitious husband, Nathan. Seattle is a far cry from Chicago—the streets are muddy, the society backward, and Ginny feels stifled and alone. Despite her considerable talent, Beatrice Wilkes is an actress whose dream of being a leading lady is fading rapidly. She can’t believe her luck when a new production gives her a chance at stardom, but Geneva Langley seizes the opportunity for her own and unwittingly crushes Bea’s last dream. The two women engage in a fierce battle for center stage, but the great Seattle fire, which ravages the city, changes their fates and plans. In its aftermath, Ginny and Bea see an opportunity to change their lives: but it would mean banding together to enact a truly wicked plan. Their dark and perilous alliance will set them on the path to either redemption or damnation.From the Trade Paperback edition.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,450 pages,"

","The Blind Assassin opens with these simple, resonant words: ""Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge."" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist. Brilliantly weaving together such seemingly disparate elements, Atwood creates a world of astonishing vision and unforgettable impact.",0385720955,9780385720953),Paperback,,521 pages,"

","It is almost impossible to envision what childhood would be like without the enchanting world of fairyland. Princes and princesses, kings and queens, giants and dwarfs, monsters and magicians, fairies and ogres — these are the companions who thrill young boys and girls of all lands and all times, as Andrew Lang's phenomenally successful collections of stories have proved. From the day that they were first printed, the Lang fairy books of many colors have entertained thousands of boys and girls, as they have also brought pleasure to the many parents who have read these unforgettable classics to their children.The Crimson Fairy Book contains a fascinating collection of tales from many countries: Hungary, Russia, Rumania, Finland, Iceland, Japan, and Sicily are only some of them. Filled with imagination, excitement, and adventure, these tales will delight children with their illogical yet strangely reasonable events, and will offer parents a pleasant change from the well-worn favorites. One story — ""The Cottager and His Cat"" — tells of how cats were introduced into Iceland; another Japanese tale — ""The Crab and the Monkey"" — tells how a crab gets the best of a roguish monkey; and a remarkable tale — ""Little Wildrose"" — from Rumania tells how a beautiful child was reared in an eagle's nest.All in all, the collection contains 36 stories, all narrated in the clear, lively prose for which Lang was famous. Not only are Lang's generally conceded to be the best English versions of standard stories, his collections are the richest and widest in range. His position as one of England's foremost folklorists as well as his first-rate literary abilities make his collections unmatchable in the English language.",048621799X,9780486217994),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","No, that diminutive but independent vocable, begins its great role early in human life and never loses it. For not only can it head a negative sentence, announcing its judgement, or answer a question, implying its negated content, it can, and mostly does, in the beginning of speech, express an assertion of the resistant will--sometimes just that and nothing more. The adult antiphony to the toddler's incessant no is another no, that of preventive command, and the great commandments of later life continue to be prohibitions: Nine of the Ten Commandments are in the negative. Eva Brann explores nothingness in the third book of her trilogy, which has treated imagination, time and now naysaying. If we want to understand something of imagination, memory and time, she argues, we must mount an inquiry into what it means to say something is not what it claims to be or is not there or is nonexistent or is affected by Nonbeing.",0742512282,9780742512283),Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","Kundera brilliantly examines the work of such important and diverse figures as Rabelais, Cervantes, Sterne, Diderot, Flaubert, Tolstoy, and Musil. He is especially penetrating on Hermann Broch, and his exploration of the world of Kafka's novels vividly reveals the comic terror of Kafka's bureaucratized universe.Kundera's discussion of his own work includes his views on the role of historical events in fiction, the meaning of action, and the creation of character in the post-psychological novel.",0060093749,9780060093747),Paperback,,176 pages,"

","Novalis’ Gedichte sind tiefe und lichte Zeugnisse einer Geisteserotik. Denn an nichts litt dieser Dichter mehr als an der Vorstellung, 'getrennt' zu sein, der Vereinigung entfremdet. Getrennt von der kindlichen, früh verstorbenen Geliebten Sophie von Kühn. Vereinigt mit dem Geist der Verstorbenen. Entfremdet durch kritische Einsicht in die 'wahren Verhältnisse'. Seine 'Hymnen an die Nacht' sind Gesänge an die Nachtbraut. Seine 'inneren Sayten' hatte Novalis in die Nacht gestellt wie die Äolsharfe in den Wind. Und was erklang? Wehmut und Hoffnung auf eine Brautnacht mit der Nachtbraut, die das Ich der 'Hymnen' in der Gestalt eines 'unerschöpflichen Traumes' vollzieht.",9783866470545,9783866470545,Hardcover,,80 pages,"

","Nel corso della vita tutti abbiamo vissuto quel sentimento euforico e doloroso, carico di paura e di felicità, chiamato amore. Ma dove ha origine e come agisce la sua forza misteriosa che sempre attrae e rapisce? Come possiamo viverlo nel modo più vero? E qual è il messaggio che esso porta con sé? Sono le domande fondamentali a cui Vito Mancuso risponde con la profonda intensità che da sempre caratterizza il suo pensiero, accogliendo tra le pagine la dolcezza e la potenza di una straordinaria avventura umana affrontata nelle sue forme più diverse: dall'amore sensuale dei corpi a quello del puro sentimento, dall'amore per la natura e gli animali a quello della mistica e della spiritualità. In questo libro, puro ma mai puritano, si ragiona così senza paura di controversie a proposito di rapporti prematrimoniali, adulterio, masturbazione, omosessualità, bisessualità: rimanendo sempre fedele al primato della coscienza e della libertà individuale ed esponendo tutti i limiti della morale tradizionale cattolica, l'autore propone una prospettiva etica in grado di orientare dal basso un esercizio giusto e insieme libero della sessualità. L'amore diviene così il punto di vista privilegiato per guardare a tutta l'esistenza. Anche se mai come nel nostro tempo infatti il divertimento e lo svago sembrano rappresentare il fine ultimo a cui tendere, in Io amo sono indicate le tracce preziose per raggiungere l'amore vero e purificatore, l'unica esperienza capace di dare un senso autentico al nostro essere al mondo.",Italian,Italian,Hardcover,,160 pages,"

","If you think Babar is the only storybook elephant with a cult following, then you haven’t met Uncle, the presiding pachyderm of a wild fictional universe that has been collecting accolades from children and adults for going on fifty years. Unimaginably rich, invariably swathed in a magnificent purple dressing-gown, Uncle oversees a vast ramshackle castle full of friendly kooks while struggling to fend off the sneak attacks of the incorrigible (and ridiculous) Badfort Crowd. Each Uncle story introduces a new character from Uncle’s madcap world: Signor Guzman, careless keeper of the oil lakes; Noddy Ninety, an elderly train conductor and the oldest student of Dr. Lyre’s Select School for Young Gentlemen; the proprietors of Cheapman’s Store (where motorbikes are a halfpenny each) and Dearman’s Store (where the price of an old milk jug goes up daily); along with many others. But for every delightful friend of Uncle, there is a foe who is no less deliriously wicked. Luckily the misbegotten schemes of the Badfort Crowd are no match for Uncle’s superior wits. Quentin Blake’s quirky illustrations are the perfect complement to J.P. Martin’s stories, each one of a perfect length for bedtime reading. Lovers of Roald Dahl and William Steig will rejoice in Uncle’s wonderfully bizarre and happy world, where the good guys always come out on top, and once a year, everybody, good and bad, sits down together for an enormous Christmas feast.",1590172396,9781590172391),Hardcover,,176 pages,"

But when an innocent game of dodgeball among Percy and his classmates turns into a death match against an ugly gang of cannibal giants, things get... well, ugly. And the unexpected arrival of Percy’s friend Annabeth brings more bad news: the magical borders that protect Camp Half-Blood have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and unless a cure is found, the only safe haven for demigods will be destroyed.In this fresh, funny, and hugely anticipated follow up to The Lightning Thief, Percy and his friends must journey into the Sea of Monsters to save their beloved camp. But first, Percy will discover a stunning new secret about his family—one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon’s son is an honor or simply a cruel joke.Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN13: 9781423103349",English,English,Paperback,,288 pages,"

Sassy “angelic” Grace Evangeline will stop at nothing to see her romance novel produced for Broadway. Devin Bressard knows all about the commercial success of Ms. Evangeline’s “novels”—as far from his literary, nerve-striking plays as anything could be. Grace intends to pull his head out of the rarefied air long enough to make her point, even if it involves stalking him and infiltrating his friends and colleagues. It’s research, after all. Devin knows she’s trouble, but who would guess the spokesperson for strength and virtue would be a calamity vortex? He mounts a fierce resistance, but when he’s forced to work with Grace, his profession and sanity aren’t the only things at risk. Collapsing walls on both sides bring a detente that could shatter their bond—or resound through more lives than their own.",0996750304,9780996750301),ebook,,416 pages,"

There, perhaps, lies the greatest irony of all, that I named myself anew after Estri Hadrath diet Estrazi, who in reality I had once been. And perhaps it is not irony at all, but an expression of Khys' humor, an implicit dissertation by him who structured my experiences, my very thoughts, for nearly two years, until his audacity drove him to bring together once more Sereth crill Tyris, past-Slayer, then the outlawed Ebvrasea, then arrar to the dharen himself; Chayin rendi Inekte, cahndor of Nemar, co-cahndor of the Taken Lands, chosen so of Tar-Kesa, and at that time Khys' puppet-vassal; and myself, former Well-Keepress, tiask of Nemar, and lastly becoming the chaldless outlaw who had come to judgment and endured ongoing retribution at the dharen's hands. To test his hesting, his power over owkahen, the time-coming-to-be, did Khys put us together, all three, in his Day-Keeper's city -- and from that moment onward, the Weathers of Life became fixed: siphoned into a singular future; sealed tight as a dead god in his mausoleum, whose every move brought him closer to the sum total, obliteration. So did the dharen Khys bespeak it, himself. . . .",B01M5HSQX2,B01M5HSQX2,Kindle Edition,,309 pages,"

Le ore di scuola sono uno strazio, i professori “una specie protetta che speri si estingua definitivamente”. Così, quando arriva un nuovo supplente di storia e filosofia, lui si prepara ad accoglierlo con cinismo e palline inzuppate di saliva. Ma questo giovane insegnante è diverso: una luce gli brilla negli occhi quando sprona gli studenti a cercare il proprio sogno. Leo ha un nemico che lo atterrisce: il bianco. Il bianco è l’assenza, tutto ciò che ha a che fare con la privazione e la perdita è bianco. Il rosso invece è il colore dell’amore, della passione, del sangue; rosso è il colore dei capelli di Beatrice. Perché un sogno Leo ce l’ha e si chiama Beatrice, anche se lei ancora non lo sa. Leo ha anche una realtà, Silvia, una presenza affidabile e serena. Quando scopre che Beatrice è ammalata e che la malattia ha qualcosa a che fare con quel bianco che tanto lo spaventa, Leo dovrà scavare a fondo dentro di sé, sanguinare e rinascere, per capire che i sogni non possono morire e trovare il coraggio di credere in qualcosa di più grande.",Polish,Polish,Paperback,,312 pages,"

","Europa, siglo XIV. Mientras España, Francia e Inglaterra ultiman su unificación, los Estados italianos se ven envueltos en conflictos permanentes por culpa de la religión, el poder y el ansia de expansión territorial. Lo único que les une es el renacimiento cultural de las artes. En la Florencia de los Médici, epicentro de este despliegue artístico, una mano anónima acusa de sodomía a un joven y prometedor Leonardo da Vinci. Durante dos meses será interrogado y torturado hasta que la falta de pruebas lo ponga en libertad. Con la reputación dañada, Leonardo partirá hacia nuevos horizontes para demostrar su talento y apaciguar las secuelas psicológicas provocadas en prisión.¿Quién lo acusó? ¿Con qué motivo? Mientras se debate entre evasión o venganza Leonardo descubrirá que no todo es lo que parece cuando se trata de alcanzar el éxito.Haciendo gala de un estilo documental exhaustivo y exquisito, fruto de varios años de investigación y de viajes a los escenarios más representativos de la vida del genio, Christian Gálvez construye un thriller histórico, una novela de aventuras en la que se dan cita arte, venganza y pasión. Una obra que atrapa desde las primeras páginas y que cambiará la opinión que hasta ahora se tiene del genio florentino.",B00ISB69NA,B00ISB69NA,Kindle Edition,,349 pages,"

Climbing into the Winnebago his father left him, they set out across America in search of the sites his father had captured through the lens of his Nikon.As an aspiring photographer, Justin can think of no better way to honor his father’s memory than to scatter his ashes at the sites he held sacred.

Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence — with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin.

","In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize–winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an “unrecognized immigration” within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.",0679763880,9780679763888),Paperback,,622 pages,"

","Popularly known as Rio, or 'the City that never sleeps', Rio de Janeiro, the capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, is vibrant and full of life. It is Brazil's most famous and second largest City after Sao Paulo. Rio is known for many things: it is the third largest Metropolis in the whole of South America, one of the top visited Cities in the world, and every tourist's dream destination. Rio de Janeiro is an unforgettable City. It is littered with plenty of beaches, breathtaking mountains, striking architecture, and lush vegetation. From the famous Ipanema and Copacabana beaches; where playing, swimming, strolling, and sunbathing are just but a few of the day's activities, to the county's and world's largest Art Deco statue; Christ the Redeemer, perched elegantly on Corcovado Mountain, and to the city's unforgettable annual Carnival celebrations marked with extravaganzas of feasting, music, dance, and costumed revelry, you will never want to get out of Rio! And most significant, the people of Rio; Cariocas, are warm, welcoming, and truly lovable. No wonder there is a widespread adage that 'it's easier to gain entry into Rio than to want to exit it'.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,104 pages,"

","Professor Bowen's book is more than a simple collection of musical allusions; it is an engaging discussion of how Joyce uses music to expand and orchestrate his major themes. The introductions to the separate sections, on each of Joyce's works, express a new and cohesive critical theory and reevaluate the major thematic patterns in the works. The introductory material proceeds to analyze the general workings of music in each particular book. The specific musical references follow, accompanied by their sources and an examination of the role each plays in the work.While the author considers the early works with equal care, the bulk of this volume explores the musical resonances of Ulysses, especially as they affect the style, structure, characterization, and themes. Like motifs in Wagnerian opera, some allusions introduce and later remind us of characters--bits of Molly's songs for instance constantly intrude her impending adultery on Bloom's consciousness. Other motifs are linked to concerns such as Stephen's Oedipal guilt over his mother's death, which in turn connects to his preoccupation with Shakespeare, the creator, the father, and the cuckold. Music helps create the bond which briefly joins Stephen and Bloom, and music augments the entire grand theme of consubstantiality.Professor Bowen's style is simple and clear, allowing Joycean artifice to speak for itself.The volume includes a bibliography.",0873952480,9780873952484),Hardcover,,372 pages,"

Mortmain progetta di usare un esercito di automi spietati per distruggere una volta per tutte i Cacciatori. Gli manca un solo elemento per completare l'opera: Tessa Gray. Intanto, Charlotte Branwell, capo dell'Istituto, cerca disperatamente di trovarlo per impedirgli di scatenare l'attacco. E quando Mortmain rapisce Tessa, Will e Jem, i ragazzi che ambiscono alla conquista del suo cuore, fanno di tutto per salvarla. Perché anche se Tessa e Jem sono fidanzati ufficialmente, Will è ancora innamorato di lei, ora più che mai. Tuttavia, mentre chi le vuole bene unisce le forze per strapparla alla perfidia di Mortmain, Tessa si rende conto che l'unica persona in grado di salvarla dal male è lei stessa.

","Set in the changing world of the 1960s, the motion picture Girl Interrupted is the searing story of Susanna, a young woman who finds herself at a mental institution for troubled young women. Susanna's 'short rest', prescribed by a psychiatrist she had met just once, becomes a strange journey into Alice's Wonderland, as she spends nearly a year both struggling and flirting with the thin line between 'normal' and 'crazy'. Susanna soon realizes how hard it is to get out once she's been committed, and ultimately she has to choose between the world of those who belong on the inside - such as the seductive and dangerous Lisa - and those who can engage with the reality of the outside world."" ""This volume includes storyboards and a discussion by the film's director James Mangold about the film-making process by which this screenplay by James Mangold and Lisa Loomer and Anna Hamilton Phelan was transferred to the screen.",057120211X,9780571202119),Paperback,Faber and Faber Screenplays,167 pages,"

","From Wikipedia: Daniel Keyes (born August 9, 1927) is an American author best known for his Hugo award-winning short story and Nebula award-winning novel Flowers for Algernon. Keyes was given the Author Emeritus honor by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2000. ~~~ Flowers for Algernon is a science fiction short story and subsequent novel written by Daniel Keyes. The short story, written in 1958 and first published in the April 1959 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1960.[2] The novel was published in 1966 and was joint winner of that year's Nebula Award for Best Novel (with Babel-17). ~~~ The eponymous Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence by artificial means. The story is told as a series of progress reports written by Charlie, the first human test subject for the surgery, and touches upon many different ethical and moral themes such as the treatment of the mentally disabled. ~~~ Although the book has often been challenged for removal from libraries in the US and Canada, sometimes successfully, it is regularly taught in schools around the world and has been adapted numerous times for television, theatre, radio and as the Academy Award-winning film Charly. ~~~ The ideas for Flowers for Algernon developed over a period of 14 years and were inspired by numerous events in Keyes's life, starting in 1945 with Keyes's personal conflict with his parents who were pushing him through a pre-medical education in spite of his own desire to pursue a writing career. Keyes felt that his education was driving a wedge between him and his parents and this led him to wonder what would happen if it were possible to increase a person's intelligence. Another key moment came in 1957, while Keyes was teaching English to students with special needs; one student asked him if it would be possible to be put into a regular class if he worked hard and became smart.",English,English,Mass Market Paperback,,216 pages,"

","We know you are here, our brothers and sisters . . . Pressia barely remembers the Detonations or much about life during the Before. In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost--how the world went from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash . . . There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked: Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss--maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her. When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.",1455503053,9781455503056),Paperback,,431 pages,"

Moving from the peasant revolts of the late Middle Ages to the witch-hunts and the rise of mechanical philosophy, Federici investigates the capitalist rationalization of social reproduction.

After ten years she’s returning home, a courageous, forthright woman. But while her body’s scars have healed, her spirit remains fragile, fearing the shadows of her past. Sevenwaters is in turmoil. The fey prince Mac Dara is desperate to see his only son, married to Maeve’s sister, return to the Otherworld. To force Lord Sean’s hand, Mac Dara has caused a party of innocent travelers on the Sevenwaters border to vanish—only to allow their murdered bodies to be found one by one. When Maeve finds a body in a remote part of the woods, she and her brother, Finbar, embark on a journey that could bring about the end of Mac Dara’s reign—or lead to a hideous death. If she is successful, Maeve may open the door to a future she has not dared to believe possible....",045146480X,9780451464804),Hardcover,,434 pages,"

","Cass, Nix, and Del are good at two things: finding treasure and killing demons. Lying low is a close third—but not because they want to be good at hiding. They’re FireSouls, some of the unlucky few to inherit a piece of the dragon’s soul. On the surface, the perks are sweet—they have the power to find and steal any type of magical treasure, including the powers of other supernaturals. But it doesn’t come without a price—stealing powers requires that they kill, and others would destroy them if they discover what they are. In a world full of magic, hiding their powers is the only way to survive. That's not too hard, except for the fact that they’re being blackmailed by a criminal overlord who holds their lives in his hands. He wants a pair or rare daggers hidden inside a deadly temple. If Cass, Nix, and Del don’t get him the daggers, they’re dead. But when they get’s into the temple, they realize that things are even worse than they’d imagined. What was supposed to be a normal job is decidedly…not. And surviving it might be impossible.",English,English,ebook,,106 pages,"

Toss in bringing her new beau home for Sunday dinner and trying to explain the hundred pairs of stolen Jimmy Choos in her Uncle Vito's living room...and Teddi Gallo's already-chaotic life is made all the more messy.

","The battle for the World Chess Championship has witnessed numerous titanic struggles that have engaged the interest not only of chess enthusiasts but of the public at large. The chessboard is the ultimate mental battleground and the world champions themselves are supreme intellectual gladiators.This magnificent compilation of chess from the mid-20th century forms the basis of the second part of Garry Kasparov's long-awaited definitive history of the World Chess Championship. Garry Kasparov, who is universally acclaimed as the greatest chess player ever, subjects the play of his early predecessors to a rigorous analysis. This volume features the play of champions Max Euwe (1935-1937) Mikhail Botvinnik (1946-1957, 1958-1961 and 1961-1963), Vassily Smyslov (1957-1958) and Mikhail Tal (1960-1961).However, this book is more than just a compilation of the games of these champions. Kasparov's biographies place them in a fascinating historical, political and cultural context. Kasparov explains how each champion brought his own distinctive style to the chessboard and enriched the theory of the game with new ideas.",185744342X,9781857443424),Hardcover,,480 pages,"

","The definitive cult, post-modern novel – a shocking blend of violence, transgression and eroticism – reissued with a new introduction from Zadie Smith.When Ballard, our narrator, smashes his car into another and watches a man die in front of him, he finds himself drawn with increasing intensity to the mangled impacts of car crashes. Robert Vaughan, a former TV scientist turned nightmare angel of the expressway, has gathered around him a collection of alienated crash victims and experiments with a series of auto-erotic atrocities, each more sinister than the last. But Vaughan craves the ultimate crash – a head-on collision of blood, semen, engine coolant and iconic celebrity.First published in 1973 ‘Crash’ remains one of the most shocking novels of the twentieth century and was made into an equally controversial film by David Cronenberg.This edition is part of a new commemorative series of Ballard’s works, featuring introductions from a number of his admirers (including Robert Macfarlane, Martin Amis, James Lever and Ali Smith) and brand-new cover designs from the artist Stanley Donwood.",000728702X,9780007287024),Paperback,,208 pages,"

","This unforgettable narrative follows the astonishing career and epic manhunt for Whitey Bulger—a gangster whose life was more sensational than fiction.Raised in a South Boston housing project, James ""Whitey"" Bulger became the most wanted fugitive of his generation. In this riveting story, rich with family ties and intrigue, award-winning Boston Globe reporters Kevin Cullen and Shelley Murphy follow Whitey's extraordinary criminal career--from teenage thievery to bank robberies to the building of his underworld empire and a string of brutal murders. It was after a nine-year stint in Alcatraz and other prisons that Whitey reunited with his brother William ""Billy"" Bulger, who was soon to become one of Massachusetts's most powerful politicians. He also became reacquainted with John Connolly, who had grown up around the corner from the Bulgers and was now--with Billy's help--a rising star at the FBI.Once Whitey emerged triumphant from the bloody Boston gang wars, Connolly recruited him as an informant against the Mafia. Their clandestine relationship made Whitey untouchable; the FBI overlooked gambling, drugs, and even homicide to protect their source. Among the close-knit Irish community in South Boston, nothing was more important than honor and loyalty, and nothing was worse than being a rat. Whitey is charged with the deaths of nineteen people killed over turf, for business, and even for being informants; yet to this day he denies he ever gave up his friends or landed anyone in jail.Based on exclusive access and previously undisclosed documents, Cullen and Murphy explore the truth of the Whitey Bulger story. They reveal for the first time the extent of his two parallel family lives with different women, as well as his lifelong paranoia stemming in part from his experience in the CIA's MKULTRA program. They describe his support of the IRA and his hitherto-unknown role in the Boston busing crisis, and they show a keen understanding of his mindset while on the lam and behind bars. The result is the first full portrait of this legendary criminal figure--a gripping story of wiseguys and cops, horrendous government malfeasance, and a sixteen-year manhunt that climaxed in Whitey's dramatic capture in Santa Monica in June 2011.",0393087727,9780393087727),Hardcover,,496 pages,"

There's nothing worse than the last day of holiday. Oh wait, there is. When what should have been a proposal turns into a break, Liv and Adam find themselves on opposite sides of the life they had mapped out. Friends and family all think they're crazy; Liv throws herself into work - animals are so much simpler than humans - and Adam tries to get himself out of the hole he's dug.

","Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt’ten, kahramanı Cun gibi küçücük, esin kaynağı ve temel konusu Zen gibi özlü bir roman“Şişmanlayamayan Sumocu”Fransa’da eserleri “çok satanlar” listelerinde yer alan, roman, öykü ve oyun yazarı Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt yeni kitabı “Şişmanlayamayan Sumocu”da, tinsellikle insanın kendini yeniden inşa edebileceğini, kendini aşabileceğini ve kendine hakim olabileceğini anlatıyor.Yoldan çıkmış bir Japon ergenin öyküsünü anlatan “Şişmanlayamayan Sumocu”, bizi kendimiz hakkında düşünmeye ve “kendimiz olmak için çabaya” davet ediyor. Meditasyon yoluyla kurtuluşu anlatan, naif, yalın, çocuksu bir uzun öykü ya da modern bir masal tarzındaki kitabın felsefesini, “Bulutların arkasında her zaman bir gök vardır” sloganı yansıtıyor. Bir Sumocunun tüm fiziksel görünürlüğüne karşın, görünmeyen ve gelişen iç dünyasını ele alan “Şişmanlayamayan Sumocu”, Schmitt’in dinleri ele aldığı beş romanlık dizisinin sonuncu kitabı.Kitabın kahramanı olan 15 yaşındaki Cun, ailesini ve okulunu terk etmiş, Tokyo sokaklarında işportacılık yaparak geçinen, isyan ve nefret dolu, kavgacı bir Japon gencidir. Japonya’nın en ünlü sumo okullarından birinin başında olan Şomintsu çocuğa musallat olur, çöp gibi zayıf ve sırık gibi uzun olduğu halde, “Sende bir şişman görüyorum!” diyerek onu ısrarla sumoyla tanışmaya teşvik eder. Cun adama gösterdiği tüm dirence rağmen, başına gelen çeşitli talihsizliklerin ve yaşadığı sefaletin de etkisiyle sonunda teslim olur, sumo okuluna gider, çalışmaya başlar. Ama dokuz ay boyunca kendini besiye çekmesine rağmen bir türlü şişmanlayıp form tutamaz. Şomintsu’ya göre bunun nedeni, delikanlının önyargılarının esiri olması, ruhundan kopuk yaşaması, bilincinin duygularını ve ruhunu karartmasıdır. Cun, Zen yoluna girip ruhunu özgürleştirip kendini kabullenmesi halinde esenliğe kavuşacak, “içindeki şişmanı” keşfedecek ve ailesiyle ilgili gerçeği öğrenecektir.",9786050905618,9786050905618,Paperback,1.baskı,64 pages,"

","""Her affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being; it enveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness of her past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist in their attempts to touch her-doubt, fear, moodiness, care, shame. She knew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing light, but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry subjection there."" Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented was a controversial work when it first appeared in the early 1890s. The serialized version of 1891 was heavily censored and the full novel of 1892 received mixed reviews, largely because it challenged the sexual morals of late Victorian England. The book's reputation has since grown considerably and it is now routinely cited as Thomas Hardy's masterpiece. Roman Polanski's 1979 film version (Tess) boosted world-wide interest in the novel and it has remained widely read now for over a century.The richly descriptive narrative is rife with unforgettable vignettes of rural life in late 19th-century England -- the slow death of a flock of wounded pheasants, the monotony of field labor under a gunmetal gray sky, the itinerant farm worker's seasonal round - but the story's timeless power stems from its heart-wrenching romance and the tragic experiences - or fate, as Hardy might have put it - of the eponymous heroine.",1417825839,9781417825837),Hardcover,,592 pages,"

","Darlene Montgomery has been to hell and back…more than once. After a stint in jail for drug possession, she is finally clean and ready to start over. Yet another failed relationship is just the motivation she needs to move from New York to San Francisco with the hopes of resurrecting her dance career and discovering that she is more than the sum of her rap sheet. As Darlene struggles in her new city, the last thing she wants is to become entangled with her handsome—but cranky—neighbor and his adorable little girl...  Sawyer Haas is weeks away from finishing law school, but exhaustion, dwindling finances, and the pressure to provide for himself and his daughter, Olivia, are wearing him down. A federal clerkship--a job he desperately needs--awaits him after graduation, but only if he passes the Bar Exam. Sawyer doesn’t have the time or patience for the capricious—if beautiful—dancer who moves into the apartment above his. But Darlene’s easy laugh and cheerful spirit seep into the cracks of his hardened heart, and slowly break down the walls he’s resurrected to keep from being betrayed ever again.  When the parents of Olivia’s absentee mother come to fight for custody, Sawyer could lose everything. To have any chance at happiness, he must trust Darlene, the woman who has somehow found her way past his brittle barbs, and Darlene must decide how much of her own bruised heart she is willing to give to Sawyer and Olivia, especially when the ghosts of her troubled past refuse to stay buried.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,299 pages,"

","Nove racconti perfetti: la musica del quotidiano, il gioco smorzato dei sentimenti e delle allusioni. Da Flannery O'Connor a Henry James, da Cechov a Tolstoj, non c'è un autore di racconti al quale Alice Munro non sia stata paragonata. Ma la sua capacità di dipanare in un lampo l'irriducibile complessità della natura umana è incomparabile. Questi racconti possiedono la straordinaria capacità di trascinare il lettore nei meandri di una memoria che non è la sua per risvegliare emozioni che sono di tutti. La scrittura della Munro è aperta, lussureggiante, fitta di accadimenti e particolari necessari. Il paesaggio canadese, la natura selvaggia del Nord Ovest partecipano alle emozioni dei personaggi, integrano la loro storia, determinano le loro decisioni.",8806220837,9788806220839),Paperback,Super ET,328 pages,"

","Publicada inicialmente en 1942, La familia de Pascual Duarte marca un hito decisivo en la literatura española y es, después del Quijote, el libro español más traducido a otras lenguas. Pascual Duarte, campesino extremeño hijo de un alcohólico, nos cuenta su vida mientras espera su propia ejecución en la celda de los condenados a muerte. Víctima de una inexorable fatalidad, Pascual Duarte es un ser primitivo y elemental dominado por la violencia, única respuesta que conoce a la traición y al engaño. Pero esa siniestra apariencia no es más que la máscara que oculta su incapacidad para luchar contra la maldad de los demás y la desvalida impotencia que alberga en el fondo de su alma. La familia de Pascual Duarte ha ganado con los años fuerza y dramatismo y su protagonista, que no ha perdido el encanto primigenio, es ya un arquetipo de alcance universal.",072930356X,9780729303569),Paperback,,118 pages,"

","Symmetry is a classic study of symmetry in mathematics, the sciences, nature, and art from one of the twentieth century's greatest mathematicians. Hermann Weyl explores the concept of symmetry beginning with the idea that it represents a harmony of proportions, and gradually departs to examine its more abstract varieties and manifestations--as bilateral, translatory, rotational, ornamental, and crystallographic. Weyl investigates the general abstract mathematical idea underlying all these special forms, using a wealth of illustrations as support. Symmetry is a work of seminal relevance that explores the great variety of applications and importance of symmetry.",0691023743,9780691023748),Paperback,,176 pages,"

No woman cannot deny the pleasure of a man’s love going in and out of her, and no man can compare to the pleasure a woman gives to him through sexual activity. SEX RIGHT NOW! Is a book that brings heat to dormant feelings, and arouses one to find that partner that helps them reach a climax beyond this world. Many books take a reader through stories, long and unnecessary prose to arouse their minds with love, sex and freakiness. However, this book is unlike any other book, because it starts off with a woman sharing her intimate juice with you, while others characters take you through a ride that is guaranteed to make you feel good.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,,"

Then came a final blow no one could have expected: all the world’s corpses rising up to make more.Born into this bleak and bloody landscape, twelve-year-old Julie struggles to hold on to hope as she and her parents drive across the wastelands of America, a nightmarish road trip in search of a new home.Hungry, lost, and scared, sixteen-year-old Nora finds herself her brother’s sole guardian after her parents abandon them in the not-quite-empty ruins of Seattle.And in the darkness of a forest, a dead man opens his eyes. Who is he? What is he? With no clues beyond a red tie and the letter “R,” he must unravel the grim mystery of his existence—right after he learns how to think, how to walk, and how to satisfy the monster howling in his belly. The New Hunger is a glimpse of the past and a path to an astonishing future…",1476799652,9781476799650),Paperback,,170 pages,"

","“Never underestimate the power of a good story.”Good advice...especially when a story can kill you.For most people, the story of their lives is just that: the accumulation of time, encounters, and actions into a cohesive whole. But for an unfortunate few, that day-to-day existence is affected—perhaps infected is a better word—by memetic incursion: where fairy tale narratives become reality, often with disastrous results.That's where the ATI Management Bureau steps in, an organization tasked with protecting the world from fairy tales, even while most of their agents are struggling to keep their own fantastic archetypes from taking over their lives. When you're dealing with storybook narratives in the real world, it doesn't matter if you're Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, or the Wicked Queen: no one gets a happily ever after.Indexing is New York Times bestselling author Seanan McGuire’s new urban fantasy where everything you thought you knew about fairy tales gets turned on its head.",English,English,Paperback,,404 pages,"

A contatto con il microcosmo del sanatorio, vero e proprio panorama di tutte le correnti di pensiero, il suo carattere subisce un'evoluzione e un incremento: passa attraverso la malattia, l'amore (la signora Chauchat), il razionalismo e la gioia di vivere (Settembrini), il pessimismo irrazionale (Naphta), senza che nessuna di queste posizioni lo converta. Ma in mezzo a tante forze contrastanti, Castorp trova il suo equilibrio. Scoppia la guerra nel 1914 e Hans viene strappato da questa magica e raffinata atmosfera per essere gettato sui campi di battaglia dove la sua sorte resta incerta, ma immersa in un clima di morte.",8879720007,9788879720007),Paperback,Scrittori di Tutto il Mondo,692 pages,"

","City girl Tess Roger's idea of adventure involves putting cream instead of milk in her coffee, so she has no business consulting on a new adventure park. But when her best friend makes her a deal she can’t refuse, posing as a consultant is exactly what she does. Surely she should be able to fake her way through a meeting or two. How hard could it be?Max Grant isn’t blind. It’s easy to see that the super sexy, consultant put on his account doesn’t know a thing about adventure activities. He can see after only five minutes of meeting her in Hope Falls that she isn’t who she says she is. But there’s something about her and when the chance to take her back to Castle Mountain Lodge comes up, he can’t resist the opportunity.Lies have a way of building, and with her feelings for Max growing, Tess can’t keep it up for much longer.

","Set adrift by his wife's suicide and struggling to keep a grip on reality, Bunny Munro does the only thing he can think of: with his young son in tow, he hits the road. To his son, waiting patiently in the car while his father peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself, haunted by what might be his wife's ghost, seems only dimly aware of his son's existence.When his bizarre trip shades into a final reckoning, when he can no longer be sure what is real and what is not, Bunny finally begins to recognize the love he feels for his son. And he sees that the revenants of his world—decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands, and horned psycho-killers—are lurking in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll.At turns dark and humane, The Death of Bunny Munro is a tender portrait of the relationship between a boy and his father, with all the wit and enigma that fans will recognize as Nick Cave's singular vision.",0865479402,9780865479401),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Nathaniel is a boy magician-in-training, sold to the government by his birth parents at the age of five and sent to live as an apprentice to a master. Powerful magicians rule Britain, and its empire, and Nathaniel is told his is the ""ultimate sacrifice"" for a ""noble destiny."" If leaving his parents and erasing his past life isn't tough enough, Nathaniel's master, Arthur Underwood, is a cold, condescending, and cruel middle-ranking magician in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The boy's only saving grace is the master's wife, Martha Underwood, who shows him genuine affection that he rewards with fierce devotion. Nathaniel gets along tolerably well over the years in the Underwood household until the summer before his eleventh birthday. Everything changes when he is publicly humiliated by the ruthless magician Simon Lovelace and betrayed by his cowardly master who does not defend him.Nathaniel vows revenge. In a Faustian fever, he devours magical texts and hones his magic skills, all the while trying to appear subservient to his master. When he musters the strength to summon the 5,000-year-old djinni Bartimaeus to avenge Lovelace by stealing the powerful Amulet of Samarkand, the boy magician plunges into a situation more dangerous and deadly than anything he could ever imagine.",0552550299,9780552550291),Paperback,New edition,480 pages,"

","When published in hardcover in 1997, this book was praised for providing an engrossing education not only in naval strategy and tactics but in Victorian social attitudes and the influence of character on history. In juxtaposing an operational with a cultural theme, the author comes closer than any historian yet to explaining what was behind the often described operations of this famous 1916 battle at Jutland. Although the British fleet was victorious over the Germans, the cost in ships and men was high, and debates have raged within British naval circles ever since about why the Royal Navy was unable to take advantage of the situation. In this book Andrew Gordon focuses on what he calls a fault-line between two incompatible styles of tactical leadership within the Royal Navy and different understandings of the rules of the games.",1557509719,9781557509710),Paperback,,708 pages,"

","È possibile assomigliare a una delle più grandi icone dello stile, indipendente, bella, desiderata ed elegante come Coco Chanel? Rebecca ha trentatré anni, più di cento paia di scarpe, un armadio pieno di tubini neri, completi di tweed e una smisurata passione per la magnifica Coco. È romantica, sognatrice, e follemente innamorata di Niccolò, che sta per raggiungere a Milano, dopo un anno di relazione a distanza. Un nuovo lavoro come wedding planner, una vita vicino all'uomo che ama: la felicità sembra a portata di mano. Ma una brutta sorpresa è in agguato: appena giunta nella metropoli, Niccolò le confessa di essersi innamorato di un'altra. Rebecca si ritrova così in una città che non conosce e con il cuore a pezzi. Ma il suo mito, la grande Coco, come avrebbe reagito? Indossando degli enormi occhiali scuri, alzando la testa in segno di sfida, non avrebbe mai permesso a un uomo di schiacciare il suo spirito ribelle e anticonvenzionale! ""Per essere insostituibili bisogna essere unici"", e forse Niccolò, unico non lo era. Dopo intere giornate chiusa a casa, Rebecca è pronta a voltare pagina: si tuffa nell'intensa vita mondana milanese e, con lo stile della sua eroina, assapora la sensazione di sentirsi una donna cercata e desiderata. Resterà un'eterna mademoiselle, come l'intramontabile Coco?

Her bold presence draws three very different suitors: the gentleman-farmer Boldwood, soldier-seducer Sergeant Troy and the devoted shepherd Gabriel Oak. Each, in contrasting ways, unsettles her decisions and complicates her life, and tragedy ensues, threatening the stability of the whole community.

","My name is Rex. I am a good dog. Rex is also seven foot tall at the shoulder, bulletproof, bristling with heavy calibre weaponry and his voice resonates with subsonics especially designed to instil fear. With Dragon, Honey and Bees, he's part of a Multiform Assault Pack operating in the lawless anarchy of Campeche, south-eastern Mexico. Rex is a genetically engineered Bioform, a deadly weapon in a dirty war. He has the intelligence to carry out his orders and feedback implants to reward him when he does. All he wants to be is a Good Dog. And to do that he must do exactly what Master says and Master says he's got to kill a lot of enemies. But who, exactly, are the enemies? What happens when Master is tried as a war criminal? What rights does the Geneva Convention grant weapons? Do Rex and his fellow Bioforms even have a right to exist? And what happens when Rex slips his leash? ",B06XXJ4P9H,B06XXJ4P9H,Kindle Edition,,262 pages,"

","Kim could tell at a glance Angel wasn’t the average attractive yet poorly disguised extraterrestrial scout sent to assess Earth’s defenses before the inevitable alien invasion. Angel’s memory loss cover story? Lame. Robbing a passing ruffian of his shirt to cover her naked body? NOT a good way to avoid attracting attention! As a science fiction geek, Kim felt herself uniquely qualified to watch Angel and thwart her dark mission…once the alien got around to it. But Angel had her own questions. She couldn’t help but wonder, why would Kim invite a stranger home? Surely, it could only be for romance! Kim didn’t dare correct her, not without giving herself away, and so both found themselves in an escalating romantic relationship neither actually wanted. Is it possible lies and deception could lead to true love? Could projected feelings designed to fool the other become genuine? “A Date with Angel is a romantic escalation comedy full of misinterpretations, grand theories, and devious, romantic traps ... and a suspected alien woman doing her best to meet a sci-fi paranoiac's expectations.""",English,English,Kindle Edition,,380 pages,"

","Jesmyn Ward’s first novel since her National Book Award–winning Salvage the Bones, this singular American writer brings the archetypal road novel into rural twenty-first-century America. An intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle, Sing, Unburied, Sing journeys through Mississippi’s past and present, examining the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power—and limitations—of family bonds. Jojo is thirteen years old and trying to understand what it means to be a man. He doesn’t lack in fathers to study, chief among them his Black grandfather, Pop. But there are other men who complicate his understanding: his absent White father, Michael, who is being released from prison; his absent White grandfather, Big Joseph, who won’t acknowledge his existence; and the memories of his dead uncle, Given, who died as a teenager. His mother, Leonie, is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister’s lives. She is an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her. She is Black and her children’s father is White. She wants to be a better mother but can’t put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she’s high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances. When the children’s father is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to the heart of Mississippi and Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. At Parchman, there is another thirteen-year-old boy, the ghost of a dead inmate who carries all of the ugly history of the South with him in his wandering. He too has something to teach Jojo about fathers and sons, about legacies, about violence, about love.",1501126067,9781501126062),Hardcover,,285 pages,"

","Through her incomparable work on screen, stage, record, radio, and television, Judy Garland earned renown as “The World’s Greatest Entertainer.” It was as a motion picture star though, that she first rose to international fame. From her feature film debut in 1936 through the aptly titled I Could Go on Singing in 1963, she lit up the screen with a magic uniquely hers—and dazzled world-wide audiences of all ages. Judy Garland starred in two dozen of the all-time classic movie musicals, among them A Star is Born, Meet Me in St. Louis, Babes in Arms, Easter Parade, For Me and My Gal, and The Harvey Girls. Her dramatic turns in Judgment at Nuremberg, The Clock, and A Child is Waiting won added acclaim. And perhaps most unforgettably, she starred as Dorothy Gale in the best-loved motion picture of all time: The Wizard of Oz. Judy: A Legendary Film Career tells the story of Garland’s movie work in unprecedented detail. Hundreds of never-before-published photos, newly-assembled contemporary reviews, insight from her costars and coworkers, and production histories are provided for each film in which she appeared. Highlighting and complimenting the feature films is a definitive biography; an examination of Judy’s short subjects; details of the movies she did not complete; and an enthralling compendium of film projects for which she was considered or rumored. The text is illustrated by more than five hundred photos, encompassing poster art; costume tests; behind-the-scenes candids; onstage and backstage glimpses of her theatrical successes; and personal snapshots. Judy is the exhaustively researched work of historian John Fricke. He celebrates as never before the heart, humor, and incandescent motion picture achievement of the one-and-only Judy Garland.",English,English,Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East of Eden ""the first book,"" and indeed it has the primordial power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. The masterpiece of Steinbeck’s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence.This edition features an introduction by David Wyatt.",B001BC5HXG,B001BC5HXG,Kindle Edition,,620 pages,"

Until now.The countdown to the next stage of human evolution is about to begin, and humanity may not survive this time.————————————The Immari are good at keeping secrets. For 2,000 years, they have hidden the truth about human evolution. And they’ve searched for an ancient enemy — a threat that could wipe out the human race. Now the search is over.Off the coast of Antarctica, a research vessel has discovered a mysterious structure buried deep in an iceberg. It’s been there for thousands of years, and it isn’t man made. The Immari think they know what it is, but they aren’t taking any chances. The time has come to execute their master plan: humanity must evolve or perish. In a lab in Indonesia, a brilliant geneticist may have just discovered the key to their plan.Four years ago, Dr. Kate Warner left California for Jakarta, Indonesia to escape her past. She hasn’t recovered from what happened to her, but she has made an incredible discovery: a cure for autism. Or so she thinks. What she’s found is actually far more dangerous. Her research could rewrite human history and unleash the next stage of human evolution. In the hands of the Immari, it would mean the end of humanity as we know it.One man has seen pieces of the Immari conspiracy: Agent David Vale. But he’s out of time to stop it. His informant is dead. His organization has been infiltrated. His enemy is hunting him.

","Two brown girls dream of being dancers—but only one, Tracey, has talent. The other has ideas: about rhythm and time, about black bodies and black music, about what constitutes a tribe, or makes a person truly free. It's a close but complicated childhood friendship that ends abruptly in their early twenties, never to be revisited, but never quite forgotten, either.Dazzlingly energetic and deeply human, Swing Time is a story about friendship and music and stubborn roots, about how we are shaped by these things and how we can survive them. Moving from northwest London to West Africa, it is an exuberant dance to the music of time.",0241144159,9780241144152),Hardcover,,453 pages,"

","A fast-paced, breezy read about life at the bottom of the Hollywood food chainNo political science degree could ever prepare Elizabeth Miller for her new job as a second assistant at The Agency, whose clients include everyone you’ve never met—but you know who they’re sleeping with. A former congressional intern in Washington, Lizzie made a bid for a life change that landed her a job a world away, where ethics and First Amendment debates take a backseat to pleading the Fifth for Ritalin-snorting boss Scott Wagner. He’s the hottest young agent in Hollywood, who devotes his days to playing online poker—that is, when he’s not closing a $30 million deal for one of his AAA-list clients. And while getting six-hundred-dollar highlights from Cameron’s colorist or organizing the strippers for George’s birthday party come close to causing heart failure for this East Coast girl, the real dangers lurk elsewhere. But Lizzie is a  survivor, and no Machiavellian assistant, lecherous producer, or power struggle at The Agency can douse her nascent dreams of climbing up the Hollywood ladder. But first she has to run down to the Coffee Bean to pick up that triple espresso, or Scott is going to throw something....",0452286107,9780452286108),Paperback,,357 pages,"

","Dinesh D'Souza rose to national prominence as one of the founders of the Dartmouth Review, a leading voice in the rebirth of conservative politics on college campuses in the 1980s.He fired the first popular shot against political correctness with his best-selling exposé Illiberal Education. Now, after serving as a Reagan White House staffer, the managing editor of Policy Review, and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, he addresses the next generation in Letters to a Young Conservative. Drawing on his own colorful experiences, both within the conservative world and while skirmishing with the left, D'Souza aims to enlighten and inspire young conservatives and give them weapons for the intellectual battles that they face in high school, college, and everyday life. Letters to a Young Conservative also illuminates the enduring themes that for D'Souza anchor the conservative position: not ""family values"" or patriotism, but a philosophy based on natural rights and a belief in universal moral truths.With a light touch, D'Souza shows that conservatism needn't be stodgy or defensive, even though it is based on preserving the status quo. To the contrary, when a conservative has to expose basic liberal assumptions to scrutiny, he or she must become a kind of imaginative, fun-loving, forward-looking guerrilla--philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical.Among the topics Dinesh D'Souza covers in Letters to a Young Conservative: Fighting Political CorrectnessAuthentic vs. Bogus MulticulturalismWhy Government Is the ProblemWhen the Rich Get RicherHow Affirmative Action Hurts BlacksThe Feminist MistakeAll the News That FitsHow to Harpoon a LiberalThe Self-Esteem HoaxA Republican Realignment?Why Conservatives Should Be Cheerful",0465017347,9780465017348),Paperback,,240 pages,"

These tasks should keep Aubrey occupied - but that would be underestimating Aubrey's sense of curiosity and uncanny knack of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Rainier marries and embarks on a life of relative success, but he still can’t recall his time on the battlefield—until the first bombs of the Second World War begin to fall. Suddenly, his memories flood back. Now, recollections of a violent battlefield, a German prison, and a passionate affair all threaten to fracture the peaceful life he has worked so hard to create.

By intimately following the lives of nearly 300 inner-city workers and job seekers for two yearsin Harlem, Newman explores a side of poverty often ignored by media and politicians--the working poor.The working poor find dignity in earning a paycheck and shunning the welfare system, arguing that even low-paying jobs give order to their lives.

Always resourceful, she flourishes as a merchant and is able to support her household. But the local businessmen aren't pleased about competing with a woman and her foes are multiplying around her, desperate to put her back in what they believe is her rightful place.  Anne has a secret that her enemies could use to destroy her. Her beloved son is the product of a passionate affair with the king, Edward IV, who knows nothing of his existence. If this information were to fall into the wrong hands, it could prove lethal for Anne and her child.

Silver-tongued Viscount Sanburne is London's favorite scapegrace. Alas, Lydia Boyce has no interest in being charmed. When his latest escapade exposes a plot to ruin her family, she vows to handle it herself, as she always has done. Certainly she requires no help from a too-handsome dilettante whose main achievement is being scandalous. But Sanburne's golden charisma masks a sharper mind and darker history than she realizes. He shocks Lydia by breaking past her prim facade to the woman beneath...and the hidden fire no man has ever recognized. But as she follows him into a world of intrigue, she will learn that the greatest danger lies within—in the shadowy, secret motives of his heart.",1416592636,9781416592631),Mass Market Paperback,,346 pages,"

","Parmenides, a lecture course delivered by Martin Heidegger at the University of Freiburg in 1942-1943, presents a highly original interpretation of ancient Greek philosophy. A major contribution to Heidegger's provocative dialogue with the pre-Socratics, the book attacks some of the most firmly established conceptions of Greek thinking and of the Greek world. The central theme is the question of truth and the primordial understanding of truth to be found in Parmenides' ""didactic poem."" Heidegger highlights the contrast between Greek and Roman thought and the reflection of that contrast in language. He analyzes the decline in the primordial understanding of truth--and, just as importantly, of untruth--that began in later Greek philosophy and that continues, by virtue of the Latinization of the West, down to the present day. Beyond an interpretation of Greek philosophy, Parmenides (volume 54 of Heidegger's Collected Works) offers a strident critique of the contemporary world, delivered during a time that Heidegger described as ""out of joint.""",0253212146,9780253212146),Paperback,,192 pages,"

Now, Elizabeth has sent her a plane ticket and reserved a room for her at San Francisco's most luxurious hotel. Yet she has not tried to contact Martha since she arrived, leaving her lonely, confused and a little bit worried.

Long Monet had known that even her marriage would serve her people. Her husband would be chosen for her—for this was the way of royal existence. Still, as any woman does—peasant or princess—Monet dreamt of owning true love—of owning choice in love. Thus, each time the raven-haired, sapphire-eyed, Crimson Knight of Karvana rode near, Monet knew regret—for in secret, she loved him—and she could not choose him. As an arrogant king from another kingdom began to wage war against Karvana, Karvana's king, knights and soldiers answered the challenge. The Princess Monet would also know battle. As the Crimson Knight battled with armor and blade—so the Scarlet Princess would battle in sacrifice and with secrets held. Thus, when the charge was given to preserve the heart of Karvana, Monet endeavored to serve her kingdom and forget her secreted love.

He has never granted a writer access to his inner life – until now. Based on six years of interviews with more than three hundred of Young’s associates, and on more than fifty hours of interviews with Young himself, Shakey is a fascinating, prodigious account of the singer’s life and career. Jimmy McDonough follows Young from his childhood in Canada to his cofounding of Buffalo Springfield to the huge success of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to his comeback in the nineties.

Of... is er iets anders...'Louis Couperus schreef de vier delen van De boeken der kleine zielen van 1901 tot 1903. Deze romancyclus speelt zich af in het decadente Haagse milieu dat de schrijver kende als geen ander. Op ontroerende wijze beschrijft Couperus de onvermijdelijke en tragische neergang van de Haags-Indische familie Van Lowe. De dialogen zijn van een sprankelende levendigheid die voor zijn tijd volstrekt uniek was. Zelf omschrijft Couperus dit omvangrijke werk als 'genre Eline Vere, maar rijper; in côterieën half Indisch, half Hollandsch, een meer werkelijke maatschappij, dan die van Eline.'De boeken der kleine zielen wordt algemeen beschouwd als een van de hoogtepunten in Couperus' werk.",Dutch,Dutch,Hardcover,,588 pages,"

","Rachel Jones wasn't looking for trouble, much less a man, but in Kell Sabin she found both. On a hot summer's night Kell is washed up - barely alive - on a Florida beach and into Rachel's life. Her instincts tell her to help him, and their love blossoms as he recovers from his injuries. But by falling in love with Kell, Rachel has put her own life in danger from the forces that want him dead. Once fate has brought them together, can they learn to live apart?",1551663074,9781551663074),Paperback,,247 pages,"

","Modern society is plagued by fragmentation. The various sectors of our communities--businesses, schools, social service organizations, churches, government--do not work together. They exist in their own worlds. As do so many individual citizens, who long for connection but end up marginalized, their gifts overlooked, their potential contributions lost. This disconnection and detachment makes it hard if not impossible to envision a common future and work towards it together. We know what healthy communities look like--there are many success stories out there, and they've been described in detail. What Block provides in this inspiring new book is an exploration of the exact way community can emerge from fragmentation: How is community built? How does the transformation occur? What fundamental shifts are involved? He explores a way of thinking about our places that creates an opening for authentic communities to exist and details what each of us can do to make that happen.",1576754871,9781576754870),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

","If Gabriel García Márquez had chosen to write about Pakistani immigrants in England, he might have produced a novel as beautiful and devastating as Maps for Lost Lovers. Jugnu and Chanda have disappeared. Like thousands of people all over England, they were lovers and living together out of wedlock. To Chanda’s family, however, the disgrace was unforgivable. Perhaps enough so as to warrant murder.As he explores the disappearance and its aftermath through the eyes of Jugnu’s worldly older brother, Shamas, and his devout wife, Kaukab, Nadeem Aslam creates a closely observed and affecting portrait of people whose traditions threaten to bury them alive. The result is a tour de force, intimate, affecting, tragic and suspenseful.",1400076978,9781400076970),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","All About Love offers radical new ways to think about love by showing its interconnectedness in our private and public lives. In eleven concise chapters, hooks explains how our everyday notions of what it means to give and receive love often fail us, and how these ideals are established in early childhood. She offers a rethinking of self-love (without narcissism) that will bring peace and compassion to our personal and professional lives, and asserts the place of love to end struggles between individuals, in communities, and among societies. Moving from the cultural to the intimate, hooks notes the ties between love and loss and challenges the prevailing notion that romantic love is the most important love of all.Visionary and original, hooks shows how love heals the wounds we bear as individuals and as a nation, for it is the cornerstone of compassion and forgiveness and holds the power to overcome shame.For readers who have found ongoing delight and wisdom in bell hooks's life and work, and for those who are just now discovering her, All About Love is essential reading and a brilliant book that will change how we think about love, our culture-and one another.",English,English,Hardcover,,240 pages,"

But even hastily erected barbed wire cannot prevent Uncle Sam from claiming this draftee, and soon Will is on a bus to Fort Thompson, Georgia. In the barracks, our hapless hero meets little Ben Whitledge, a fellow trainee who thinks he deserves a medal simply because his grandfather fought under Stonewall Jackson. This odd duo is assigned to the elite air force, though they would rather serve in that most glorious and revered branch of the army - the infantry. Sergeant King, Will's nemesis, is determined to dampen the young soldier's enthusiasm, but Will - even in his long stint as latrine orderly - consistently prevails and unknowingly confounds the gruff sergeant at every turn.",English,English,Paperback,,214 pages,"

","Here's a thoughtful, probing exploration of why Christians get stuck in the place of complacency, dryness, and tedium -- and how to move on to new levels of spiritual passion! Buchanan shows how the majority of Christians begin their spiritual journey with excitement and enthusiasm -- only to get bogged down in a ""borderland"" -- an in-between space beyond the ""old life"" but short of the abundant, adventurous existence promised by Jesus. Citing Jonah, he examines the problem of ""borderland living"" -- where doubt, disappointment, guilt, and wonderlessness keep people in a quagmire of mediocrity -- then offers solutions ... effective ways to get unstuck and move into a bold, unpredictable, exhilarating walk with Christ.

The Barnes & Noble Review
 January 2000 Since the publication of his first novel, By the Rivers of Babylon, in 1978, Nelson DeMille has produced a steady stream of intelligent, hard-edged, contemporary thrillers, the best of which  such as Cathedral, The Gold Coast, or Word of Honor  are absolute models of the form. It's a pleasure to be able to report that The Lion's Game, DeMille's tenth novel is as shrewdly constructed and compulsively readable as anything he has published to date. Weighing in at nearly 700 pages, The Lion's Game is the longest, most ambitious novel of DeMille's career. It is also his first attempt at a sequel, bringing us a new installment in the colorful career of John Corey, the acerbic narrator/hero of 1997's Plum Island. When last seen, Corey had interrupted his convalescent leave from the NYPD long enough to solve a bizarre double murder on Long Island's Eastern Shore, after which, he formally separated from the police department and became an adjunct professor at John Jay University. Not unexpectedly, Corey grew bored with the uneventful world of academia and decided to return, in a very different capacity, to the front lines of law enforcement. Admirers of Plum Island will be pleased to learn that he is as ornery, insubordinate, and politically incorrect as ever.  The novel opens on April 15th. Corey has just signed on with the Middle Eastern division of the ATTF (Anti-Terrorist Task Force), an organization staffed by an uneasy combination of FBI, CIA, and NYPD operatives. Corey's firstassignmenttakes him to JFK Airport, where, together with an assortment of teammates, he is scheduled to take custody of a defecting Libyan terrorist. The terrorist in question is Asad Khalil, a.k.a. the Lion, the man believed to be responsible for a series of attacks on Americans living in Europe. As Corey and company await the arrival of Khalil and his escorts, it quickly becomes apparent that something has gone seriously wrong.  To begin with, the plane, for unknown reasons, drops out of radio contact hours before its arrival in New York. Eventually, ignoring all commands from Air Traffic Control personnel, the flight lands at JFK in an odd, erratic fashion, taxis to a stop, and proceeds to sit, silent and motionless, on the runway. Unable to establish communication, airport authorities force their way onboard, only to find that a tragedy of unprecedented proportions has occurred and that Asad Khalil, the man responsible for that tragedy, is nowhere to be found, having slipped through the crowd of investigators and made his escape.  The bulk of the novel concerns the protracted hunt for an implacable killer with a very personal mission. It would spoil a number of DeMille's expertly constructed effects to reveal too much of what happens as The Lion's Game unfolds. But here, briefly, is the fundamental premise that dominates this book.  April 15th, the day Khalil's plane arrives at JFK, is not simply income tax day. It is also the anniversary of the 1986 bombing of Libya, a mission ordered by Ronald Reagan in direct response to a series of atrocities reputedly set in motion by Libyan president Moammar Gadhafi. Asad Khalil, who was 16-years-old when the bombing occurred, lost his entire family that day and developed an undying hatred for all things American. Acting both on his own behalf and on behalf of the Great Leader Gadhafi, he has made his way to America, where he is determined to wage a holy war against the murderers of his family.  As Khalil's history, intentions, and specific agenda gradually become clear, Corey leads a diverse group of experts in an increasingly desperate attempt to anticipate the Lion's movements and prevent him from implementing his bloody, ironic endgame. As the lengthy narrative unrolls, The Lion's Game moves backward in time from the present day to the night of the fateful bombing in 1986; the action shifts from New York City to Florida and from Florida to the Pacific Coast, as DeMille skillfully switches back and forth from the first-person viewpoint of John Corey to a third-person narrative that takes us into the deranged perspective of Asad Khalil. The result is a big, wide-ranging novel that is alternately funny and frightening; one that achieves an astonishing, almost effortless narrative momentum; one that is grounded in DeMille's tragic view of the endlessly replicated blood feuds that dominate the landscape of 20th-century geopolitics.  From its eerie opening sequence to its deliberately open-ended conclusion, THE LION'S GAME is the clear product of a world-class storyteller, a man who seems incapable of turning out a bland or boring paragraph. DeMille is at the top of his own game in this one and has written a novel that will inevitably command a large, enthusiastic audience. I, for one, am glad to see it. In a field too often populated by formulaic, by-the-numbers fiction, Nelson DeMille is an undisguised blessing. I wish him health, success, and undiminished productivity in the decades to come.

","Job and Jemima Hardy weren't Londoners by birth. They had both lived in a Sussex village until lack of work had sent Job and the family to Walworth - to a house in Stead Street. They got it cheap because of the poltergiest but they were sensible folk and decided that eight shillings a week rent was a bargain and - well - if the floors and doors sometimes moved a bit, they could live with it. They settled quickly into London life - particularly Jonathan, the eldest. Jonathan got a job at Camberwell Green and it was there, in Lyons teashop, that he met Emma Somers, niece of Boots Adams. Over a long and hazy summer - the summer of 1939 - the two young people met, always at lunchtime, and never allowing their friendship to progress too far.Then, as the clouds of war gathered over Europe, Jonathan got his call-up papers. And the first alarms of conflict began to affect the Adams family in other ways. Boots, on the Officer's Reserve list, was called onto the staff of General Sir Henry Sims, and Polly Sims herself joined the Auxiliaries. Suddenly there was only a little time left for people to lead ordinary lives - and Jonathan Hardy and Emma Somers had to make decisions about their future.",0552145130,9780552145138),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","Many consider the Battle of Midway to have turned the tide of the Pacific War. It is without question one of the most famous battles in history. Now, for the first time since Gordon W. Prange’s bestselling Miracle at Midway, Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully offer a new interpretation of this great naval engagement. Unlike previous accounts, Shattered Sword makes extensive use of Japanese primary sources. It also corrects the many errors of Mitsuo Fuchida’s Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan, an uncritical reliance upon which has tainted every previous Western account. It thus forces a major, potentially controversial reevaluation of the great battle. Parshall and Tully examine the battle in detail and effortlessly place it within the context of the Imperial Navy’s doctrine and technology. With a foreword by leading World War II naval historian John Lundstrom, Shattered Sword is an indispensable part of any military buff’s library.Shattered Sword is the winner of the 2005 John Lyman Book Award for the ""Best Book in U.S. Naval History"" and was cited by Proceedings as one of its ""Notable Naval Books"" for 2005.",1574889230,9781574889239),Hardcover,,612 pages,"

","Best known for the wild, phantasmagoric satire of works like Naked Lunch, William S. Burroughs reveals another, gentler side in The Cat Inside. Originally published as a limited-edition volume, this moving and witty discourse on cats combines deadpan routines and dream passages with a heartwarming account of Burroughs's unexpected friendships with the many cats he has known. It is also a meditation on the long, mysterious relationship between cats and their human hosts, which Burroughs traces back to the Egyptian cult of the ""animal other."" With its street sense and whiplash prose, The Cat Inside is a genuine revelation for Burroughs fans and cat lovers alike.",0142000256,9780142000250),Paperback,,112 pages,"

","Aghora: At the Left Hand of God is the first book in the Aghora trilogy. Written almost entirely in Vimalananda's own words, it presents events from his life, tenets of his philosophy, and highlights from his spiritual practices. Designed partly to shock and partly to comfort, but wholly as an offering to his Beloved, Aghora is as clear a picture as possible of a man who was a riddle wrapped up in an enigma. Vimalananda insisted that this book be published only after his demise, that he might be spared pursuit by those whose curiosity might be inflamed by some of the sensational events described within. He believed in devoting his all to the pursuit of the direct perception of Reality, and advised others to be similarly dedicated to attaining personal experience of God. To readers he offered this warning: ""Don't take anything I say as gospel truth. I am human, I make mistakes. Test on yourselves what I've told you. Try it out, experience it, and then you will know whether or not I'm telling you the truth.""",0914732218,9780914732211),Hardcover,,328 pages,"

","Op het Domplein in Würzburg wachten honderden mensen opgewonden op de heks die zometeen op de brandstapel zal worden gezet. Ook de dertienjarige Nina kijkt toe. Ze rilt. Niet alleen van de kou; het hele tafereel vervult haar met afschuw en tegelijkertijd wordt ze ernaartoe getrokken als door een magneet. Het is 1630 en de heksenjacht is in volle gang. Oude vrouwen, zelfs hele gezinnen niet kleine kinderen worden het slachtoffer. Ook over Nina doen verhalen de ronde. Soms weet ze namelijk zomaar dingen over mensen of heeft ze visionen. Terwijl de geruchten over Nina steeds sterker en grimmiger worden komt ze erachter dat haar moeder als heks verbrand is toen Nina nog heel klein was. Nina's enige aandenken aan haar is een amulet. Om te voorkomen dat ook Nina het slachtoffer wordt van de nietsontziende heksenvervolging, smokkelt Nina's tante haar de stad uit. Ze wil Nina uithuwelijken aan een oude boer. Maar Nina voelt daar niets voor en neemt de benen. Dit is het begin van een lange zwerftocht.",9060699556,9789060699553),Hardcover,,188 pages,"

","Liviu Rebreanu mărturisea la un moment dat că în lunga perioadă de şapte ani, cât a durat scrierea romanului „Ion“, un rol important l-a avut, pe lânga amplul material documentar, o scenă văzută pe colinele dimprejurul satului şi care l-a impresionat în mod deosebit. Aflat la vânătoare, scriitorul a observat ... un ţăran îmbrăcat în haine de sărbătoare, care s-a aplecat deodată şi-a sărutat pământul. L-a sărutat ca pe-o ibovnică. Scena m-a uimit şi s-a întipărit în minte, dar fără vreun scop deosebit, ci numai ca o simplă ciudăţenie.„Ion“ este o monografie a realităţilor satului ardelean de la începutul secolului al XX-lea, ilustrând conflictul generat de lupta pentru pământ, într-o lume în care statutul social este stabilit în funcţie de avere. În acest context, calea aleasă de protagonist pentru a scăpa de sărăcie este căsătoria cu o fată bogată, Ana. Florica, femeia pe care o iubeşte de fapt, se va căsători, la rândul ei, cu George pentru pentru aceleaşi argumente, iar Laura, fiica învăţătorului Herdelea îl va lua pe Pintea nu din dragoste, ci pentru că nu cere zestre.Marele merit al lui Rebreanu este acela că îşi lasă personajele să acţioneze liber, să-şi dezvăluie firea, să izbucnească în tensiuni dramatice, într-un cuvânt, să-şi aleagă singuri destinul.",0720646502,9780720646504),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","Husband and wife Stan and Charmaine are among thousands who have signed up for a new social order because the old one is all but broken. Outside the walls of Consilience, half the country is out of work, gangs of the drug-addicted and disaffected menace the streets, warlords disrupt the food supply, and overcrowded correctional facilities churn out offenders to make room for more.The Consilience prison, Positron, is something else altogether. The very heart of the community and its economic engine, it’s a bold experiment in voluntary incarceration. In exchange for a house, food, and what the online brochure hails as “A Meaningful Life,” residents agree to spend one month as inmates, the next as civilians, working as guards or whatever’s required.Stan and Charmaine have no complaints—until the day Stan discovers an erotic note under the fridge of the house he and Charmaine must share with another couple while they’re back inside Positron. It’s a missive of erotic longing, pressed with a vivid lipstick kiss: “I’m starved for you!” it breathes. If Stan rarely thought about the house’s other residents before—they’ve never met them and don’t know their names; it’s not allowed—now he can’t stop thinking about them, especially the note’s sex-addled author, a woman apparently named Jasmine, so unlike his girlish wife, Charmaine. He HAS to meet her, but in this highly ordered and increasingly surveilled world, disorderly thoughts are a risk, and breaking the rules has dire consequences.",1614520259,9781614520252),ebook,,64 pages,"

","Father Donavon held within him a terrible resolve. At every church he was assigned there would be several ""silent"" complaints about his character. He was a good priest and he lived according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Still, there existed a horrid undertone of malcontent and ambition.  The Church didn't really know what to do with him. If no one would work with Donavon, he was to be given his own church.  Upon taking command of Saint Marcus Church, Donavon entered a bizarre world that only Poe or Lovecraft could have created. An attractive and out-of-place housekeeper named Anna. Donavon's nightly dreams would flood with images of her lovely body. An old priest named Mavis who held within him a ""terrible secret"" which could only be controlled with a permanent drunken stupor. Also, a church no one in the neighborhood seemed to remember or worshiped within. Secrets within secrets, clouded occasionally with an overcast of mystery.  Donavon would soon learn the hidden horror behind Saint Marcus, and he would come to appreciate the devilishly insane power of THE SILENT PULPIT.",English,English,ebook,,50 pages,"

But when he gets there, nothing is what he thought it would be.

","""Great art has dreadful manners,"" Simon Schama observes wryly at the start of his epic and explosive exploration of the power, and whole point, of art. ""The hushed reverence of the gallery can fool you into believing masterpieces are polite things; visions that soothe, charm and beguile, but actually they are thugs. Merciless and wily, the greatest paintings grab you in a headlock, rough up your composure, and then proceed in short order to re-arrange your sense of reality. . . .""With the same disarming force, The Power of Art propels us on an eye-opening, breathtaking odyssey, zooming in on eight extraordinary masterpieces, from Caravaggio's David and Goliath to Picasso's Guernica. Jolting us far from the comfort zone of the hushed art gallery, Schama closes in on intense make-or-break turning points in the lives of eight great artists who, under extreme stress, created something unprecedented, altering the course of art forever.The embattled heroes—Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko—each in his own resolute way, faced crisis with steadfast defiance, pitting passion and conviction against scorn and short-sightedness. The masterpieces they created challenged convention, shattered complacency, shifted awareness and changed the way we look at the world.With vivid storytelling and powerfully evocative descriptive passages, Schama explores the dynamic personalities of the artists and the spirit of the times they lived through, capturing the flamboyant theatre of bourgeois life in Amsterdam, the passion and paranoia of Revolutionary Paris, and the carnage and pathos of Civil War Spain.Most compelling of all, The Power of Art traces the extraordinary evolution of eight ""eye-popping"" world-class works of art. Created in a bolt of illumination, such works ""tell us something about how the world is, how it is to be inside our skins, that no more prosaic source of wisdom can deliver. And when they do that, they answer, irrefutably and majestically, the nagging question of every reluctant art-conscript . . .

","In Harold Taw’s entertaining, sometimes bawdy, and often moving novel, Adventures of the Karaoke King, readers are quickly pulled into the vortex of the extremes of human emotions: passion, fear, hope, despair, and the longing for redemption and clarity.Guy Watanabe is a thirty-something man who is marginally in touch with his Asian heritage and completely out of touch with his own needs and desires. Recovering from a divorce, Watanabe is unsure of himself and the course his future might take. When he wins a local karaoke contest, he discovers not only a newfound confidence, but the courage to take risks. With the victor’s medallion in hand, he seizes the moment…and his life changes dramatically, albeit not as he might have hoped. From a weekend romp with Megumi, a former hooker, comes a physical beating and the loss of his beloved medallion. Stung by this humiliation, and yet able to muster a courage long dormant, his quest begins.From the western states and on to Asia, with a return trip in a shipping container, we follow his wild ride. Will a Korean barmaid be his downfall…or his redemption? Will Billy, a closeted gay man, or Milt, a heavily-armed dwarf, help Guy on his journey? And what about the patricidal Chinese businessman who will stop at nothing to create a global karaoke empire? So many people seeking the light, desperate to attain their dreams. And at the heart of their internal wars is Guy Watanabe’s quest for truth, hope, and self-discovery.",English,English,Paperback,,538 pages,"

The result is an electrifying novel of romantic suspense that will have readers burning through the pages.An unpretentious beauty who radiates kindness, Kate MacKenna doesn’t have a bad bone in her body–or an enemy in the world. So why are bombs igniting everywhere she goes? The first explosion brings her face-to-face with a handsome Charleston police detective. The second sends her into the arms of her best friend’s brother–a Boston cop who’s a little too reckless and way too charming for comfort. But Dylan Buchanan won’t let emotion prevent him from doing his job: Someone is trying to kill Kate, and Dylan is the only one standing between her and the monster who wants her dead.",0345453859,9780345453853),Mass Market Paperback,,424 pages,"

","(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)For the first time, all the major works of this beloved writer are gathered together in one hardcover volume. Poet, artist, and mystic, Kahlil Gibran was born in 1883 to a poor Christian family in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States as an adolescent. His masterpiece, The Prophet, a book of poetic essays that he began while still a youth in Lebanon, is one of the most cherished books of our time and has sold millions of copies in more than twenty languages since its publication in 1923. But all of Gibran’s works—essays, stories, parables, and prose poems—are imbued with equally powerful simplicity and wisdom, whether they are addressing marriage or children, friendship or grief, work or pleasure. Perhaps no other twentieth-century writer has touched the hearts and minds of so remarkably varied and widespread a readership. Included in this volume are The Prophet, The Wanderer, Jesus the Son of Man, A Tear and a Smile, Spirits Rebellious, Nymphs of the Valley, Prose Poems, The Garden of the Prophet, The Earth Gods, Sand and Foam, The Forerunner, and The Madman.",English,English,Hardcover,,888 pages,"

","The remarkable true story of three young girls who cross the harsh Australian desert on foot to return to their home. Following an Australian government edict in 1931, black aboriginal children and children of mixed marriages were gathered up by whites and taken to settlements to be assimilated. In Rabbit-Proof Fence, award-winning author Doris Pilkington traces the captivating story of her mother, Molly, one of three young girls uprooted from her community in Southwestern Australia and taken to the Moore River Native Settlement. At the settlement, Milly and her relatives Gracie and Daisy were forbidden to speak their native language, forced to abandon their aboriginal heritage, and taught to be culturally white. After regular stays in solitary confinement, the three girls scared and homesick planned and executed a daring escape from the grim camp, with its harsh life of padlocks, barred windows, and hard cold beds.The girls headed for the nearby rabbit-proof fence that stretched over 1,000 miles through the desert toward their home. Their journey lasted over a month, and they survived on everything from emus to feral cats, while narrowly avoiding the police, professional trackers, and hostile white settlers. Their story is a truly moving tale of defiance and resilience.About the author: Doris Pilkington is also the author of Caprice: A Stockman's Daughter. Rabbit-Proof Fence, her second book, is now a major motion picture from Miramax Films, directed by Phillip Noyce and starring Kenneth Branagh.",0786887842,9780786887842),Paperback,,135 pages,"

","""In a logical, well-articulated manner, Rosemond provides many examples, making this a practical rather than philosophical reference . . . Rosemond's thorough explanations and real-life examples make this a valuable resource for parents of both young and older children."" --Library JournalRenowned and respected family psychologist John Rosemond blames child-centered parenting books from recent decades for creating a generation of dependent, often defiant children. He sets the record straight in The New Six-Point Plan for Raising Happy, Healthy Children, an updated version of his highly successful book published more than fifteen years ago.Booms in technology and mass media have created significant changes in society in the last two decades. The text in this revised book has been thoroughly updated to reflect today's society, yet the foundation of Rosemond's timeless and effective approach remains constant. He encourages families to return to tried-and-true, fundamental parenting truths that people did naturally before the ""new science of parenting"":* Parents aren't their children's friends; they are their leaders.* Parents are at the center of a family-not kids.* Your marriage must come before your children.Each chapter includes easy-to-relate-to questions from parents, which Rosemond answers with both common sense and a sense of humor. For families feeling overwhelmed by competing advice about parenting, this book will ground them with logical, proven approaches to the most significant challenges parents face today. From issues such as self-esteem and discipline to television and chores, this straightforward guidance will facilitate a return to parent-centered families where children are raised into responsible adults.",0740760777,9780740760778),Hardcover,,328 pages,"

When Gabriella decides to finally let her angels know that she is alive, Joseph and an unexpected friend help her. The Darkness Illuminator is not as in control of her power as she believes, which makes for a very comedic and endearing relationship that blooms between the three. A fender-bender debacle, a run-in with the cops, and a hiccup at the airport seem to all be worth it until Gabriella finds out her plan has backfired.The three angels are missing, more mysteries pile up, and a new evil is brewing – so terrifying, in fact, that even the Soul Stalker herself is cowering in fear. Our heroine begins a jarring, romance-filled, heart-breaking journey that will lead her back to Italy, and ultimately to the answers she is desperately searching for.

","The key insight of Gaia Theory is that the entire Earth functions as a single living super-organism. But according to James Lovelock, the theory's originator, that organism is now sick. It is running a fever born of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. Earth will adjust to these stresses, but the human race faces a severe test. It is already too late, Lovelock says, to prevent the global climate from ""flipping"" into an entirely new equilibrium that will threaten civilization as we know it. But we can do much to save humanity. In the tradition of ""Silent Spring,"" this is a call to address a major threat to our collective future.",0141035358,9780141035352),Paperback,,,"

But something went wrong. Several young patients died under mysterious circumstances. Eventually, the hospital was shut down, the building abandoned and left to rot deep in the woods.As the new kid in town, Neil Cady wants to see Graylock for himself. Especially since rumor has it that the building is haunted. He's got fresh batteries in his flashlight, a camera to document the adventure, and a new best friend watching his back.Neil might think he's prepared for what he'll find in the dark and decrepit asylum. But he's certainly not prepared for what follows him home. . . .Scary, suspenseful, and surprising, Dan Poblocki's latest ghost story will keep you turning pages deep into the dead of night.",0545402689,9780545402682),Hardcover,,258 pages,"

","Somewhere in North Dakota, there is a town called Owl that isn't there. Disco is over, but punk never happened. They don't have cable. They don't really have pop culture, unless you count grain prices and alcoholism. People work hard and then they die. They hate the government and impregnate teenage girls. But that's not nearly as awful as it sounds; in fact, sometimes it's perfect.Mitch Hrlicka lives in Owl. He plays high school football and worries about his weirdness, or lack thereof. Julia Rabia just moved to Owl. She gets free booze and falls in love with a self-loathing bison farmer who listens to Goats Head Soup. Horace Jones has resided in Owl for seventy-three years. He consumes a lot of coffee, thinks about his dead wife, and understands the truth. They all know each other completely, except that they've never met.Like a colder, Reagan-era version of The Last Picture Show fused with Friday Night Lights, Chuck Klosterman's Downtown Owl is the unpretentious, darkly comedic story of how it feels to exist in a community where rural mythology and violent reality are pretty much the same thing. Loaded with detail and unified by a (very real) blizzard, it's technically about certain people in a certain place at a certain time...but it's really about a problem. And the problem is this: What does it mean to be a normal person? And there is no answer. But in Downtown Owl, what matters more is how you ask the question.",1416544186,9781416544180),Hardcover,,275 pages,"

","‘Debits and Credits’ is a collection of anguished and bleak stories written by an author struggling with his own inner sufferings. Marital discord and adultery, war and death, cancer and disease are recurring themes throughout the stories, with the relentless ticking of the clock acting as a harbinger of greater sorrows. Concealed within the prose are reflections of Kipling’s own life, and faint echoes of his dying reputation as a once-famed writer. Amongst such anguish, however, there are faint glimmers of hope and an expectation of what is to come.",English,English,Paperback,,348 pages,"

","When Michael Moorcock began chronicling the adventures of the albino sorcerer Elric, last king of decadent Melniboné, and his sentient vampiric sword, Stormbringer, he set out to create a new kind of fantasy adventure, one that broke with tradition and reflected a more up-to-date sophistication of theme and style. The result was a bold and unique hero–weak in body, subtle in mind, dependent on drugs for the vitality to sustain himself–with great crimes behind him and a greater destiny ahead: a rock-and-roll antihero who would channel all the violent excesses of the sixties into one enduring archetype.Here is the first volume of a collection of stories containing the seminal appearances of Elric and lavishly illustrated by artist John Picacio–plus essays, letters, maps, and other material. Adventures include “The Dreaming City,” “While the Gods Laugh,” “Kings in Darkness,” “Dead God’s Homecoming,” “Black Sword’s Brothers,” and “Sad Giant’s Shield.”",0345498623,9780345498625),Paperback,,458 pages,"

","It all begins with an ad in the newspaper. When Jean Sasson, a young Southern woman, answers a call to work in the royal hospital in Saudi Arabia, what should have been a two-year stay turns into a life-changing adventure spanning over a decade. Jean is plunged into the hidden lives of the veiled women in Riyadh, where women are locked in luxurious homes and fundamentalist mutawas terrorize the streets. Jean meets women from all walks of life--a feisty bedouin, an educated mother, and a conservative wife of a high-ranking Saudi--all who open a window into Saudi culture and help to reshape Jean's worldviews. What follows is a heartfelt, inspiring memoir about Jean's new-found conviction to fight for women's rights in a country of limited personal freedom.

","Mockstrich season has begun. Welcome to ""The Hunger But Mainly Death Games,"" the hilarious Hunger Games parody, and the only book brave enough to suggest that Suzanne Collins's epic trilogy was way more about death than food.Or at least this is what Bratniss Everclean discovers, when she leaves the comforts of Slum 12, Pandumb’s garbage dump, to shortsightedly volunteer for a teenage death tournament. But she soon realizes there are fates worse than death…like weirdly having to date her fellow competitor, and lifelong stalker, Pita Malarkey. Okay, okay, it’s not worse than DEATH, but it’s still pretty annoying.Still, with help from her agent Oofie Triptrip and her mentor, Hagridmitch, who’s pretty sure he can guide Bratniss to victory in the Tri-Wizard Cup, maybe Bratniss will somehow survive this book that she’s the narrator of. “The Hunger But Mainly Death Games” is the perfect book for anyone who’s going through Hunger Games withdrawal and ready for a wonderfully twisted take on their favorite story and characters. This book is also for the unfortunate teens who are trapped in a Hunger Games at this very moment and could really benefit from some levity.

It couldn’t be ignored—only indulged, evolving into a bond of pleasurable subjugation. But Francesca’s open sensuality left her wanting more. Getting it from a man as mysterious and resolute as Ian was a challenge she never anticipated.Francesca knows there’s only one way for them to move forward–to follow Ian to London and show him that she doesn’t want him to suffer alone. But when Ian’s past and inner torment is revealed, he experiences a nearly unbearable volcanic mix of emotions for the woman who has dared to love him, despite his inner demons. After exposing Francesca to the limits of his anguish, he wonders if he’s lost her forever. Can he bend enough to compromise to true intimacy…and something called love?",9781101608562,9781101608562,ebook,Nook,53 pages,"

","An unvarnished, unauthorized, behind-the-scenes account of one of the most dominant pop cultural forces in contemporary AmericaOperating out of a tiny office on Madison Avenue in the early 1960s, a struggling company called Marvel Comics presented a cast of brightly costumed characters distinguished by smart banter and compellingly human flaws. Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Captain America, the Incredible Hulk, the Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, the X-Men, Daredevil—these superheroes quickly won children's hearts and sparked the imaginations of pop artists, public intellectuals, and campus radicals. Over the course of a half century, Marvel's epic universe would become the most elaborate fictional narrative in history and serve as a modern American mythology for millions of readers.Throughout this decades-long journey to becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise, Marvel's identity has continually shifted, careening between scrappy underdog and corporate behemoth. As the company has weathered Wall Street machinations, Hollywood failures, and the collapse of the comic book market, its characters have been passed along among generations of editors, artists, and writers—also known as the celebrated Marvel ""Bullpen."" Entrusted to carry on tradition, Marvel's contributors—impoverished child prodigies, hallucinating peaceniks, and mercenary careerists among them—struggled with commercial mandates, a fickle audience, and, over matters of credit and control, one another.For the first time, Marvel Comics reveals the outsized personalities behind the scenes, including Martin Goodman, the self-made publisher who forayed into comics after a get-rich-quick tip in 1939; Stan Lee, the energetic editor who would shepherd the company through thick and thin for decades; and Jack Kirby, the World War II veteran who'd co-created Captain America in 1940 and, twenty years later, developed with Lee the bulk of the company's marquee characters in a three-year frenzy of creativity that would be the grounds for future legal battles and endless debates.Drawing on more than one hundred original interviews with Marvel insiders then and now, Marvel Comics is a story of fertile imaginations, lifelong friendships, action-packed fistfights, reformed criminals, unlikely alliances, and third-act betrayals— a narrative of one of the most extraordinary, beloved, and beleaguered pop cultural entities in America's history.",0061992100,9780061992100),Hardcover,,485 pages,"

","JUMPING SHIP: AN INTRODUCTORY NOVELLAThe year was nineteen seventy-five. Barren couple, Pearl and Edward Riley stumbled upon a newborn baby girl. Her cries could only be heard by a true mother, which Pearl immediately became. Bundled up with their new child, they discovered a parcel of artifacts and a scribbled note that read: Sakkara. Pregnant seamstress, Petrina Dugal, became a runaway at the age of twenty-six. She ran away from a brutish husband, Roger, and a well-loved South American home in Georgetown, Guyana; at the heart of her rebellion – an enigmatic lover named Michael Chen. Pet and Mikey, as they became affectionately known, allowed love to blossom in front of her police officer husband and an intrusive community. Were they not aware of the dangers? Or did the pursuit of love trump obligations?Sakkara Riley grew up with two loving parents – adoptive parents to be exact. She never knew the circumstances surrounding her discovery, until the age of sixteen. She embarks on a journey.Jumping Ship is an introductory novella to the Island Hopping Series. There are 7 planned books - representing each of the islands that Sakkara will visit along the way.Book Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXYR2...",English,English,Paperback,,90 pages,"

","In his celebrated bestsellers Agent Zigzag and Operation Mincemeat, Ben Macintyre told the dazzling true stories of a remarkable WWII double agent and of how the Allies employed a corpse to fool the Nazis and assure a decisive victory.  In Double Cross, Macintyre returns with the untold story of the grand final deception of the war and of the extraordinary spies who achieved it.   On June 6, 1944, 150,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy and suffered an astonishingly low rate of casualties.  D-Day was a stunning military accomplishment, but it was also a masterpiece of trickery. Operation Fortitude, which protected and enabled the invasion, and the Double Cross system, which specialized in turning German spies into double agents, deceived the Nazis into believing that the Allies would attack at Calais and Norway rather than Normandy. It was the most sophisticated and successful deception operation ever carried out, ensuring that Hitler kept an entire army awaiting a fake invasion, saving thousands of lives, and securing an Allied victory at the most critical juncture in the war.   The story of D-Day has been told from the point of view of the soldiers who fought in it, the tacticians who planned it, and the generals who led it. But this epic event in world history has never before been told from the perspectives of the key individuals in the Double Cross System. These include its director (a brilliant, urbane intelligence officer), a colorful assortment of MI5 handlers (as well as their counterparts in Nazi intelligence), and the five spies who formed Double Cross’s nucleus: a dashing  Serbian playboy, a Polish fighter-pilot, a bisexual Peruvian party girl, a deeply eccentric Spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming and a volatile Frenchwoman, whose obsessive love for her pet dog very nearly wrecked the entire plan. The D-Day spies were, without question, one of the oddest military units ever assembled, and their success depended on the delicate, dubious relationship between spy and spymaster, both German and British. Their enterprise was saved from catastrophe by a shadowy sixth spy whose heroic sacrifice is revealed here for the first time.   With the same depth of research, eye for the absurd and masterful storytelling that have made Ben Macintyre an international bestseller,  Double Cross is a captivating narrative of the spies who wove a web so intricate it ensnared Hitler’s army and carried thousands of D-Day troops across the Channel in safety.",0307990443,9780307990440),Paperback,,399 pages,"

Drug-dependent and mentally ill, but desperate to keep hold of her daughter, Alice's mother snatches her from her parents' house and disappears.Cathy spends three anxious days worrying about her whereabouts before Alice is found safe, but traumatised. Alice is like a little doll, so young and vulnerable, and she immediately finds her place in the heart of Cathy's family. She talks openly about her mummy, who she dearly loves, and how happy she was living with her maternal grandparents before she was put into care. Alice has clearly been very well looked after and Cathy can't understand why she couldn't stay with her grandparents.It emerges that Alice's grandparents are considered too old (they are in their early sixties) and that the plan is that Alice will stay with Cathy for a month before moving to live with her father and his new wife. The grandparents are distraught – Alice has never known her father, and her grandparents claim he is a violent drug dealer.Desperate to help Alice find the happy home she deserves, Cathy's parenting skills are tested in many new ways. Finally questions are asked about Alice's father suitability, and his true colours begin to emerge.",0007267444,9780007267446),Paperback,,368 pages,"

And the aristocratic Hadrian-the Empress's ruthless protégé and Vix's mortal enemy-has ambitions he confesses to no one, ambitions rooted in a secret prophecy.When Trajan falls, the hardened soldier, the enigmatic empress, the adventurous girl, and the scheming politician will all be caught in a deadly whirlwind of desire and death that may seal their fates, and that of the entire Roman Empire...",075538105X,9780755381050),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","Be Transformed by Christ’s Example “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” —1 Peter 5:5 A battle rages within every one of us every day. It’s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God’s call to recognize that we’re really nothing without Him. It’s pride versus humility. And it’s a fight we can’t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God’s abundant favor. “This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit.” —Isaiah 66:2, ESV God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He’s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated.

He recruits a more experienced sailor-another brokenhearted guy-and together they set sail for Tahiti, hoping to burn away their miseries in hard miles at sea.At first Patterson finds life under sail distinctly less heroic than the travel literature that has inspired him.

","History is a mirror of the past days and nights of nations and communities. Hence the history of Islam is not only a mirror of the fourteen centuries of the Muslim Ummah but it also signifies the best human civilization on the face of the earth. So a stark necessity arises to acquaint new generations of the Muslim Ummah with great intellectual and political leaders and renowned personalities along with such men of achievements and valiant heroes who defeated false forces in battlefields in order to propagate the true religion in those lands where darkness of paganism and ignorance prevailed. ‘Atlas of the Islamic Conquests’ has been prepared in view of the same lofty aim. In it events of consecutive days, months and years of major Islamic conquest conquests, starting from the period of the first Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq (may Allah be pleaed with him) to the reign of Ottoman Caliph Murad III, have been described, with four coloured maps and unique snaps, in such a manner that the reader goes along with them and comes across wonderful historical happenings and new secrets of history are disclosed to him. Make thorough study of ‘Atlas of the Islamic Conquests’ yourself and motivate your children, kith and kins and friends to study it. This unique atlas, having intrinsic and apparent beauty, is a masterpiece of history and research and a rich present for English readers.",B00DRIU02U,B00DRIU02U,ebook,,182 pages,"

","“It’s not like the movies, where they don’t know they’re dead. They don’t often haunt people or places for revenge, and as far as I know they don’t befriend lonely children. Usually. If you could see them, you might not even know them from some of the living. Empty-eyed and looking around at the world like they can’t believe it’s all still there and going on without them. Or maybe they’re seeing it for the first time. This city is full of ghosts. I can see them all. Lucky me.”Niki Slobodian sees things – things that aren't supposed to be there. Labeled an Abnormal by New Government, her name is tacked onto the Registry, which seems to be getting longer these days. Now she can't work or she'll end up the same place as her father: in prison. But with no money coming in, Niki's getting desperate. So when a mysterious client offers to get her off the Registry in exchange for taking his case, Niki jumps at the chance. All she has to do is round up a homicidal Dark that's escaped from Hell and is cruising around the city in borrowed bodies. The murders are piling up, with Niki's notorious father somehow involved, and Niki's running out of time. And it seems the Dark isn't the only thing that escaped...",English,English,Kindle Edition,,192 pages,"

Peter Vincent is nearly 16, and has never thought about the things that Strakerites believe. His father – David Vincent, creator of the artificial bees that saved the world’s crops – made sure of that. When the Strakerites pronounce that another upgrade is imminent, Peter starts to uncover a conspiracy amongst the leaders of the establishment, a conspiracy that puts him into direct conflict with his father.

","The Argonautica is the dramatic story of Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece and his relations with the dangerous princess Medea. The only surviving Greek epic to bridge the gap between Homer and late antiquity, this epic poem is the crowning literary achievement of the Ptolemaic court at Alexandria, written by Appolonius of Rhodes in the third century BC. Appollonius explores many of the fundamental aspects of life in a highly original way: love, deceit, heroism, human ignorance of the divine, and the limits of science, and offers a gripping and sometimes disturbing tale in the process.

Castaneda describes how don Juan and his party, left thisworld—""the warriors of don Juan’s party had caught me for an eternal instant, before they vanished into the total light, before the Eagle let them go through""—and how he, himself, upon witnessing such a sight, jumped into the abyss.",067173251X,9780671732516),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","In 1902, in a dark room on the fifth floor of Carnegie Hall, thirteen people came together to continue a tradition that had been set in stone thousands of years before. In 2012, Leah Tallent is Head of Research at the New York Public Library. Stoic and stable, brilliant and cynical, she has forever enjoyed her existence among the book stacks. But even with her unparalleled intellect, there was no way to know that on the historic steps between America's famous lions, she would become involved with a crazy man on a fanatical quest.Gareth Lowery has spent his life searching for the ultimate artifact that he is certain exists. His life's pursuit has been to retrieve twelve keys hidden by men whose job it was to protect the single biggest secret ever kept.

","*Please note this book is dark romance and deals with serious themes including rape, violence and murder.*  This story unfolds over seven volumes approx. 25 - 30,000 words each.  My father taught me the importance of an eye for an eye—a cardinal rule, ingrained in every club member.  A life for a life.  Seven lives in payment for an unimaginable list of sins.  People might wonder why I’m doing this. If this vengeance is borne from some noble cause, that I’m trying to prevent others from suffering at the hands of Dornan Ross and his sons.  But I’m no vigilante.  I’m doing it for me. I’m doing it because I want to. Because the look on Maxi and Chad’s faces when I killed them was a balm to my soul.  This is the fate they have earned. The penance for their crimes.  Two down, five to go.  Time to send some of these brothers off with a bang.    Five Miles is the third book in the Gypsy Brothers series.

","In The Monkey Wars, Deborah Blum offers a wide-ranging, informative look at animal activists, now numbering some twelve million, from the moderate Animal Welfare Institute to the highly radical Animal Liberation Front (a group destructive enough to be placed on the FBI's terrorist list). And she interviews a wide variety of researchers, many forced to conduct their work protected by barbed wire and alarm systems, men and women for whom death threats and hate mail are common. She takes us to Roger Fouts's research center in Ellensburg, Washington, where we meet five chimpanzees trained in human sign language - Loulis, Tatu, Mojha, Dar, and the most famous, Washoe - and watch the flicker of their fingers as they talk to each other, to themselves, and to stuffed animals (which Fouts sees as a clear sign of intelligence and even more - imagination). Blum introduces us to Alex Pacheco, a founder of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, and to his bitter enemy, Peter Gerone, head of the federal primate center at Tulane and an outspoken critic of animal rights activists, who wants people to think about the trade-off at its most fundamental level - human life versus animal life. And we visit LEMSIP, a research facility in New York State that has no barbed wire, no alarms - and no protesters chanting outside - because its director, Jan Moor-Jankowski, listens to activists with respect. Along the way, Blum offers us insights into the many side-issues involved: scientists (like Roger Fouts) who lose funding because they support animal rights, the intense battle to win over school kids fought by both sides, the danger of transplanting animal organs into humans (it could possibly unleash adeadly, highly infectious disease), and the concerns over dwindling monkey populations.",019510109X,9780195101096),Paperback,,334 pages,"

","Cliff Miglioretti hasn't had an easy life. In fact, much of it has been an obscene nightmare. As a very young child, he was exposed to traumas that would have broken most adults, first as he watched his drug-using father abuse his eleven-year-old sister in ways he could not understand. A few months later, that sister was cruelly taken from life, and finally, in self-pity or perhaps guilt, Cliff's father committed suicide as well. And there are more unspeakable secrets from his teen years that no other living soul knows about. Now in college, Cliff is a shell of despair, addicted to self-harm and consumed with self-blame. Wretchedly depressed, bitterly cynical, and unable to interact positively with peers, he has never had a single friend in his life. Until now. Liz Butler is unlike anyone Cliff has met. Outgoing, always positive, and beautiful in more ways than Cliff can believe, she attaches herself to him after he impulsively stands up to a bully on her behalf at school. Soon her smiles and uplifting attitude begin to reach him, and Cliff becomes part of Liz's fiercely tight family circle, which includes her brother Jim and sister-in-law Beth. Incredibly, Liz's love begins to heal him. But the road to recovery is not a short one for someone so deeply tormented. And in the end, Cliff finds he must fight one more horrible battle, and learn the true meanings of love and forgiveness, in order to attain true personal redemption.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,294 pages,"

","It is the first job interview of her life, and Romaisa is totally unqualified for the job, and she knows it. Just a high school graduate, she knows she can’t compete with other girls in the interview room, with their glossy degrees, glamorous appearances and polished looks. Clad in a long ‘chaadar’ and sporting a makeup-free face, Romaisa knows she is a misfit. Till she is spotted by the Prince Charming. Nabeel Sikandar, the knight in shining armor for Romaisa, hires her instantly as his secretary. Besotted with her, he marries her just after a month, against all odds. And like all fairy tales, this one too, only lasts a few moments.  Life has a way of acting as a spectator and throwing all kinds of surprises our way, just to see how we flounder. Widowed after few short months of marriage, Romaisa soon realizes how her life before Nabeel wasn’t half as bad. Humiliated, insulted, rejected and tortured, Romaisa passively endures, keeping her little daughter as her connection to sanity. And then the moment it seems the bleak night will last forever, the sun bursts in, full of glory and magnificence. The horse-ridden carriage had turned back into a pumpkin at the stroke of midnight, but the Prince has sent troops with the glass slipper to look for his lost Cinderella. Will the shoe fit Romaisa again?",English,English,Kindle Edition,,,"

Er will sich nicht damit abfinden, dass Deutschland nicht nur älter und kleiner, sondern auch dümmer und abhängiger von staatlichen Zahlungen wird. Sarrazin sieht genau hin, seine Analyse schont niemanden. Er zeigt ganz konkret, wie wir die Grundlagen unseres Wohlstands untergraben und so den sozialen Frieden und eine stabile Gesellschaft aufs Spiel setzen. Deutschland läuft Gefahr, in einen Alptraum zu schlittern. Dass das so ist, weshalb das so ist und was man dagegen tun kann, davon handelt dieses Buch.",German,German,Hardcover,,463 pages,"

But now that she’s been transplanted to rural Louisiana, she has decided that this fake identity will be her last. Witness Protection has taken nearly everything from her. But for now, they’ve given her a new name, Megan Rose Jones, and a horrible hair color. For the past eight months, Meg has begged her father to answer one question: What on earth did he do – or see – that landed them in this god-awful mess? Meg has just about had it with all the Suits’ rules — and her dad’s silence. If he won’t help, it’s time she got some answers for herself. But Meg isn’t counting on Ethan Landry, an adorable Louisiana farm boy who’s too smart for his own good. He knows Meg is hiding something big. And it just might get both of them killed.

","Sang ulama multidisipliner. Di Timur, Ibnu Khaldun disebut al-‘Allamah (Mahaguru). Di Barat, digelari the Polymath (penghimpun berbagai bidang pengetahuan). Namun, di atas segalanya, ia menelaah semua kajiannya dengan kadar ilmiah yang tinggi, dan tak diragukan lagi sangat berkontribusi atas perkembangan ilmu pengetahuan manusia. Lahir di Tunisia pada 732 H/1332 M, ia langsung menghadapi berbagai kemelut sosial-politik yang terjadi di depan matanya. Dengan terombang ambing dalam berbagai konflik, ia menjalani kehidupannya dengan penuh bahaya dan petualangan. Terkadang, ia menang; di lain waktu ia kalah. Yang mengagumkan, dalam kondisi demikian ia mampu menelurkan karya-karya brilian. Mulai dari sejarah, sosiologi, hingga ilmu agama. Terinspirasi metode Ibnu Khaldun, penulis menceritakan perikehidupan Sang Sejarawan dengan berimbang. Ditopang kajian literatur yang kuat, buku ini menghadirkan kehidupan Ibnu Khaldun apa adanya. Bersahaja. Dengan begitu, buku ini menjadi semacam cermin atas kehidupan Ibnu Khaldun. Dengan cermin ini kita berharap bisa melihat sejauh mana kemajuan dan perkembangan ilmu pengetahuan sejak beliau hingga saat ini.",9789790243415,9789790243415,Paperback,,224 pages,"

","The ""baby bible"" of the post-Dr. Spock generation, already embraced by hundreds of thousands of American parents, has now been revised, expanded, and brought thoroughly up-to-date -- with the latest information on everything from diapering to day care, from midwifery to hospital birthing rooms, from postpartum nutrition to infant development. Dr. Bill and Martha Sears draw from their vast experience both as medical professionals and as the parents of eight children to provide comprehensive information on virtually every aspect of infant care. Working for the first time with their sons Dr. Bob and Dr. Jim, both pediatric specialists in their own right, the Searses have produced a completely updated guide that is unrivaled in its scope and authority. The Baby Book focuses on the essential needs of babies -- cating, sleeping, development, health, and comfort -- as it addresses the questions of greatest concern to today's parents. The Baby Book presents a practical, contemporary approach to parenting that reflects the way we live today. The Searses acknowledge that there is no one way to parent a baby, and they offer the basic guidance and inspiration you need to develop the parenting style that best suits you and your child. The Baby Book is a rich and invaluable resource that will help you get the most out of parenting -- for your child, for yourself, and for your entire family.",English,English,Paperback,,784 pages,"

","Logo depois de voltar da guerra em Angola, António Lobo Antunes escreve Os cus de Judas, sobre suas experiências naquele país. O romance se tornou um enorme sucesso, vindo a ser o primeiro grande livro sobre o conflito e a independência angolanos e uma referência histórica obrigatória.Numa narrativa não-linear e fragmentada, Lobo Antunes revela as inquietações existenciais de um ser humano, na indelével experiência de uma guerra, que se misturam às memórias de infância e juventude na Lisboa salazarista. O autor utiliza-se, na maior parte do romance, do fluxo de consciência e da associação de idéias, para construir a história e o perfil de seu narrador-protagonista, um personagem que, a partir de ""uma dolorosa aprendizagem da agonia"", vê sua vida e seus valores estilhaçados pela melancolia. O que lhe resta são fragmentos de memória - a criança que visitava com os pais o jardim zoológico aos domingos, o jovem que assiste impassível a seu futuro sendo traçado pela autoridade inquestionável de uma família salazarista, o adulto apático e frustrado diante da violência que lhe retira as rédeas e o sentido da vida.O leitor vai estar frente a frente com ""decadência, putrefação, pestilência e morte. Adicionando canalhice, violência e insensatez"". Para o jornalista português Nuno Barbosa, ""Lobo Antunes, dando plena expressão a uma escrita impiedosa e grosseira consegue uma harmonia preciosa entre a violência do narrado e a rudez dos termos utilizados - as suas palavras ganham, portanto, uma credibilidade muito maior, criando um elo profundo com a realidade.""O livro, que recebeu o prêmio Franco-Português conferido pela Embaixada da França em Lisboa, está na 21.ª edição em Portugal e já foi vendido para mais de dez países como Inglaterra, França, Itália, Alemanha e Suécia.",972202759X,972202759X,Paperback,,200 pages,"

This collection also includes an excerpt from Requiem, the final novel in Oliver's New York Times bestselling series.Hana is told through the perspective of Lena's best friend, Hana Tate. Set during the tumultuous summer before Lena and Hana are supposed to be cured, this story is a poignant and revealing look at a moment when the girls' paths diverge and their futures are altered forever.Lena's mother, Annabel, has always been a mystery--a ghost from Lena's past--until now. Her journey from teenage runaway to prisoner of the state is a taut, gripping narrative that expands the Delirium world and illuminates events--and Lena--through a new point of view.And as the passionate, fierce leader of a rebel group in the Wilds, Raven plays an integral role in the resistance effort and comes into Lena's life at a crucial time.

","TWO MILLION DOLLARS...    It’s the kind of score Karyn Ames has always dreamed of—enough to set her crew up pretty well and, more important, enough to keep her safely stocked on a very rare, very expensive black market drug. Without it, Karyn hallucinates slices of the future until they totally overwhelm her, leaving her unable to distinguish the present from the mess of certainties and possibilities yet to come.   The client behind the heist is Enoch Sobell, a notorious crime lord with a reputation for being ruthless and exacting—and a purported practitioner of dark magic. Sobell is almost certainly condemned to Hell for a magically extended lifetime full of shady dealings.

","Sophie Barrett Thinks She's Lucky To Be Alive. She May Be Dead Wrong.On a sweltering summer afternoon, Sophie Barrett walks into a nightmare. A sniper has opened fire on a college campus. When the carnage is over, three people - plus the shooter - are dead and dozens more are injured. Sophie escapes virtually unscathed. Yet as details emerge from the investigation, she becomes convinced that this wasn't the random, senseless act it appeared to be. No one wants to believe her - not the cops, not her colleagues at the Delphi Center crime lab, and definitely not Jonah Macon, the homicide detective who’s already saved her life once.Jonah has all kinds of reasons for hoping Sophie is mistaken. Involving himself with a key witness could derail an already messy investigation, not to mention jeopardize his career. But Sophie is as determined and fearless as she is sexy. If he can’t resist her, he can at least swear to protect her. Because if Sophie is right, she’s made herself the target of a killer without a conscience. And the real terror is only just beginning....",English,English,Mass Market Paperback,Pocket Star Romance,401 pages,"

","This is part 3 in a paranormal romance serial Two years ago, curvy she-wolf Aspen ran from her pack and her future as alpha female, where she was expected to choose handsome, blue-eyed Rafe, son of the current alpha, as mate and the next alpha of the pack. Now she’s back and living with three sexy former friends and pack mates, including Rafe, who promises to protect her from wolfish advances long enough for her to choose one of three potential future alphas without pressure.  Of course Rafe wants Aspen to choose him, and it has nothing to do with wanting to be alpha and everything to do with his feelings for the curvaceous she-wolf. But Aspen doesn't believe that, and it'll take time to convince her.  Time Rafe may not have, between a rogue wolf stalking Aspen and Aspen emitting pheromones that are making the other males in the house increasingly desperate to claim her for their own.  Important note from the author! Alpha Games is a romance serial about a female wolf shifter and the three sexy alphas she’s destined to choose between. The story is told in novella length episodes with cliffhangers. I’ve priced each part low enough that by the time you have purchased all parts, you’ll only have paid the price of one book (99 cents for each part). I know that this format isn’t for everyone, but I love serials and find they keep things exciting for me as a writer. I hope you enjoy if you decide to still read it.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,50 pages,"

In this tale revolving around not just parents and children but brothers and sisters, cousins and caretakers, Hosseini explores the many ways in which families nurture, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for one another; and how often we are surprised by the actions of those closest to us, at the times that matter most. Following its characters and the ramifications of their lives and choices and loves around the globe—from Kabul to Paris to San Francisco to the Greek island of Tinos—the story expands gradually outward, becoming more emotionally complex and powerful with each turning page.",B009XIXVU6,B009XIXVU6,Kindle Edition,,416 pages,"

","Ice As president of the Predators’ MC, my men and I are used to preying on the weak and those stupid enough to cross our paths. So why does a straitlaced teacher make me sit up and take notice when I see her for the first time? The brothers all think she makes me weak, and believe me, weak in their eyes isn’t where I want to be. She wants me to prove she means more to me than the club, and when I fail, she thinks she can just walk away. She’s wrong. I’m a Predator, and nothing escapes me. Grace As a teacher, I’m supposed to want to educate those who want to learn, right? That’s what I believed until I was told I’d have to teach a class at the prison. I didn’t move to a town labeled as one of the safest places in America only to be faced with a bunch of Predators. He expects me to trust him despite being the reason I’m trapped in the middle of a prison riot. His club means more to him than I ever will, and if I give him a chance, he will break the fragile peace I have managed to find. It’s not the first time I’ve had to escape a predator.

","'The mind is a time machine that travels backwards in memory and forwards in prophecy, but he has done with prophecy now...'Sequestered in his blitz-battered Regent's Park house in 1944, the ailing Herbert George Wells, 'H.G.' to his family and friends, looks back on a life crowded with incident, books, and women. Has it been a success or a failure? Once he was the most famous writer in the world, 'the man who invented tomorrow'; now he feels like yesterday's man, deserted by readers and depressed by the collapse of his utopian dreams.He recalls his unpromising start, and early struggles to acquire an education and make a living as a teacher; his rapid rise to fame as a writer with a prophetic imagination and a comic common touch which brought him into contact with most of the important literary, intellectual, and political figures of his time; his plunge into socialist politics; his belief in free love, and energetic practice of it. Arguing with himself about his conduct, he relives his relationships with two wives and many mistresses, especially the brilliant student Amber Reeves and the gifted writer Rebecca West, both of whom bore him children, with dramatic and long-lasting consequences.Unfolding this astonishing story, David Lodge depicts a man as contradictory as he was talented: a socialist who enjoyed his affluence, an acclaimed novelist who turned against the literary novel; a feminist womaniser, sensual yet incurably romantic, irresistible and exasperating by turns, but always vitally human.",1846554969,9781846554964),Hardcover,,565 pages,"

One is a Hungarian bastard peasant boy touched by brilliance, the other the sole heir to an Austrian aristocratic family desperately clinging to the prerogatives of noble birth.

It’s 1900 in Oregon, and Olivia’s father, concerned that she’s headed for trouble, convinces a stage mesmerist to try to hypnotize the rebellion out of her. But the hypnotist, an intriguing young man named Henri Reverie, gives her a terrible gift instead: she’s able to see people’s true natures, manifesting as visions of darkness and goodness, while also unable to speak her true thoughts out loud. These supernatural challenges only make Olivia more determined to speak her mind, and so she’s drawn into a dangerous relationship with the hypnotist and his mysterious motives, all while secretly fighting for the rights of women. Winters breathes new life into history once again with an atmospheric, vividly real story, including archival photos and art from the period throughout.",B00OL8M6G8,B00OL8M6G8,Audible Audio,,,"

","After the best-selling Arthur & George and Nothing to Be Frightened Of, Julian Barnes returns with fourteen stories about longing and loss, friendship and love, whose mysterious natures he examines with his trademark wit and observant eye. From an imperial capital in the eighteenth century to Garibaldi's adventures in the nineteenth, from the vineyards of Italy to the English seaside in our time, he finds the ""stages, transitions, arguments"" that define us. A newly divorced real estate agent can't resist invading his reticent girlfriend's privacy, but the information he finds reveals only his callously shallow curiosity. A couple come together through an illicit cigarette and a song shared over the din of a Chinese restaurant. A widower revisiting the Scottish island he'd treasured with his wife learns how difficult it is to purge oneself of grief. And throughout, friends gather regularly at dinner parties and perfect the art of cerebral, sometimes bawdy banter about the world passing before them.Whether domestic or extraordinary, each story pulses with the resonance, spark, and poignant humor for which Barnes is justly heralded.",0224091085,9780224091084),Hardcover,,228 pages,"

","Available in English for the first time, Marie Vieux-Chauvet’s stunning trilogy of novellas is a remarkable literary event. In a brilliant translation by Rose-Myriam Réjouis and Val Vinokur, Love, Anger, Madness is a scathing response to the struggles of race, class, and sex that have ruled Haiti. Suppressed upon its initial publication in 1968, this major work became an underground classic and was finally released in an authorized edition in France in 2005.In Love, Anger, Madness, Marie Vieux-Chauvet offers three slices of life under an oppressive regime. Gradually building in emotional intensity, the novellas paint a shocking portrait of families and artists struggling to survive under Haiti’s terrifying government restrictions that have turned its society upside down, transforming neighbors into victims, spies, and enemies.In “Love,” Claire is the eldest of three sisters who occupy a single house. Her dark skin and unmarried status make her a virtual servant to the rest of the family. Consumed by an intense passion for her brother-in-law, she finds redemption in a criminal act of rebellion.In “Anger,” a middle-class family is ripped apart when twenty-year-old Rose is forced to sleep with a repulsive soldier in order to prevent a government takeover of her father’s land.And in “Madness,” René, a young poet, finds himself trapped in a house for days without food, obsessed with the souls of the dead, dreading the invasion of local military thugs, and steeling himself for one final stand against authority. Sympathetic, savage and truly compelling with an insightful introduction by Edwidge Danticat, Love, Anger, Madness is an extraordinary, brave and graphic evocation of a country in turmoil.",0679643516,9780679643517),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

Working for an ogre of a boss doesn't help.Then, seemingly out of the blue, Katie gets a job offer from Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., a company that provides tricks of the trade to the magic community.

Suddenly, average Katie is very special indeed.

The passionate kisses and the fairy-tale ending? Or is it a lifetime of tragedy, paid in advance, for a few stolen moments of pure bliss? The pain and the suffering that, in the end, you can say are worth it for having found the missing piece of your soul? The answer is: I don’t know. I don’t know what makes a great love story.

","For every great historical event, seemingly, at least one reporter writes an eyewitness account of such power and literary weight that it becomes joined with its subject in our minds-George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia and the Spanish Civil War; John Hersey's Hiroshima and the dropping of the first atomic bomb; Philip Gourevitch's We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families: Stories of Rwanda and the Rwandan genocide. Whatever else is written about the Iraqi people and the fall of Saddam, Jon Lee Anderson's The Fall of Baghdad is worthy of mention in this company. No subject has become more hotly politicized than the toppling of Saddam Hussein's regime, and so a thick fog of propaganda, both from boosters of the war and its opponents, has obscured the reality of what the Iraqi people have endured and are enduring, under Saddam Hussein and now. For that reason alone, The Fall of Baghdad is a great and necessary book. Jon Lee Anderson has drawn on all of his reserves of stamina and personal bravery to create an astonishing portrait of humanity in extremis, a work of great wisdom, human empathy, and moral clarity. He follows a remarkable and diverse group of Iraqis over the course of this extraordinary time: from the all-pervasive fear that comes from living under Saddam's brutal, Orwellian rule to the surreal atmosphere of Baghdad before the invasion; to the invasion's commencement and the regime's death spiral down into its terrible endgame; to America's disastrously ill-conceived seizure of power and its fruits. In channeling a tragedy of epic dimensions through the stories of real people caught up in the whirlwind of history, Jon Lee Anderson has written a book of timeless significance.",0316729906,9780316729901),Hardcover,,389 pages,"

","No one was surprised when Aaron Crown was arrested for the decades-old murder of the most famous black civil rights leader in Louisiana. After all, his family were shiftless timber people who brought their ways into the Cajun wetlands--trailing rumors of ties to the Ku Klux Klan. Only Dave Robicheaux, to whom Crown proclaims his innocence, worries that Crown had been made a scapegoat for the collective guilt of a generation.But when Buford LaRose, scion of an old Southern family and author of a book that sent Crown to prison, is elected governor, strange things start to happen. Dave is offered a job as head of the state police; a documentary filmmaker seeking to prove Crown's innocence is killed; and the governor's wife--a former flame--once again turns her seductive powers on Dave. It's clear that Dave must find out the dark truth about Aaron Crown, a truth that too many people want to remain hidden.",0786889187,9780786889181),Paperback,,464 pages,"

","The last few days have been the darkest of Sally’s life. After experiencing the joy of finding her mate, she now suffers the pain of losing everything she holds dear. Both the Romanian and Serbian packs have been captured, ripping Sally’s soul mate away from her almost as soon as she had found him. Her best friend and the emotional glue that usually holds Sally together, Jacque Pierce, lies writhing in a restless coma, having been put down by Desdemona’s dark magic. Jennifer Adams, the unshakable one, has revealed to her friends and her mate that she is pregnant, but the Fates have marked her unborn baby for death. Though she rails against the darkness, deep inside Jen knows that Decebel’s baby must die as payment for her own life, and the knowledge is tearing her soul to pieces. Cypher, King of the Warlocks, has claimed Jacque’s mother as his mate and agreed to help Desdemona open a door that would release a horde of demons from beyond the Veil.  Though her world is crashing down around her, Sally holds out hope. The Great Luna is not sitting idly by. She has commanded the Fey council to call upon the packs—all of them. And though Cypher looks for a way to open the Veil for Desdemona, he struggles to protect Lilly and the wolves at the same time. Peri, the ever-courageous High Fae, and a contingent of the remaining females of the Romanian and Serbian packs, push on through the rough Carpathian Mountains. Though they are bound to the human realm, they continue to search for a way to cross over to the land of the Fey. Meanwhile, in reluctant obedience to the Great Luna, the Fey council sends representatives to the far corners of the globe, meeting with the pack Alphas. The Fey must convince the Alphas of every pack to lay aside their petty territorial squabbles and battles of dominance. If they refuse, both the humans and the supernatural races will fall at Mona’s feet. Sally holds to a shred of hope. Though Vasile, Decebel, and their pack mates endure the torture of the In-Between, living their worst nightmares over and over, Sally holds. Though she knows that it is only a matter of time before their wolves take over, she holds. Sally knows that if the males die, then so too will their mates who have performed the Blood Rites, including her best friends Jen and Jacque. Yet she holds. If the males lose themselves to their wolves and turn feral, so too do their mates. Still she holds. Though Vasile, the strongest Alpha in their history to unite the wolves, is lost beyond the Veil, Sally holds. Though Decebel, the only other wolf besides Vaile strong enough to unite the packs, suffers beyond the Veil, Sally will hold. No one is left to unite their race, and defeat Desdemona. Yet Sally still holds. She holds out hope that the Great Luna will not abandon them, cannot abandon them. Throughout the centuries, the Great Luna has always provided a gypsy healer to the packs, especially in times of great need. Now Sally is that healer. Sally fears what role she has to play in the defeat of Desdemona, but she will play it. Though heaven and hell unite against her, she WILL play it. For too long the supernatural races have lived in separation, warring amongst themselves, allowing trivial power plays and selfish disputes to keep them from uniting. That separation has made them weak. Now, being summoned as a collective force to the same land, will they come? Will they come in numbers greater than have been seen in centuries? Will they destroy each other and save Mona the trouble, or will they finally unite and fight as one?",1483949273,9781483949277),Paperback,,506 pages,"

","Det er jul. Tante Molly har sendt de sædvanlige bløde pakker, og Freddy er på vej i seng, eller det vil sige, han tror han er på vej i seng, for pludselig banker det på ruden. Udenfor står vennerne fra rædselskabinettet og har brug for hjælp. Dracula er ved at forsvinde i glemselens tåger og museumspersonalet overvejer at fjerne hans plads i kabinettet. Da han er den eneste tilbage i slægten og ikke drikker blod (på grund af kviksølvindholdet i menneskerne), finder han ingen grund til at eksistere længere. Tungsindet går dog over, da Freddy foreslår, at de tager til Transsylvanien for at skræmme landsbyen ved foden af Dracula-slægtens hovedborg. Afsted går det, for de har kun én nat. Så skal de være tilbage, ellers vil Freddys forældre jo savne ham.Da de ankommer på ryggen af deres trofaste drage, Nitan, iværksætter de straks deres plan. Med lidt teaterblod skal Dracula gå forbi kroen i byen og hælde lidt i hvert fodspor. Efter at have lavet disse blodspor i Transsylvanien skal en enkelt af personerne så gå ned og sige, at han har set Greven på slottet. Ideen er som sådan meget god, men fra teori til praksis er der et stykke vej. Det viser sig da også hurtigt, at det ikke er så let at skræmme folk, som det var i gamle dage.",Danish,Danish,Paperback,,95 pages,"

The next, she was witnessing the unthinkable: a murder in cold blood, ordered by her father and carried out by her boyfriend. When Emilio pulled the trigger, Valentina disappeared. She made a split-second decision to shed her identity and flee her life of privilege, leaving the glittering parties and sultry nightlife of Miami far behind. She doesn’t know how to explain to herself what she saw. All she knows now is that nothing she believed about her family, her heart, or Emilio’s love, was real. She can change her name and deny her past, but Valentina can’t run from the truth. The lines between right and wrong, and trust and betrayal, will be blurred beyond recognition as she untangles the deceptions of the two men she once loved and races to find her own truth.",English,English,Hardcover,,423 pages,"

","Bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann knows exactly what makes hearts race and pulses pound: peril and passion. No one succeeds more brilliantly at blending these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple with the deepest emotions and the highest risks. And there's no better proof than Hot Target. Like most men of action, Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter never learned how to take a vacation. So when he finds himself facing a month's leave, he offers his services to Troubleshooters Incorporated. Founded by a former SEAL, the private-sector security firm is a major player in the ongoing war against terrorism, known for carrying out covert missions too volatile for official U.S. military action. But the first case Richter takes on is anything but under the radar.High-profile maverick movie producer Jane Mercedes Chadwick hasn't quite completed her newest film, but she's already courting controversy. The World War II epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a real-life hero-and the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups. But despite a relentless campaign of angry E-mails, phone calls, and smear tactics, Chadwick won't be pressured into abandoning the project. Then the harassment turns to death threats.While the FBI appears on the scene, nervous Hollywood associates call in Troubleshooters, and now Chadwick has an army of round-the-clock bodyguards, whether she likes it or not. And she definitely doesn't. But her stubbornness doesn't make FBI agent Jules Cassidy's job any easier. The fiercely independent filmmaker presents yet another emotional obstacle that Cassidy doesn't need-he's already in the midst of a personal tug-of-war with his ex-lover, while fighting a growing attraction to Chadwick's brother.Determined to succeed-and survive-on her own terms, Chadwick will face off with enemies and allies alike. But she doesn't count on the bond she forms with the quiet, capable Cosmo Richter. Yet even as their feelings bring them closer, the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter. And when all hell erupts, desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap them both in the crossfire.From the Hardcover edition.",0345456955,9780345456953),Paperback,,534 pages,"

Karena sejak awal pun aku tak pernah berusaha menghindari kebersamaan kita.Aku akan merindukanmu. Dan aku tahu, mulai hari ini, perasaan ini akan senantiasa menyiksaku. Tapi tak apa, sungguh tak apa.

","Key Features Comparable authors are Jeanne Kalogridis, The Borgia Bride, Anita Diamant, The Red Tent and by Anya Seton. The book has a sumptuous package with a strong appeal for fans of Historical Fiction. Follow up book from Eleanor De Jong was Jezebel-another infamous fallen woman from biblical history. Part of our strategic plan to bolster Avon's historical offering which has so far been hugely successful. About the Book: Delilah Maligned as the courtesan who revealed the mighty Samson's secret for money, Delilah has become synonymous with treachery. But behind the myth is a tale far more tragic? From the moment they met, there was a fire in their relationship, with Samson pitted against Delilah's family. But Samson soon develops an overwhelming passion for Delilah; entranced by her beauty and passionate nature. Meanwhile the Israelites and the Philistines are in a state of constant conflict, with Samson a seemingly unbeatable warrior. The Philistines are desperate to learn the secret behind Samson's power and enrol Delilah as a pawn to bring him down. Driven by misplaced anger, Delilah agrees to use her wiles to discover the secret of his strength. But Delilah finds that Samson is far from the ogre that she had assumed. But a sequence of events have been set in motion which both of them are powerless to stop. The consequences of her mistake have gone down in history and this wonderful novel is as alluring and beguiling as Delilah herself. The perfect treat for fans of Anita Diamant and Helen Dunmore. About the Author: Eleanor De Jong Eleanor de Jong is the daughter of academics and grew up in Europe, America and the UK. She studied history and politics at university, and is now settled in London with her partner.Delilahwas her first novel.",1847562388,9781847562388),Paperback,,377 pages,"

","""Lewis struck me as the most thoroughly converted man I ever met,"" observes Walter Hooper in the preface to this collection of essays by C. S. Lewis. ""His whole vision of life was such that the natural and the supernatural seemed inseparably combined.""It is precisely this pervasive Christianity which is demonstrated in the forty-eight essays comprising God in the Dock. Here Lewis addresses himself both to theological questions and to those which Hooper terms ""semi-theological,"" or ethical. But whether he is discussing ""Evil and God,"" ""Miracles,"" ""The Decline of Religion,"" or ""The Humanitarian Theory of Punishment,"" his insight and observations are thoroughly and profoundly Christian.Drawn from a variety of sources, the essays were designed to meet a variety of needs, and among other accomplishments they serve to illustrate the many different angles from which we are able to view the Christian religion. They range from relatively popular pieces written for newspapers to more learned defenses of the faith which first appeared in The Socratic Digest. Characterized by Lewis's honesty and realism, his insight and conviction, and above all his thoroughgoing commitments to Christianity, these essays make God in the Dock very much a book for our time.",0802808689,9780802808684),Paperback,,346 pages,"

","Throughout history women have caused wars, defied the rules, and brought men to their knees. The famous and the infamous, queens, divorcées, actresses, and outlaws have created a ruckus during their lifetimes-turning heads while making waves. Scandalous Women tells the stories of the risk takers who have flouted convention, beaten the odds, and determined the course of world events.*When Cleopatra (69 BC-30 BC) wasn't bathing in asses' milk, the last pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt and forged an important political alliance with Rome against her enemies-until her dalliance with Marc Antony turned the empire against her. *Emilie du Châtelet (1706-1748), a mathematician, physicist, author, and paramour of one of the greatest minds in France, Voltaire, shocked society with her unorthodox lifestyle and intellectual prowess-and became a leader in the study of theoretical physics in France at a time when the sciences were ruled by men.*Long before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on the bus, Ida B. Wells-Barnett (1862-1928) fought to end discrimination and the terrible crime of lynching and helped found the NAACP, but became known as a difficult woman for her refusal to compromise and was largely lost in the annals of history.*Gertrude Bell (1868-1926) had a passion for archaeology and languages, and left her privileged world behind to become one of the foremost chroniclers of British imperialism in the Middle East, and one of the architects of the modern nation of Iraq.",0399536450,9780399536458),Paperback,,304 pages,"

Two of them, Gay and Len, are a long-married couple and her best friends from college. The third, Wes, was once her lover.Organizing a luncheon at Boston’s esteemed Ritz Carlton—an old favorite of the group’s—the narrator expects the occasion will be an excellent chance to catch up with her friends and enjoy each other’s company. But almost immediately upon arriving at the hotel, she senses things are different, though she can’t quite put her finger on what’s wrong. Even the Ritz has changed, no longer displaying the lion—its trademark symbol of hospitality—on its ashtrays.As the afternoon gives way to evening and as the drinks flow, the past and present intrude upon the festivities and the atmosphere turns somber.

In a series of brilliant chapter-length studies, she examines the most powerful cultures in history--from the ancient empires of Persia and China to the recent global empires of England and the United States--and reveals the reasons behind their success, as well as the roots of their ultimate demise.Chua's analysis uncovers a fascinating historical pattern: while policies of tolerance and assimilation toward conquered peoples are essential for an empire to succeed, the multicultural society that results introduces new tensions and instabilities, threatening to pull the empire apart from within. What this means for the United States' uncertain future is the subject of Chua's provocative and surprising conclusion.",1400077419,9781400077410),Paperback,,432 pages,"

The three Silmarils were jewels created by Fëanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Fëanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.",000752322X,9780007523221),Paperback,,443 pages,"

","Acaso sea 'Crónica de una muerte anunciada' la obra más 'realista' de Gabriel García Márquez, pues se basa en un hecho histórico acontecido en la tierra natal del escritor.Cuando empieza la novela, ya se sabe que los hermanos Vicario van a matar a Santiago Nasar -de hecho ya le han matado- para vengar el honor ultrajado de su hermana Ángela, pero el relato termina precisamente en el momento en que Santiago Nasar muere. El tiempo cíclico, tan utilizado por García Márquez en sus obras, reaparece aquí minuciosamente descompuesto en cada uno de sus momentos, reconstruido prolija y exactamente por el narrador, que va dando cuenta de lo que sucedió mucho tiempo atrás, que avanza y retrocede en su relato y hasta llega mucho tiempo después para contar el destino de los supervivientes. La acción es, a un tiempo, colectiva y personal, clara y ambigua, y atrapa al lector desde un principio, a pesar de que conoce el desenlace de la trama. La dialéctica entre mito y realidad se ve potenciada aquí, una vez más, por una prosa tan cargada de fascinación que los eleva hasta las fronteras de la leyenda.",8306012438,8306012438,,,112 pages,"

","The novel begins shortly after the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Rowan Mayfair, recently married to contractor Michael Curry. Michael, feeling betrayed by Rowan, has sunk into a depression helped along by the useless drugs prescribed to him after his close encounter with death.Along comes the sexually adventurous Mona Mayfair, a precocious teenager and powerful witch and Rowan's cousin sharing lines of descent from Julien. She seduces Michael, causing him to snap out of his stupor and renew his vow to find his wife at all costs. He is now convinced that she hasn't gone willingly.And though it was she who spirited her mutant child Lasher away from the house, she is now a prisoner of the monster she has spawned. His first two attempts at impregnating her are failures ending in miscarriage, but he is successful the third time around. As he accompanies her throughout Europe, Rowan manages to send off DNA samples to colleagues in San Francisco. They discover that Lasher is a completely different species, and that Rowan herself has a genetic abnormality, polyploidy, or 92 chromosomes, which was probably what made Lasher's quasi-supernatural birth at all possible in the first place.The dyad returns to America where Lasher sets out to impregnate other female members of the Mayfair family. All attempts are unsuccessful as the women immediately miscarry and hemorrhage to death. Rowan manages to escape Lasher, and after hitchhiking to Louisiana, she collapses in a field and gives birth to Emaleth, a female Taltos. Rowan's last words to Emaleth are to find Michael, which she sets out to do, thinking that Rowan has died.Rowan is found and is rushed to a nearby hospital where she is diagnosed as being in a state of toxic shock. An emergency hysterectomy is performed to save her life, eliminating all chances of her ever giving birth again. She is taken home to Michael where she remains in a deep coma.Much of the book is set into four sections of ""Julien's Story"" which delineates the life of Julien Mayfair and what he has discovered of the entity known as Lasher.Lasher returns to the house to tell Michael and Aaron his story of his past life. Born to Queen Anne of England, the second wife of Henry VIII, and a man from Donnelaith, Lasher is believed to be a saint known as Ashlar, and is quickly taken away by his father to Donnelaith. His father is the son of the Earl of Donnelaith, and from there he is sent to Italy to become a priest. He returns to Scotland after Elizabeth I takes the throne, and is killed there while performing Christmas Mass by followers of the Protestant reformer John Knox. He knows nothing again until Suzanne calls him back into existence.Michael patiently hears Lasher out, and when his story is complete, Michael wastes no time in killing him and burying him under the great oak in the yard. Soon after, he discovers Emaleth in Rowan's room, feeding her the highly nutritious milk from her breasts. This resuscitates Rowan, but upon seeing Emaleth before her, she panics and screams at Michael to kill her. Michael refuses to, so Rowan grabs a gun and shoots her daughter in the head. Rowan immediately realizes what she's done, and crying for her daughter, insists that she be the one to bury her alongside Lasher under the oak tree there.",English,English,Paperback,,640 pages,"

Selected excerpts of the audiobook ""The 2014 Midterm Elections"" by Byron Goines, are utilized to show the contrasts between the historical Republican Party and today's Republican Party. The Republican Party has changed to a regressive party from its historical roots as a progressive party. Between the two political parties, the 21st Century Republican Party is regressive and the 21st Century Democratic Party is progressive. Do you want progressive party members or regressive party members in the office of President of the United States and in both houses of Congress?

","The companion to the highly emotional, scandalous and USA Today Bestselling love story—LOVE, IN ENGLISH—is finally here! Love, in Spanish is a Love, in English follow-up novel told from Mateo Casalles' POV. While Love, in Spanish touches on some events that happened in LIE (you know the ones!) it is a whole new story set a year later that continues with Vera and Mateo's ""happily ever after."" Note: It should be read after Love, in English and it is mostly new material (aka not just rehash of LIE). *** ""She sat beside me on the bus—and she changed my whole life."" Successful, wealthy and absurdly handsome—Spanish ex-football player Mateo Casalles seemed like he had it all. A high-society wife, an adorable little girl, and flashy apartments in Madrid and Barcelona only sweetened the deal. But there was more to Mateo than met the eye – a life of uncertainty and regret that colored his black and white world. That was until Vera Miles came into his life like a shooting star. Tattooed, wild and young, Vera seemed like Mateo’s polar opposite at first. But you can’t choose who you fall in love with and the two lost souls did everything they could to be together, all while suffering the grave consequences. Now with Mateo divorced and living in Madrid with Vera, there is a whole new set of challenges and setbacks facing the couple and rocking the foundation of their star-crossed relationship. Unfortunately for them, the brighter the star, the faster they burn. ***Love, in Spanish contains the first two chapters of Where Sea Meets Sky, a full-length Love, in English spin-off starring Vera's brother, Josh Miles, coming March 2015 from Atria Books***",English,English,ebook,,154 pages,"

","Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist is now a major television series on FOX. It remains one of the most controversial novels ever written and went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying.Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark.Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",006209436X,9780062094360),Paperback,40th Anniversary Edition,400 pages,"

","Hemingway's classic novel of the Spanish Civil War. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war; three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from ""the good fight,"" For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. Surpassing his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, Hemingway creates a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving and wise. ""If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,"" Maxwell Perkins wrote to Hemingway after reading the manuscript, ""no one ever so completely performed it."" For Whom the Bell Tolls stands as one of the best war novels of all time.  Ernest Hemingway did more to change the style of English prose than any other writer in the twentieth century, and for his efforts he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954. Hemingway wrote in short, declarative sentences and was known for his tough, terse prose. Publication of The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms immediately established Ernest Hemingway as one of the greatest literary lights of the twentieth century. As part of the expatriate community in 1920s Paris, the former journalist and World War I ambulance driver began a career that lead to international fame. Hemingway was an aficionado of bullfighting and big-game hunting, and his main protagonists were always men and women of courage and conviction, who suffered unseen scars, both physical and emotional. He covered the Spanish Civil War, portraying it in fiction in his brilliant novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, and he subsequently covered World War II. His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. He died in 1961.",0684830485,9780684830483),Hardcover,,496 pages,"

","Months later, the king returned home and presented his astonished queen with not one, but nine baby girls. “One from each kingdom I visited,” said the king. “They are orphans.” The queen wept joyously at the row of cradles, each bearing a sleeping infant. After bestowing a kiss on each child’s forehead she said, “Now they are princesses.”Book 1: Maelyn was not born a princess. The king found her as a child, the lone survivor of a poor village slaughtered by the Red Fever. Suddenly she became a princess of Runa Realm, the first of nine orphans adopted by the king.By her eighteenth year, Maelyn rules over Runa and a family of nine sisters. But some call the princesses frauds and imposters, a handful of urchins raised into royalty. Even Uncle Jarrod, the High King of Grunwold, seems determined to prove that Maelyn no longer deserves to be a princess. With a family losing faith in her, and a kingdom growing dangerously hostile, even Maelyn begins to wonder if she is truly a real princess. And if her riches will turn to rags once again….The Nine Princesses Novellas is a series that chronicles the adventures of an unconventional family of princesses, the struggles they face in a kingdom often hostile to their humble origins, and the day-to-day dramas of nine young women whose personalities often clash like swords.

","WINNER OF THE 2013 UTOPYA AWARDS FOR BEST VILLAIN & BEST BOOK COVER OF THE YEARCold, fine drops of rain fall softly on my cheeks as I emerge from the darkness of the ship’s interior to the gray, overcast sky of the main deck. Pulling my dark pea coat tighter to my body, the wind lifts red tendrils of my hair. I walk slowly to the railing overlooking the water. I catch my first sight of the Irish coastline; its craggy landscape makes me shiver in dread. I find it difficult to imagine now how the Gancanagh had made this their home for so long without anyone realizing it. The cold, moss-covered edifices practically scream their presence. As I study the shadows between the falling-down stone, I imagine creeping shapes of undead Faeries grasping the rock, waiting for our ship to draw nearer to their position. Tipping my face up, I let the rain wash over me. It bathes away the frigid sweat of fear that has broken on my brow. “You don’t know how fiercely beautiful you are, do you?” A quiet voice behind me asks, causing me to stiffen and fix my eyes on the rocks along the shoreline.",B00AI5F6C4,B00AI5F6C4,Kindle Edition,,461 pages,"

","Was gibt es Besseres beim Lesen, als einer literarischen Figur ganz nah zu sein? In ihre Haut zu schlüpfen, sie ganz und gar zu verstehen; das denken, was sie denkt, das fühlen, was sie fühlt. Eins werden mit der Person. Arthur Schnitzler war einer der ersten, denen mit der Technik des inneren Monologs genau dies gelang. Zuerst in Leutnant Gustl 1900, dann in Fräulein Else 1924. Zwei sehr unterschiedliche Figuren werden hier dargestellt, mit zwei völlig verschiedenen Lebens- und Gefühlswelten. Der junge Offizier, der von einem nicht satisfaktionsfähigen Bäckermeister beleidigt wird und sich deshalb, obwohl niemand den Vorfall mitbekommen hat, nach dem Ehrenkodex der Armee erschießen müßte, durchleidet eine Nacht der Todesangst -- bis er morgens erfährt, daß jener Bäckermeister einem Schlaganfall erlegen ist. Dann die junge Anwaltstochter Else, die von ihrer Mutter gebeten wird, den Vater aus einer Schuldenmisere zu befreien und einen befreundeten Kunsthändler um das Geld zu bitten; als dieser seine finanzielle Hilfe aber unter die Bedingung stellt, Else nackt sehen zu dürfen, verzweifelt sie an den moralischen Konflikten, entblößt sich im Musikzimmer des Hotels und nimmt eine Überdosis Veronal. Das Lesen der beiden Novellen ist wie ein Sog. Man wird immer weiter hineingezogen in die Seelenzustände von Gustl und Else, in ihre Verwirrung, Assoziationen, Erinnerungen. Und man leidet mit ihnen in diesen extremen Grenzsituationen. Am Ende findet man nur schwer zurück in die eigene Welt. Denn das Ich der Personen macht Schnitzler so erlebbar und plastisch, wie kaum ein anderer deutschsprachiger Erzähler dies vermochte. --Lilli Belek",3150181550,9783150181553),Taschenbuch,,107 pages,"

","""Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı yazmaya başladığımda, çocukluğumda beni etkilemiş olan her şeyi edebiyat aracılığıyla aktarabileceğim bir yol bulmak istiyordum. Çok kasvetli kocaman bir evde, toprak yiyen bir kız kardeş, geleceği sezen bir büyükanne ve mutlulukla çılgınlık arasında ayrım gözetmeyen, adları bir örnek bir yığın hısım akraba arasında geçen çocukluk günlerimi sanatsal bir dille ardımda bırakmaktı amacım. Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı iki yıldan daha kısa bir sürede yazdım, ama yazı makinemin başına oturmadan önce bu kitap hakkında düşünmek on beş, on altı yılımı aldı. Büyükannem, en acımasız şeyleri, kılını bile kıpırdatmadan, sanki yalnızca gördüğü olağan şeylermiş gibi anlatırdı bana. Anlattığı öyküleri bu kadar değerli kılan şeyin, onun duygusuz tavrı ve imgelerindeki zenginlik olduğunu kavradım. Yüzyıllık Yalnızlık'ı büyükannemin işte bu yöntemini kullanarak yazdım. Bu romanı dikkat ve keyifle okuyan, hiç şaşırmayan sıradan insanlar tanıdım. Şaşırmadılar, çünkü ben onlara hayatlarında yeni olan bir şey anlatmamıştım, kitabımda gerçekliğe dayanmayan tek cümle bulamazsınız.""(Tanıtım Bülteninden)",Turkish,Turkish,Paperback,,464 pages,"

","CHICKEN DISEASES:Identification And Management Of Stress, Vices, And Diseases In Chickens  A chicken is regarded to be in a state of good health when all its body organs and systems are normal and perfectly functioning. Any alteration in the state of its body, or of any of its organs, which interferes with the proper performance of its functions, is what is regarded as a disease.  Naturally, chickens are flock animals, therefore, have the potential to fast spread, any contaminated disease amongst themselves. While on the contrary, it is a dream of every chicken keeper to want to raise healthy and disease free flock. The benefits of doing so can never be over emphasized.  Some of the invaluable topics covered herein includes:  *Signs exhibited by sick chickens. *Stress in chickens (Causes and Control). *Vices in Chickens (Causes and Control). *Predisposing factors to chicken diseases. *The most common chicken diseases. *How to effectively deal with chicken diseases.

","This is the third volume of the History of Middle-earth, which comprises here-tofore unpublished manuscripts that were written over a period of many years before Tolkien's Simlarillion was published. Volumes 1 and 2 were the Book of Lost Tales, Part One and The Book of Lost Tales, Part Two. Together, these volumes encompass an extraordinarily extensive body of material ornamenting and buttressing what must be the most fully realized world ever to spring from a single author's imagination.""I write alliterative verse with pleasure,"" wrote J.R.R. Tolkien in 1955, ""though I have published little beyond the fragments in The Lord of the Rings, except The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth."" The first of the poems in The Lays of Beleriand is the previously unpublished Lay of the Children of Hurin, his early but most sustained work in the ancient English meter, intended to narrate on a grand scale the tragedy of Turin Turambar. It was account of the killing by Turin of his friend Beleg, as well as a unique description of the great redoubt of Nargothrond. The Lay of the Children of Hurin was supplanted by the Lay of Leithian, ""Release from Bondage"", in which another major legend of the Elder Days received poetic form, in this case in rhyme. The chief source of the short prose tale of Beren and Luthien is The Silmarillion. This, too, was not completed, but the whole Quest of the Silmaril is told, and the poem breaks off only after the encounter with Morgoth in his subterranean fortress. Many years later, when The Lord of the rings was finished, J.R.R. Tolkien returned to the Lay of Leithian and started on a new version, which is also given in this book.Accompanying the poems are commentaries on the evolution of the history of the Elder Days, which was much developed during the years of the composition of the two Lays. Also included is the notable criticism in detail of the Lay of Lethian by C.S. Lewis, Tolkien's friend and colleague, who read the poem in 1929. By assuming that this poem is actually a fragment from a past lost in history, Lewis underlined the remarkable power of its author's imaginative talents and academic competence.",0395394295,9780395394298),Hardcover,First US Edition,393 pages,"

","'If you look at all the people involved - Ivo, Tony Wilson, McGee, Geoff Travis, myself - nobody had a clue about running a record company, and that was the best thing about it.' - Daniel Miller, Mute RecordsRichard King's How Soon Is Now? is a landmark survey of the record labels that make up the backbone of the independent music industry and the hugely inspirational, eccentric, impulsive and visionary figures who created them.One of the most tangible aftershocks of punk was its urgency to prompt individuals into action. Document your reality: do it yourself. From this, a generation was inspired and, with often zero financial planning or business sense, in bedrooms, garages and sheds, labels such as Factory, Rough Trade, Mute, 4AD, Beggars Banquet, Warp, Creation and Domino began, shifting the musical landscape and trading on an ethos and identity no brand consultant would now dare dream of. Musicians were encouraged to do whatever the hell they wanted and damn the consequences. From humble beginnings, some of our most influential artists were allowed to thrive: Orange Juice, New Order, Cocteau Twins, Depeche Mode, Happy Mondays, The Smiths, Sonic Youth, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Teenage Fanclub, Broadcast, The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, and Arctic Monkeys, to name but a handful. This is the story, set to an incredible soundtrack, of the enormous scale of the passions, the size of the egos, and the true extent of the madness of the mavericks who had the vision and bloody-mindedness to turn the music world on its head.",0571243908,9780571243907),Paperback,,624 pages,"

","A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. An achingly tender story about the enduring power of love.A man with a faded, well-worn notebook open in his lap. A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. ""I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough."" And so begins one of the most poignant and compelling love stories you will ever read...The Notebook",English,English,,,239 pages,"

And she can protect herself by refusing to let anyone else get close to her.High school quarterback and town golden boy Brady used to be the best of friends with Willa—she even had a crush on him when they were kids. But that’s all changed now: her life choices have made her a different person from the girl he used to know.Gunner used to be friends with Willa and Brady, too. He too is larger than life and a high school football star—not to mention that his family basically owns the town of Lawton. He loves his life, and doesn’t care about anyone except himself. But Willa is the exception—and he understands the girl she’s become in a way no one else can.As secrets come to light and hearts are broken, these former childhood friends must face the truth about growing up and falling in love…even if it means losing each other forever.",B013PJVKCO,B013PJVKCO,Kindle Edition,,320 pages,"

Moving in the spiritual realm should be as much a part of a believer's routine as prayer, worship and reading Scripture. Yet all too often, Christians practice an intellectual faith, which lacks any supernatural punch. Healing, deliverance and signs and wonders are an inheritance for all followers of Jesus Christ. The Supernatural Power of a Transformed Mind teaches you how to remove the blinders of religious limitation to redeem the lost and transform communities. You too can tap into an abundance of miracle-working authority and unleash the power of God's glory.

","Under the Big Black Sun explores the nascent Los Angeles punk rock movement and its evolution to hardcore punk as it’s never been told before. Authors John Doe and Tom DeSavia have woven together an enthralling story of the legendary west coast scene from 1977-1982 by enlisting the voices of people who were there. The book shares chapter-length tales from the authors along with personal essays from famous (and infamous) players in the scene. Additional authors include: Exene Cervenka (X), Henry Rollins (Black Flag), Mike Watt (The Minutemen), Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey (The Go-Go’s), Dave Alvin (The Blasters), Jack Grisham (TSOL), Teresa Covarrubias (The Brat), Robert Lopez (The Zeros, El Vez), as well as scencesters and journalists Pleasant Gehman, Kristine McKenna, and Chris Morris. Through interstitial commentary, John Doe “narrates” this journey through the land of film noir sunshine, Hollywood back alleys, and suburban sprawl—the place where he met his artistic counterparts Exene, DJ Bonebrake, and Billy Zoom—and formed X, the band that became synonymous with, and in many ways defined, L.A. punk.Under the Big Black Sun shares stories of friendship and love, ambition and feuds, grandiose dreams and cultural rage, all combined with the tattered, glossy sheen of pop culture weirdness that epitomized the operations of Hollywood’s underbelly. Readers will travel to the clubs that defined the scene, as well as to the street corners, empty lots, apartment complexes, and squats that served as de facto salons for the musicians, artists, and fringe players that hashed out what would become punk rock in Los Angeles.",English,English,Hardcover,,277 pages,"

","In northern Iceland, 1829, Agnes Magnusdottir is condemned to death for her part in the brutal murder of two men.Agnes is sent to wait out the time leading to her execution on the farm of District Officer Jon Jonsson, his wife and their two daughters. Horrified to have a convicted murderess in their midst, the family avoids speaking with Agnes. Only Toti, the young assistant reverend appointed as Agnes' spiritual guardian, is compelled to try to understand her, as he attempts to salvage her soul. As the summer months fall away to winter and the hardships of rural life force the household to work side by side, Agnes' ill-fated tale of longing and betrayal begins to emerge. And as the days to her execution draw closer, the question burns: did she or didn't she?Based on a true story, Burial Rites is a deeply moving novel about personal freedom: who we are seen to be versus who we believe ourselves to be, and the ways in which we will risk everything for love. In beautiful, cut-glass prose, Hannah Kent portrays Iceland's formidable landscape, where every day is a battle for survival, and asks, how can one woman hope to endure when her life depends upon the stories told by others?",1742612822,9781742612829),Paperback,,353 pages,"

","Winner of the 2011 Man Booker PrizeBy an acclaimed writer at the height of his powers, The Sense of an Ending extends a streak of extraordinary books that began with the best-selling Arthur & George and continued with Nothing to Be Frightened Of and, most recently, Pulse.   This intense new novel follows a middle-aged man as he contends with a past he has never much thought about—until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance, one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony Webster thought he’d left all this behind as he built a life for himself, and by now his marriage and family and career have fallen into an amicable divorce and retirement. But he is then presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he’d understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.    A novel so compelling that it begs to be read in a single sitting, with stunning psychological and emotional depth and sophistication, The Sense of an Ending is a brilliant new chapter in Julian Barnes’s oeuvre. --publisher's description",0307957330,9780307957337),ebook,Borzoi Edition,107 pages,"

","Nevil Shute’s most powerful novel—a bestseller for decades after its 1957 publication—is an unforgettable vision of a post-apocalyptic world.After a nuclear World War III has destroyed most of the globe, the few remaining survivors in southern Australia await the radioactive cloud that is heading their way and bringing certain death to everyone in its path. Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. Both terrifying and intensely moving, On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.",0307473996,9780307473998),Paperback,,312 pages,"

","A searing and profound Southern odyssey by National Book Award–winner Jesmyn Ward.In Jesmyn Ward’s first novel since her National Book Award–winning Salvage the Bones, this singular American writer brings the archetypal road novel into rural twenty-first-century America. Drawing on Morrison and Faulkner, The Odyssey and the Old Testament, Ward gives us an epochal story, a journey through Mississippi’s past and present that is both an intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle. Ward is a major American writer, multiply awarded and universally lauded, and in Sing, Unburied, Sing she is at the height of her powers. Jojo and his toddler sister, Kayla, live with their grandparents, Mam and Pop, and the occasional presence of their drug-addicted mother, Leonie, on a farm on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Leonie is simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she’s high; Mam is dying of cancer; and quiet, steady Pop tries to run the household and teach Jojo how to be a man. When the white father of Leonie’s children is released from prison, she packs her kids and a friend into her car and sets out across the state for Parchman farm, the Mississippi State Penitentiary, on a journey rife with danger and promise. Sing, Unburied, Sing grapples with the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power, and limitations, of the bonds of family. Rich with Ward’s distinctive, musical language, Sing, Unburied, Sing is a majestic new work and an essential contribution to American literature.",B01M9I7CRC,B01M9I7CRC,Kindle Edition,,305 pages,"

A far-right extremist is killed in a remote cabin in the Pacific Northwest. A wealthy businessman is murdered in Thailand. A pimp in Brooklyn is found stabbed to death and mysteriously covered by a brown shroud.

Desperate to find the link between the killings and to save his wife, he enlists his college sweetheart, TC, an eccentric artist and Kabbalah expert.

","Tessa Russo is the mother of two young children and the wife of a renowned pediatric surgeon. Despite her own mother's warnings, Tessa has recently given up her career to focus on her family and the pursuit of domestic happiness. From the outside, she seems destined to live a charmed life. Valerie Anderson is an attorney and single mother to six-year-old Charlie—a boy who has never known his father. After too many disappointments, she has given up on romance—and even to some degree, friendships—believing that it is always safer not to expect too much.Although both women live in the same Boston suburb, the two have relatively little in common aside from a fierce love for their children.  But one night, a tragic accident causes their lives to converge in ways no one could have imagined.  In alternating, pitch-perfect points of view, Emily Giffin creates a moving, luminous story of good people caught in untenable circumstances. Each being tested in ways they never thought possible. Each questioning everything they once believed. And each ultimately discovering what truly matters most.",0312554168,9780312554163),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Quasi nulla piace ai lettori di Mordecai Richler quanto addentrarsi nell'albero genealogico di Barney Panofsky, sperando prima o poi di imbattersi nel vero progenitore romanzesco di uno dei personaggi più amati degli ultimi anni. Bene, con questo libro del 1980 la singolare caccia all'uomo iniziata, in Italia, tredici anni fa può considerarsi conclusa. Entra Joshua Shapiro, scrittore e giornalista di successo ricoverato in ospedale dopo la misteriosa sparizione dell’amatissima moglie, e dopo essere stato coinvolto in un clamoroso scandalo di natura sessuale. Nello stato confusionale in cui si trova, Joshua non è in grado di dire quale delle innumerevoli voci che circolano sul suo conto sia fondata, e quale invece debba considerarsi una calunnia. Per riuscirci, dovrà infatti andare molto indietro nel tempo, fino a un'infanzia affidata in parti uguali alla madre, nota nella zona di St. Urbain Street per i suoi spogliarelli, e al padre, un pugile a riposo e furfante in attività, molto ansioso di trasmettere al figlio i segreti del suo (secondo) mestiere. Cominciando dall'inizio – attraverso gli anni, le donne, gli amici, e la solita, incontenibile frenesia vitale – Joshua riuscirà, a modo suo, a comporre il rompicapo. Sarà una ricerca movimentata e molto lunga, per lui: ma per il lettore, come sempre e anche di più, persino troppo breve.",884592825X,9788845928253),Hardcover,Fabula,466 pages,"

","A true story of love, murder, and the end of the world's ""great hush.""In Thunderstruck, Erik Larson tells the interwoven stories of two men--Hawley Crippen, a very unlikely murderer, and Guglielmo Marconi, the obsessive creator of a seemingly supernatural means of communication--whose lives intersect during one of the greatest criminal chases of all time.Set in Edwardian London and on the stormy coasts of Cornwall, Cape Cod, and Nova Scotia, Thunderstruck evokes the dynamism of those years when great shipping companies competed to build the biggest, fastest ocean liners; scientific advances dazzled the public with visions of a world transformed; and the rich outdid one another with ostentatious displays of wealth. Against this background, Marconi races against incredible odds and relentless skepticism to perfect his invention: the wireless, a prime catalyst for the emergence of the world we know today. Meanwhile, Crippen, ""the kindest of men,"" nearly commits the perfect murder.With his unparalleled narrative skills, Erik Larson guides us through a relentlessly suspenseful chase over the waters of the North Atlantic. Along the way, he tells of a sad and tragic love affair that was described on the front pages of newspapers around the world, a chief inspector who found himself strangely sympathetic to the killer and his lover, and a driven and compelling inventor who transformed the way we communicate.",1400080673,9781400080670),Paperback,,392 pages,"

","All-girl camp. First love. First heartbreak. At once romantic and devastating, brutally honest and full of humor, this graphic-novel memoir is a debut of the rarest sort.Maggie Thrash has spent basically every summer of her fifteen-year-old life at the one-hundred-year-old Camp Bellflower for Girls, set deep in the heart of Appalachia. She’s from Atlanta, she’s never kissed a guy, she’s into Backstreet Boys in a really deep way, and her long summer days are full of a pleasant, peaceful nothing . . . until one confounding moment. A split-second of innocent physical contact pulls Maggie into a gut-twisting love for an older, wiser, and most surprising of all (at least to Maggie), female counselor named Erin. But Camp Bellflower is an impossible place for a girl to fall in love with another girl, and Maggie’s savant-like proficiency at the camp’s rifle range is the only thing keeping her heart from exploding. When it seems as if Erin maybe feels the same way about Maggie, it’s too much for both Maggie and Camp Bellflower to handle, let alone to understand.",076367382X,9780763673826),Hardcover,,267 pages,"

","Your toddler throws a tantrum in the middle of a store. Your preschooler refuses to get dressed. Your fifth-grader sulks on the bench instead of playing on the field. Do children conspire to make their parents’ lives endlessly challenging? No—it’s just their developing brain calling the shots!In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson demystify the meltdowns and aggravation, explaining the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids can seem—and feel—so out of control. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth. Raise calmer, happier children using twelve key strategies, including • Name It to Tame It: Corral raging right-brain behavior through left-brain storytelling, appealing to the left brain’s affinity for words and reasoning to calm emotional storms and bodily tension.• Engage, Don’t Enrage: Keep your child thinking and listening, instead of purely reacting.• Move It or Lose It: Use physical activities to shift your child’s emotional state.• Let the Clouds of Emotion Roll By: Guide your children when they are stuck on a negative emotion, and help them understand that feelings come and go.• SIFT: Help children pay attention to the Sensations, Images, Feelings, and Thoughts within them so that they can make better decisions and be more flexible.• Connect Through Conflict: Use discord to encourage empathy and greater social success. Complete with clear explanations, age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles, and illustrations that will help you explain these concepts to your child, The Whole-Brain Child shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.",English,English,Hardcover,,192 pages,"

","In the shadows of World War II, trust becomes the greatest risk of all for two strangers.December 1943. In the years before the rise of Hitler, the Gerber family’s summer cottage was filled with laughter. Now, as deep drifts of snow blanket the Black Forest, German dissenter Franka Gerber is alone and hopeless. Fervor and brutality have swept through her homeland, taking away both her father and her brother and leaving her with no reason to live.That is, until she discovers an unconscious airman lying in the snow wearing a Luftwaffe uniform, his parachute flapping in the wind. Unwilling to let him die, Franka takes him to her family’s isolated cabin despite her hatred for the regime he represents. But when it turns out that he is not who he seems, Franka begins a race against time to unravel the mystery of the airman’s true identity. Their tenuous bond becomes as inseparable as it is dangerous. Hunted by the Gestapo, can they trust each other enough to join forces on a mission that could change the face of the war and their own lives forever?",1503954056,9781503954052),Paperback,,270 pages,"

","Reine d'Ecosse à l'âge de six jours, en 1542, puis reine de France à dix-sept ans par son mariage avec François II, Marie Stuart est un des personnages les plus romanesques de l'histoire. Veuve en 1560, elle rentre en Ecosse et épouse lord Darnley. Déçue par ce mariage, elle devient la maîtresse du comte de Bothwell. Lorsque ce dernier assassine Darnley, l'horreur est telle qu'elle doit se réfugier auprès de sa rivale, Elisabeth 1re reine d'Angleterre. Celle-ci la retiendra vingt ans captive, avant de la faire condamner à mort. Son courage devant le supplice impressionnera les témoins, au point de métamorphoser celle que l'on disait une criminelle en une martyre de la foi catholique... Sur cette figure fascinante et controversée de l'histoire britannique, le biographe de Marie-Antoinette et romancier de Vingt-quatre heures de la vie d'une femme a mené une enquête rigoureuse, se livrant à une critique serrée des documents et des témoignages. Ce récit passionné nous la restitue avec ses ombres et ses lumières, ses faiblesses et sa grandeur.",2253150797,9782253150794),Mass Market Paperback,,413 pages,"

","„Adevărul este că, pentru oamenii epocii victoriene, personajele lui Hardy puteau să pară adevăraţi monştri. În realitate, existenţa lor este, de cele mai multe ori, banală. Sunt oameni oarecare, cu defecte obişnuite: pot fi beţivi, egoişti, violenţi, pot fi ingraţi cu cei care îi iubesc sau, dimpotrivă, să le atribuie însuşiri nemaiîntâlnite celor de care sunt îndrăgostiţi. Dragostea lor e însă nimicitoare: ea îi mistuie deopotrivă pe cel care o nutreşte şi pe obiectul dragostei lui, încheindu-se totdeauna cu moarte sau nebunie.Nici cei care o refuză nu se pot salva. Un vânt blestemat suflă peste oamenii cărţilor lui Thomas Hardy: toţi devin victime ale patimii şi, căutându-şi izbăvirea, se pierd în întinderile landei Egdon. Poate însă că marea lor infirmitate e lipsa marilor visuri. Singura excepţie, în această privinţă, e Tess.” – DAN GRIGORESCU„Locul de frunte pe care Thomas Hardy îl deţine printre scriitorii literaturii engleze moderne este unul binemeritat, iar sensul ultim al scrierilor lui ne face mai conştienţi de natura noastră umană.” – RICHARD C.

Tempe determines the bones are from different corpses, suggesting a serial killer's handiwork. A suspect is quickly taken into custody, but Tempe senses the case is far from closed.

","She has been hailed by Michael Chabon as “the most darkly playful voice in American fiction” and by Neil Gaiman as “a national treasure.” Now Kelly Link’s eagerly awaited new collection--her first for adult readers in a decade--proves indelibly that this bewitchingly original writer is among the finest we have. Link has won an ardent following for her ability to take readers deep into an unforgettable, brilliantly constructed fictional universe with each new story. In “The Summer People,” a young girl in rural North Carolina serves as uneasy caretaker to the mysterious, never-quite-glimpsed visitors who inhabit the cottage behind her house. In “I Can See Right Through You,” a middle-aged movie star makes a disturbing trip to the Florida swamp where his former on- and off-screen love interest is shooting a ghost-hunting reality show. In “The New Boyfriend,” a suburban slumber party takes an unusual turn, and a teenage friendship is tested, when the spoiled birthday girl opens her big present: a life-size animated doll. Hurricanes, astronauts, evil twins, bootleggers, Ouija boards, iguanas, The Wizard of Oz, superheroes, the Pyramids...These are just some of the talismans of an imagination as capacious and as full of wonder as that of any writer today. But as fantastical as these stories can be, they are always grounded in sly humor and an innate generosity of feeling for the frailty--and the hidden strengths--of human beings. In Get in Trouble, this one-of-a-kind talent expands the boundaries of what short fiction can do.",0804179689,9780804179683),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Étienne si è finalmente innamorato, proprio di lei. Dopo tante delusioni, il vero amore sembra essere arrivato e Rebecca è pronta a trasferirsi a Parigi per raggiungere l’uomo della sua vita. La aspettano una lussuosa casa, un entusiasmante lavoro come wedding planner e un’eccitante convivenza. Fasciata nei suoi impeccabili tubini, in bilico sui tacchi a spillo, la moderna Coco, ormai sicura di sé e follemente innamorata, è pronta ad affrontare il futuro radioso che la attende. Ma cosa succede se all’improvviso, quando tutto sembra filare liscio, un ingombrante passato si riaffaccia nella vita di Étienne? E se quel passato, per giunta, ha le sembianze di una ragazza bruna che indossa una taglia 38, è elegante e ha l’aria da attrice francese di cinema muto? Come se non bastasse, Coco si trova anche alle prese con un insistente e bellissimo corteggiatore e con un padre che dopo anni cerca di riconquistare il suo affetto. Tra soste in pasticcerie che profumano di croissant, brindisi in suggestivi bistrot in compagnia di Élodie e chiacchiere con gli amici fidati, ancora una volta Coco proverà a realizzare il suo sogno d’amore. Perché niente e nessuno potrà convincerla del contrario: il vero lieto fine deve essere per sempre.",8854152560,9788854152564),Hardcover,Anagramma #200,351 pages,"

","Топла майска нощ през 1993 г. Обсадата на Сараево е започнала преди година и краят не се вижда, също както на братоубийствената война между довчерашните съюзни югославски народи. Двойка млади сърби стоят в кухнята си, потънали в мълчание. Давор, християнин, и Айда, мюсюлманка, са съхранили любовта си сред разрухата и безумието, които царят в обсадения град. Знаят, че наближава поредното кратко, едва половинчасово затишие, когато снайперистите почиват. Загледани в стрелките на часовника, те са взели решението да избягат – да достигнат свободата… или да посрещнат смъртта.Двадесет години по-късно българин пътува към Сараево, за да се срещне със сръбския преводач на книгата си. Скоро се озовават в кръчма и неусетно заговарят за войната. С напредването на часовете празните бутилки на масата се увеличават, а отдавна погребани тайни излизат на повърхността.Две нощи.

","A journey through the otherworldly science behind Christopher Nolan’s highly anticipated film, Interstellar, from executive producer and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne.Interstellar, from acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan, takes us on a fantastic voyage far beyond our solar system. Yet in The Science of Interstellar, Kip Thorne, the physicist who assisted Nolan on the scientific aspects of Interstellar, shows us that the movie’s jaw-dropping events and stunning, never-before-attempted visuals are grounded in real science. Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, Thorne’s scientific insights—many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of Interstellar—describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible.Interstellar and all related characters and elements are trademarks of and © Warner Bros.

","Com dezasseis anos, Cinder é considerada pela sociedade como um erro tecnológico. Para a madrasta, é um fardo. No entanto, ser cyborg também tem algumas vantagens: as suas ligações cerebrais conferem-lhe uma prodigiosa capacidade para reparar aparelhos (autómatos, planadores, as suas partes defeituosas) e fazem dela a melhor especialista em mecânica de Nova Pequim. É esta reputação que leva o príncipe Kai a abordá-la na oficina onde trabalha, para que lhe repare um andróide antes do baile anual. Em tom de gracejo, o príncipe diz tratar-se de «um caso de segurança nacional», mas Cinder desconfia que o assunto é mais sério do que dá a entender. Ansiosa por impressionar o príncipe, as intenções de Cinder são transtornadas quando a irmã mais nova, e sua única amiga humana, é contagiada pela peste fatal que há uma década devasta a Terra. A madrasta de Cinder atribui-lhe a culpa da doença da filha e oferece o corpo da enteada como cobaia para as investigações clínicas relacionadas com a praga, uma «honra» à qual ninguém até então sobreviveu. Mas os cientistas não tardam a descobrir que a nova cobaia apresenta características que a tornam única.

","A sharply intelligent novel about two college students and the strange, unexpected connection they forge with a married couple.Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.Written with gem-like precision and probing intelligence, Conversations With Friends is wonderfully alive to the pleasures and dangers of youth.""",B01M6XMA62,B01M6XMA62,Kindle Edition,,304 pages,"

While Yuzuki certainly feels like a sister to Minoru, the more time he spends with her, the more he loves her for who she is. Chi was also built as a substitute family member. Back then she was known as Elda, and she and her ""sister"" Freya were built to be the daughters of their creator and his wife.

","In this enchanting version of the story of King Arthur, the renowned American illustrator and storyteller Howard Pyle displays his unique talent for capturing and stimulating the imaginations of the young. Inventively retold and vividly illustrated, these stories describe the perilous and thrilling adventures of King Arthur and his knights in that glorious age of chivalry and honor. After showing how Arthur established his right to the throne by drawing the sword from the anvil, the author then relates the story of Arthur's battle with the Sable Knight and his securing the sword Excalibur ― ""the most beautiful and the most famous sword in all the world."" He tells of Arthur's confrontations with the Duke of North Umber and Sir Pellias, describes King Arthur's wooing and wedding the Lady Guinevere, and tells of the establishment of the Round Table. Tales are told, too, of Arthur's knights, including Merlin the Wise, Sir Pellias (or the Gentle Knight) and of course, Sir Gawaine. One of the key points in the book is Arthur's search for the answer to the riddle ""What is it that a woman most desires?"" with his life at stake. This is the definitive children's version of the Arthurian legend, for generations a special favorite with youngsters of all ages. Its reputation, richly deserved, rests as much upon the illustrations as on the delightful tales themselves. And no wonder, for as an illustrator of children's books, Pyle had no peer. Bold and unforgettable as only Pyle's skilled hand could make them, these drawings convey at a glance the whole aura of that splendid age and help to make this a book that boys and girls will cherish for years to come. These stories have inspired numerous film adaptations, including the 2017 release King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou, and Annabelle Wallis.",0486214451,9780486214450),Paperback,,336 pages,"

Seierstad traveled extensively through Serbia between 1999 and 2004, following the lives of people from across the political spectrum. Her moving and perceptive account follows nationalists, Titoists, Yugonostalgics, rock stars, fugitives, and poets.

And, in the middle of it all, little Jimmy Hardcastle has, in the fountain of a suburban mall, walked on water.

There’s safety in silence. Francine would rather lose herself in a book, or in daydreams about her favorite Hollywood stars, than risk attracting attention or getting in trouble.But when outspoken, passionate Sophie Bowman transfers into Francine’s class at All Saints School for Girls, Francine finds herself thinking about things that never concerned her before: free speech, the atom bomb, the existence of God, the way people treat each other. Eventually, Francine discovers that she not only has something to say, she is absolutely determined to say it.Once again, Karen Cushman follows a young woman’s progress toward her true self, this time exploring the nature of friendship and the experience of growing up Catholic in an era that is both fascinating and relevant to today’s young people.

","Doc Ford returns to his stilt house on Dinkin's Bay to find an old friend and one-time lover waiting for him. Her real-estate developer husband has disappeared and been pronounced dead, and she's sure there's worse to follow-and she's right. Following the trail, Ford ends up deep in the Everglades, at the gates of a community presided over by a man named Bhagwan Shiva (formerly Jerry Singh). Shiva is big business, but that business has been a little shaky lately, and so he's come up with a scheme to enhance both his cash and his power. Of course, there's the possibility that some people could get hurt and the Everglades itself damaged, but Shiva smells a killing. And if that should turn out to be literally, as well as figuratively, true...well, that's just too damned bad.Replete with passion and rich, pungent prose and some of the best suspense characters anywhere in fiction, Everglades is the finest work yet from an extraordinary talent.",0425196860,9780425196861),Paperback,,384 pages,"

","The fire burned hot and red in the pit, and Saphyre's eyes again began to long for the sweet respite of slumber. Still, she dared not close them for a moment in the presence of these strangers, and so it was she continued to study the men—wonder of their lives before the keep—and their secrets. It was certain they owned secrets—for did not she? All human beings owned secrets—some more than others perhaps—but all owned them. Thus, she sat in contemplation. What secrets would drive men to such solitude?""Have you sorted us all out then?"" he asked unexpected. His gaze bore down upon her like the red heat of the sun. ""Have you sorted the gentlemen from the miscreants? Determined who will serve as your lover and who will be your footman?""Descended of a legendary line of strength and beauty, Saphyre Snow had once known happiness as princess of the Kingdom of Graces. Once a valiant king had ruled in wisdom—once a loving mother had spoken soft words of truth to her daughter. Yet, a strange madness had poisoned great minds—a strange fever inviting Lord Death to linger. Soon it was even Lord Death sought to claim Saphyre Snow for his own—and all Saphyre loved seemed lost.Thus, Saphyre fled—forced to leave all familiars for necessity of preserving her life. Alone, and without provision, Saphyre knew Lord Death might yet claim her—for how could a princess hope to best the Reaper himself?Still, fate often provides rescue by extraordinary venues, and Saphyre was not delivered into the hands of Death—but into the hands of those hiding dark secrets in the depths of bruised and bloodied souls. Saphyre knew a measure of hope and asylum in the company of these battered vagabonds. Even she knew love—a secreted love—a forbidden love. Yet it was love itself—even held secret—that would again summon Lord Death to hunt the princess, Saphyre Snow",http://www.distractionsinc.com/orderbook/paypalebooks.cfm,http://www.distractionsinc.com/orderbook/paypalebooks.cfm,ebook,,,"

","“My wooing began in passion, was defined by violence and circumscribed by land; all these elements molded my soul.” So writes Charles O’Brien, the unforgettable hero of bestselling author Frank Delaney’s extraordinary new novel–a sweeping epic of obsession, profound devotion, and compelling history involving a turbulent era that would shape modern Ireland. Born into a respected Irish-Anglo family in 1860, Charles loves his native land and its long-suffering but irrepressible people. As a healer, he travels the countryside dispensing traditional cures while soaking up stories and legends of bygone times–and witnessing the painful, often violent birth of land-reform measures destined to lead to Irish independence.At the age of forty, summoned to Paris to treat his dying countryman–the infamous Oscar Wilde–Charles experiences the fateful moment of his life. In a chance encounter with a beautiful and determined young Englishwoman, eighteen-year-old April Burke, he is instantly and passionately smitten–but callously rejected. Vowing to improve himself, Charles returns to Ireland, where he undertakes the preservation of the great and abandoned estate of Tipperary, in whose shadow he has lived his whole life–and which, he discovers, may belong to April and her father. As Charles pursues his obsession, he writes the “History” of his own life and country. While doing so, he meets the great figures of the day, including Charles Parnell, William Butler Yeats, and George Bernard Shaw. And he also falls victim to less well-known characters–who prove far more dangerous. Tipperary also features a second “historian:” a present-day commentator, a retired and obscure history teacher who suddenly discovers that he has much at stake in the telling of Charles’s story.In this gloriously absorbing and utterly satisfying novel, a man’s passion for the woman he loves is twinned with his country’s emergence as a nation. With storytelling as sweeping and dramatic as the land itself, myth, fact, and fiction are all woven together with the power of the great nineteenth-century novelists. Tipperary once again proves Frank Delaney’s unrivaled mastery at bringing Irish history to life. 
Praise for Frank Delaney’s TIPPERARY:
“[T]he narrative moves swiftly and surely…A sort of Irish Gone With the Wind, marked by sly humor, historical awareness and plenty of staying power.” — Kirkus Reviews“[A]nother meticulously researched journey…Delaney’s careful scholarship and compelling storytelling bring it uniquely alive. Highly recommended.” — Library Journal (starred)“Sophisticated and creative.” — 
Booklist
“Delaney’s confident storytelling and quirky characterizations enrich a fascinating and complex period of Irish history.” — Publishers Weekly“Read just a few sentences of Frank Delaney’s writing and you’ll see why National Public Radio called him ‘the world’s most eloquent man.’” — Kirkus Reviews, “Big Book Guide 2007”From the Hardcover edition.",1400065232,9781400065233),Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","This extraordinary project has been made possible because Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr have agreed to tell their combined story especially for this book. Together with Yoko Ono Lennon, they have also made available the full transcripts (including all the outtakes) of the television and video series The Beatles Anthology. Through painstaking compilation of sources worldwide, John Lennon's words are equally represented in this remarkable volume. Furthermore, The Beatles have opened their personal and management archives specifically for this project, allowing the unprecedented release of photographs which they took along their ride to fame, as well as fascinating documents and memorabilia from their homes and offices. What a book The Beatles Anthology is! Each page is brimming with personal stories and rare vintage images. Snapshots from their family collections take us back to the days when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey were just boys growing up in Liverpool. They talk in turn about those early years and how they came to join the band that would make them known around the world as John, Paul, George and Ringo. Then, weaving back and forth, they tell the astonishing story of life as The Beatles: the first rough gigs, the phenomenon of their rise to fame, the musical and social change of their heyday, all the way through to their breakup. From the time Ringo tried to take this drum kit home on the bus to their much anticipated audience with Elvis, from the making of the Sgt. Pepper album to their last photo session together at John's house, The Beatles Anthology is a once-in-a-lifetime collection of The Beatles' own memories.Interwoven with these are the recollections of such associates as road manager Neil Aspinall, producer George Martin and spokesman Derek Taylor. And included in the vast array of photographs are materials from both Apple and EMI, who also opened their archives for this project. This, indeed, is the inside story, providing a wealth of previously unpublished material in both word and image.Created with their full cooperation, The Beatles Anthology is, in effect, The Beatles' autobiography. Like their music has been a part of so many of our lives, it's warm, frank, funny, poignant and bold. At last, here is The Beatles' own story.",0811826848,9780811826846),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Apa jadinya kalo kamu harus hidup berdampingan dengan orang-orang yang mengalami gangguan jiwa di sebuah rumah sakit jiwa? Mungkin, sebagian dari kamu akan menjawab, “Jangan sampe deh!”. Tapi, bagi seorang ko-ass atau asisten dokter, mereka harus siap di tempatkan di mana saja, termasuk di rumah sakit jiwa.Hal inilah yang dialami Riva. Waktu kecil, Riva emang udah akrab dengan kata-kata gila. Karena itulah, saat ia harus ko-ass di ilmu kedokteran jiwa, ia sangat takut ketemu orang-orang berpenyakit jiwa ini, khususnya mereka yang mengidap skizofrenia.Begitu Riva sampai di tempat itu, ia pun disuruh untuk memeriksa beberapa pasien sakit jiwa yang udah menantinya. Satu masukan berharga yang ia dapatkan dari Budi—teman satu ko-assnya—adalah belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila!Akhirnya, Riva pun mengikuti saran Budi. Memang sih, saran itu benar-benar manjur dan ampuh. Terbukti, semua pasien yang ia tangani ternyata pada nurut semua, bahkan mereka tertawa dan bersikap begitu baik terhadapnya.Sayang, apa yang telah dilakukan Riva—nyanyi-nyanyi, lompat-lompat, dan menari-nari seperti orang gila—di hadapan pasiennya, ternyata sangat jauh dari bayangan suksesnya teori ‘belagak gila saat menghadapi orang gila’. Karena, yang ia hadapi saat itu adalah pasien depresi ringan.Jelas aja mereka, bisa secepat itu tertawa. Coba kalau mereka adalah pasien skizofrenia yang benar-benar parah. Mungkin, belagak gila udah nggak akan mempan lagi!Menghadapi pasien sakit jiwa ini hanyalah salah satu pengalaman konyol dan aneh Ferdiriva Hamzah atau Riva saat ko-ass. Masih banyak pengalaman gokil lainnya yang bisa kamu temukan dalam buku Cado-Cado; Catatan Dodol Calon Dokter yang diterbitkan oleh Bukuné.Selama ko-ass itu, Riva harus menghadapi berbagai macam tingkah dari pasien-pasiennya. Ada yang pemarah, pemalu, periang, penggerutu, dan sebagainya. Mulai dari merawat pasien sakit jiwa, menghadapi pasien waria yang centil-centil, sampe pasien preman pernah dilalui Riva. Kebayang dong, serunya buku ini seperti apa?! Enjoy reading!",9786028066125,9786028066125,Paperback,,208 pages,"

","The human face of povertyThe poor in India are, too often, reduced to statistics. In the dry language of development reports and economic projections, the true misery of the 312 million who live below the poverty line, or the 26 million displaced by various projects, or the 13 million who suffer from tuberculosis gets overlooked. In this thoroughly researched study of the poorest of the poor, we get to see how they manage, what sustains them, and the efforts, often ludicrous, to do something for them. The people who figure in this book typify the lives and aspirations of a large section of Indian society, and their stories present us with the true face of development.",0140259848,9780140259841),Paperback,,470 pages,"

Ever since she and her mother arrived in Chicago, she's been plagued by freaky mind-slips and vivid daydreams about her sort-of boyfriend, Webb. When Jamie's inner world starts taking her hostage and keeping her imprisoned for longer periods of time, she becomes terrified that she is slowly losing her mind.  Jamie's mom doesn't seem to notice anything is wrong. No one does -- until Jamie meets Morgan, a new friend who's had her own ""brush with nuttiness.""

","Moomin Book One is the first volume of Drawn & Quarterly’s publishing plan to reprint the entire strip drawn by Jansson before she handed over the reins to her brother Lars in 1960. This is the first time the strip will be published in any form in North America and will deservedly place Jansson among the international cartooning greats of the last century. The Moomins are a tight-knit family–hippo-shaped creatures with easygoing and adventurous outlooks. Jansson’s art is pared down and precise, yet able to compose beautiful portraits of ambling creatures in fields of flowers or on rock-strewn beaches that recall Jansson’s Nordic roots. The comic strip reached out to adults with its gentle and droll sense of humor. Whimsical but with biting undertones, Jansson’s observations of everyday life, including guests who overstay their welcome, modern art, movie stars, and high society, easily caught the attention of an international audience and still resonate today.",1894937805,9781894937801),Hardcover,,95 pages,"

","Throughout his life Isaac Babel was torn by opposing forces, by the desire both to remain faithful to his Jewish roots and yet to be free of them. This duality of vision infuses his work with a powerful energy from the earliest tales including 'Old Shloyme' and 'Childhood', which affirm his Russian-Jewish childhood, to the relatively non-Jewish world of his collection of stories entitled 'Red Cavalry'. Babel's masterpiece, 'Red Cavalry' is the most dramatic expression of his dualism and in his simultaneous acceptance and rejection of his heritage heralds the great American-Jewish writers from Henry Roth to Saul Bellow to Philip Roth.",0140449973,9780140449976),Paperback,,369 pages,"

","An electrifying thriller from the author of the international bestsellerThe Straw Men. A guilty man walks alone into the cold mountain forests of Washington State, aiming never to return. What he finds there starts a chain of events that will quickly spiral out of control. Meanwhile in Los Angeles a woman's body is discovered, sitting bolt upright in a motel bedroom. She is dead, and her killer has left his mark. It soon becomes clear he has something to say, and a lot more work to do.  And Ward Hopkins, an ex-CIA agent recovering from the recent shocking death of his parents, is on the trail of his past, tracking down the men who destroyed everything he once held dear, and the murderer whose face he sees every time he looks in the mirror. These three are ominous strands in a web of deadly secrets, roads to a dark history that should never have been told. There are people who will do anything to protect it. Anything at all. It's not a matter of who dies. We're all going to die.  What matters is who dies last.  Michael Marshall's unique voice adds a chilling intensity to the serial-killer plot, combining dazzling narrative, a white-hot pace and a deeply disturbing backdrop of conspiracy.

","During World War II, real news is a rare commodity in the hamlet of Stay More, Arkansas. But twelve-year-old Dawny - inspired by his hero Ernie Pyle - finds enough local color to keep the townsfolk reading his weekly newspaper, The Stay Morning Star. Dawny reports on the war between the Allies and the Axis, two roving bands of boys and girls fighting with sticks and spears, and competing in scrap drives and verbal jousts. But the tenor of these games changes as developments bring the world's war closer to home: the crackle of the town's first radio delivers frightening news from the outside world to the isolated village, and a native son dies on Iwo Jima. For the first time ever, an airplane darkens the skies over Stay More, and soldiers occupy the remote hills in training for an invasion of Japan. As the ways of outsiders creep into the small town's routines, the texture of rural life is irrevocably changed. Donald Harington's bittersweet tale reflects on the hilarity and calamity of childhood, the isolation that remains in intimacy, and the impending shadows of maturity that darken human nature. By turns comic, sad, and violent, When Angels Rest is a masterful work, part American tall tale, part hillbilly paradise.",1592641040,9781592641048),Paperback,,268 pages,"

Willing ladies stolen by desire, seduced into risking it all.Samuel Charles Aubrey St. Aldwyn, Duke of Gravenhurst, is a radical rogue and champion of unpopular causes. No one would dream that he is also the author of a bestselling series of dark historical novels, a writer accused of corrupting the morals of the public, and a master seducer who counts among his passionate fans wellborn Miss Lily Boscastle. But Lily is no stranger to disrepute.When her engagement to another man ends in a tarnished image and public disgrace, Lily is forced to seek employment outside London --- as housekeeper for Gravenhurst himself. Her sharp wit and sensuality appeal to his wicked instincts --- and she's a perfect match for every beguiling move he makes. Yet there's more to him than Lily imagined --- a secret known to few living souls, ghosts from the past that haunt both of their futures in ways too dangerous for even the duke to have invented.",0451413008,9780451413000),Mass Market Paperback,,342 pages,"

","I am Miss Kanagawa. In 1927, my 57 doll-sisters and I were sent from Japan to America as Ambassadors of Friendship. Our work wasn't all peach blossoms and tea cakes. My story will take you from New York to Oregon, during the Great Depression. Though few in this tale are as fascinating as I, their stories won't be an unpleasant diversion. You will make the acquaintance of Bunny, bent on revenge; Lois, with her head in the clouds; Willie Mae, who not only awakened my heart, but broke it; and Lucy, a friend so dear, not even war could part us. I have put this tale to paper because from those 58 Friendship Dolls only 45 remain. I know that someone who chooses this book is capable of solving the mystery of the missing sisters.

","While digging up a withering wax myrtle tree beside his waterfront home on the Gulf coast, author Andy Andrews unearths a rusted metal container filled with Nazi artifacts and begins an intriguing investigation that unlocks an unspoken past that took place in his backyard . . . literally . . .. . . In the summer of 1942, as the country gears up for a full-scale commitment to WWII, German subs are dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico to sink U.S. vessels carrying goods and fuel for the war. While taking a late-night walk along the coastline, Helen Mason-recently widowed by the realities of war-discovers the near-lifeless body of a German sailor. Enraged at the site of Josef Landermann's uniform, Helen is prepared to leave the lieutenant to die when an unusual phrase, faintly uttered, changes her mind.Set in a period simmering with anger and suspicion, Island of Saints offers the very real chronicle of a small town preparing itself for the worst the world has to offer. As cargo from torpedoed ships begins to wash up on the beach, Josef and Helen must reconcile their pasts in order to create a future.Blending his unique style of historical accuracy with unparalleled storytelling, New York Times best-selling author Andy Andrews offers a tale of war, faith, and forgiveness-illuminating the one principle that frees the human spirit.",English,English,Hardcover,,224 pages,"

For official purposes, these agents do not exist. They are sent out on missions to spy on terrorists, hack into crucial documents, and gather intel on global threats—all without gadgets or weapons. It is an exceptionally dangerous job, but these agents have one crucial advantage: adults never suspect that teens are spying on them. James is the latest CHERUB recruit. He’s a bit of a troublemaker, but he’s also brilliant. And CHERUB needs him. James has no idea what to expect, but he’s out of options. Before he can start in the field he must first survive one hundred grueling days of basic training, where even the toughest recruits don’t make it to the end.Class ADrugs, cars and guns! Keith Moore is Europe's biggest cocaine dealer. The police have been trying to get enough evidence to nail him for more than twenty years. Now, four CHERUB agents are joining the hunt. Can a group of kids successfully infiltrate Keith Moore's organisation when dozens of attempts by undercover police officers have failed? James Adams must start at the bottom, making deliveries for small time drug dealers and getting to know the dangerous underworld they inhabit. He needs to make a big splash if he's going to win the confidence of the man at the top.Maximum SecurityCHERUB agents are highly trained, extremely talented—and all under the age of seventeen. For official purposes, these agents do not exist. They are sent out on missions to spy on terrorists, hack into crucial documents, and gather intel on global threats—all without gadgets or weapons. It is a highly dangerous job, but these agents have one crucial advantage: Adults never suspect that teens are spying on them. In Maximum Security, James’s newest mission brings him to the sun-baked desert prison Arizona Max, home to 280 child criminals. One of them is the son of a weapons dealer who has been selling U.S. missiles to terrorists. If James can get the kid, CHERUB has a chance to stop the father. Getting into the prison is easy. Breaking out is the hard part.The KillingLeon is a small time crook who's ridden his luck for three decades. When he starts splashing big money around, the cops are desperate to know where it came from. James' latest mission looks routine: make friends with Leon's kids, infiltrate his home and dig up some leads. But the plot James begins to unravel isn't what anyone expected. And the only person who might know the truth is an eighteen-year-old boy. There's just one problem. The boy fell to his death thirteen months earlier.Divine MadnessWhen religion goes bad... When CHERUB uncovers a link between eco-terrorist group Help Earth and a wealthy religious cult known as The Survivors, James Adams is sent to Australia on an infiltration mission. It's his toughest job so far. The Survivors' outback headquarters are completely isolated and the cult's brainwashing techniques put James under massive pressure to confirm. This time, James isn't just fighting terrorists. He's got to battle to keep control of his own mind.Man vs BeastCHERUB agents are all seventeen and under. They wear skate tees and hemp, and look like regular kids. But they're not. They are trained professionals who are sent out on missions to spy on terrorists and international drug dealers. CHERUB agents hack into computers, bug entire houses, and download crucial documents. It is a highly dangerous job. For their safety, these agents DO NOT EXIST. Mainstream animal protection groups have always stayed within the law, but a new band of radical liberationists argues that if humans and animals are equal, then it's right to kill or threaten one human in order to save the lives of many animals. In a new mission, James and the other CHERUB agents must go up against the most radical group yet in a daring and violent attempt to save hundreds of lives . . . including their own.The FallWhen an MI5 mission goes disastrously wrong, James Adams needs all of his skills to get out of Russia alive. Meanwhile, his sister Lauren is on her first solo mission trying to uncover a brutal human trafficking operation. And when James does get home, he finds that his nightmare is just beginning.Mad DogsThe British underworld is controlled by gangs. When two of them start a turf war, violence explodes onto the streets. The police need information fast and James Adam has the contacts to infiltrate the most dangerous gang of all.The Sleepwalker345 people are dead... An airliner has exploded over the Atlantic leaving 345 people dead. Crash investigators suspect terrorism, but they're getting nowhere. A distressed twelve year old calls a police hotline and blames his father for the explosion. It could be a breakthrough, but there's no hard evidence and the boy has a history of violence and emotional problems.The GeneralRiots, robbery & the biggest ever training exercise. The world's largest urban warfare training compound stands in the desert near Las Vegas. Forty British commandos are being hunted by an entire American batallion. But their commander has an ace up his sleeve: he plans to smuggle in ten CHERUB agents and fight the best war game ever.Brigands M.C.Every CHERUB agent comes from somewhere. Dante Scott still has nightmares about the death of his family, brutally murdered by a biker gang. Dante is given the chance to become a member of CHERUB, a trained professional with one essential advantage: adults never suspect that children are spying on them.Shadow WaveAfter a tsunami causes massive devastation to a tropical island, its governor sends in the bulldozers to knock down villages, replacing them with luxury hotels. Guarding the corrupt governor’s family isn’t James Adams’ idea of the perfect mission, especially as it’s going to be his last as a CHERUB agent. And then retired colleague Kyle Blueman comes up with an unofficial and highly dangerous plan of his own. James must choose between loyalty to CHERUB, and loyalty to his oldest friend.",English,English,,,,,['Young Adult']

The visit, she knows, will be rough. Lizzie Island- paradise to some, a stifling prison to others- brings an onslaught of memories. It is the place of Squid' s idyllic childhood, where she and her brother, Alastair, blossomed into precocious adolescents. But Lizzie Island is also the place where Alastair died. Now the past collides with the present as Squid' s homecoming unleashes bittersweet recollections, revelations, and accusations. But nothing is what it appears to be.

","From the author of the National Book Award Winner The Round House, Louise Erdrich's breathtaking, lyrical novel of a priceless Ojibwe artifact and the effect it has had on those who have come into contact with it over the years.“Haunted and haunting. . . . With fearlessness and humility, in a narrative that flows more artfully than ever between destruction and rebirth, Erdrich has opened herself to possibilities beyond what we merely see—to the dead alive and busy, to the breath of trees and the souls of wolves—and inspires readers to open their hearts to these mysteries as well.”— Washington Post Book WorldWhile appraising the estate of a New Hampshire family descended from a North Dakota Indian agent, Faye Travers is startled to discover a rare moose skin and cedar drum fashioned long ago by an Ojibwe artisan. And so begins an illuminating journey both backward and forward in time, following the strange passage of a powerful yet delicate instrument, and revealing the extraordinary lives it has touched and defined.Compelling and unforgettable, Louise Erdrich's Painted Drum explores the often-fraught relationship between mothers and daughters, the strength of family, and the intricate rhythms of grief with all the grace, wit, and startling beauty that characterizes this acclaimed author's finest work. ",0060515112,9780060515119),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","From a cozy cottage in rustic Dorset to a magnificent mansion steeped in secrets comes a dazzling tale of lost pirate gold and legendary love... Once Olympia Wingfield had been free to devote all her time to her true passion: the study of ancient legends and long-lost treasure. But now, with three hellion nephews to raise, the absentminded beauty has very little time for research. Which makes it seem all the more serendipitous when a handsome stranger strides into Olympia's library unannounced and proceeds to set her world to rights. Tall and dark, with long, windswept black hair, Jared Ryder, Viscount Chillhurst, is the embodiment of Olympia's most exotic dreams ... a daring pirate, masquerading in teacher's garb, whose plundering kisses and traveler's tales quickly win her heart. Yet all too soon innocent Olympia will discover that the enigmatic and wickedly sensual Chillhurst is no lowly tutor, but a future earl with a wealth of secrets-—the kind that will lead them both on a perilous quest for hidden fortune and a love worth more than gold.",0553565060,9780553565065),Mass Market Paperback,,402 pages,"

","This is the forgotten story of the million white Europeans, snatched from their homes and taken in chains to the great slave markets of North Africa to be sold to the highest bidder. Ignored by their own governments, and forced to endure the harshest of conditions, very few lived to tell the tale. Using the firsthand testimony of a Cornish cabin boy named Thomas Pellow, Giles Milton vividly reconstructs a disturbing, little known chapter of history. Pellow was bought by the tyrannical sultan of Morocco who was constructing an imperial pleasure palace of enormous scale and grandeur, built entirely by Christian slave labour. As his personal slave, he would witness first-hand the barbaric splendour of the imperial court, as well as experience the daily terror of a cruel regime. Gripping, immaculately researched, and brilliantly realised, WHITE GOLD reveals an explosive chapter of popular history, told with all the pace and verve of one of our finest historians.",0340794704,9780340794708),Paperback,,316 pages,"

Bull rider Chase McKay has finally landed in a pile too big to charm his way out of. Caught with his pants down, he finds himself bucked right off the PBR tour until he can get his act together. Hollywood actress Ava Dumond became the tabloids’ favorite target when her longtime boyfriend was outed as gay. Now she wants a place to lay low and a chance to prove to herself that she can satisfy a red-blooded man between the sheets. The sexy, rugged cowboy she finds holed up in her Wyoming hideaway seems like the answer to her every fantasy. But Chase has sworn off women. Forever. Or at least a month. Whichever comes first. When they take to the road to get Chase more hands-on bull riding experience, they have every intention of keeping their hands off each other. But the two headstrong stars quickly end up riding a hot and heady rodeo circuit all their own—until the press gets wind of their affair. When the dust clears and the lights of the paparazzi fade, are they ready to give up chasing the dream for a chance of finding forever?",B0054LY182,B0054LY182,Kindle Edition,,288 pages,"

For months, even years, they faced the constant danger of discovery, fabricating new identities at a young age, sacrificing their childhoods to save their lives. These secret survivors have suppressed these painful memories for decades. Now, in The Hidden Children, twenty-three adult survivors share their moving wartime experiences -- some for the first time.There is Rosa, who hid in an impoverished one-room farmhouse with three others, sleeping on a clay pallet behind a stove; Renee, who posed as a Catholic and was kept in a convent by nuns who knew her secret; and Richard, who lived in a closet with his family for thirteen months. Their personal stories of belief and determination give a voice, at last, to the forgotten.

Rudolfo is content orchestrating the spectacle and attempting to twin his soul with Jurgen's.

With the knowledge he finds there, and his own faith in the unknown, Jurgen becomes the miracle worker of the Las Vegas strip.

","Alix’s Journal is a collection of private notebooks kept by Canadian photographer Alix Cleo Roubaud during the last four years of her life, before her death at the age of 31. Written, in a sense, for her husband—acclaimed novelist, poet, and mathematician Jacques Roubaud—Alix’s Journal straddles the gap between French and English, poetry and prose, the tragic and the comic, the profound and the quotidian. Alix’s idiosyncratic and revealing work gives us access to a singular consciousness, one that was profoundly influential on her husband’s subsequent works, in style as well as content. The notebooks center on themes of love, marriage, photography, addiction, and death, and include examples of Alix’s photographic work, whose strangeness and poignancy is enhanced by its juxtaposition with her plans for and interpretations of it.From Alix’s Journal:You left yesterday morning, and last night I got drunk by nine. I didn’t walk straight on the rue des Francs-Bourgeois, where I went to post my first letter. At ten o’clock I collapsed dead drunk. I woke at three and read what Nigel Nicholson wrote his parents, and read Jacques Roubaud in Change (a poem about water similar to Hockney’s distortions). I asked myself why I abuse myself in this manner when I am loved and really must keep alive; why do I get drunk on an empty stomach? why do I drug myself with sleeping pills? why do I smoke?     looking after oneself.I had things to do today.To fall asleep like everyone else, etc., to lead a simple regular life. To fall asleep likeeveryone else, that is what I want.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,120 pages,"

","Quand le peuple juif fut-il créé ? Est-ce il y a quatre mille ans, ou bien sous la plume d'historiens juifs du XIXe siècle qui ont reconstitué rétrospectivement un peuple imaginé afin de façonner une nation future ? Dans le sillage de la "" contre-histoire "" née en Israël dans les années 1990, Shlomo Sand nous entraîne dans une plongée à travers l'histoire "" de longue durée "" des juifs. Les habitants de la Judée furent-ils exilés après la destruction du Second Temple, en l'an 70 de l'ère chrétienne, ou bien s'agit-il d'un mythe chrétien qui aurait infiltré la tradition juive ? L'auteur montre comment, à partir du XIXe siècle, le temps biblique a commencé à être considéré par les premiers sionistes comme le temps historique, celui de la naissance d'une nation. Ce détour par le passé conduit l'historien à un questionnement beaucoup plus contemporain : à l'heure où certains biologistes israéliens cherchent encore à démontrer que les juifs forment un peuple doté d'un ADN spécifique, que cache aujourd'hui le concept d'"" État juif "", et pourquoi cette entité n'a-t-elle pas réussi jusqu'à maintenant à se constituer en une république appartenant à l'ensemble de ses citoyens, quelle que soit leur religion ? En dénonçant cette dérogation profonde au principe sur lequel se fonde toute démocratie moderne, Shlomo Sand délaisse le débat historiographique pour proposer une critique de la politique identitaire de son pays.",2081228823,9782081228825),Mass Market Paperback,,606 pages,"

","Set in a chillingly realistic far-future world, and featuring a gritty antihero even more frightening than the evil empire he serves as soldier and assassin, Death’s Head is sure to be one of the most talked-about novels of the year. David Gunn is loaded–and he shoots to kill.At the top of the galactic pecking order is the United Free, a civilization of awe-inspiring technological prowess so far in advance of other space-faring powers as to seem untouchable gods. Most of the known universe has fallen under their inscrutable sway. The rest is squabbled over by two empires: one ruled with an iron fist by OctoV, a tyrant who appears to his followers as a teenage boy but is in reality something very different, the other administered by the Uplifted, bizarre machinelike intelligences, and their no-longer-quite-human servants, cyborgs known as the Enlightened.Sven Tveskoeg, an ex-sergeant demoted for insubordination and sentenced to death, is a vicious killer with a stubborn streak of loyalty. Sven possesses a fierce if untutored intelligence and a genetic makeup that is 98.2 percent human and 1.8 percent . . . something else. Perhaps that “something else” explains how quickly he heals from even the worst injuries or how he can communicate telepathically with the ferox, fearsome alien savages whose natural fighting abilities regularly outperform the advanced technology of their human enemies. Perhaps it is these unique abilities that bring Sven to the attention of OctoV.Drafted into the Death’s Head, the elite enforcers of OctoV’s imperial will, Sven is given a new lease on life. Armed with a SIG diabolo–an intelligent gun–and an illegal symbiont called a kyp, Sven is sent to a faraway planet, the latest battleground between the Uplifted and OctoV. There he finds himself in the midst of a military disaster, one that will take all his courage–and all his firepower–to survive. But an even deadlier struggle is taking place, a struggle that will draw the attention of the United Free. Sven knows he is a pawn, and pawns have a bad habit of being sacrificed.But Sven is nobody’s sacrifice. And even a pawn can checkmate a king.From the Hardcover edition.",English,English,Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","Jordan Buchanan is thrilled that her brother and best friend are tying the knot. The wedding is a lavish affair–for the marriage of Dylan Buchanan and Kate MacKenna is no ordinary occasion. It represents the joining of two family dynasties. The ceremony and reception proceed without a hitch–until a crasher appears claiming to be a MacKenna guest. The disheveled and eccentric professor of medieval history warns that there’s “bad blood” between the couple’s clans, stemming from an ancient feud that originated in Scotland, and involving the Buchanan theft of a coveted MacKenna treasure.Jordan has always led a cautious life and has used her intelligence and reason to become a successful businesswoman. So she is intrigued but skeptical of the professor’s claims that the feud has been kept alive by the grave injustices the Buchanans have perpetrated over the centuries. But when Noah Clayborne, a close family friend and a man who has never let a good time or a pretty girl pass him by, accuses Jordan of being trapped in her comfort zone, she determines to prove him wrong and sets out on a spontaneous adventure to the small, dusty town of Serenity, Texas, to judge the professor’s research for herself.Maneuvering through a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else’s business, Jordan never anticipates the danger and intrigue that lie in her path, nor the threat that will shadow her back to Boston, where even in familiar surroundings, her life is at risk.A powerful thug who rules by fear, a man who harbors a simmering secret, and an unexpected romance that pierces all defenses–beloved author Julie Garwood weaves these dazzling elements into a brilliant novel of romantic suspense.

","Examining worldview assumptions is critically important to understanding the world and culture in which we live, knowing what to do, and how to ""create culture."" It is essential that Christ-followers be clear-thinking in these postmodern times. Contrasting the thinking of the ancient Greeks and ancient Hebrews will provide fresh ways to evaluate the messages that continually come our way.Are you aware of the underlying assumptions that shape your values and behavior? Have you given much thought to how your assumptions about what's 'really real' influence your daily actions?We often underestimate the importance of presuppositions that lie behind the values and behavior of ourselves and others. Like an iceberg floating in the ocean with just ten percent visible and ninety percent below the surface, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that words and actions are first shaped by beliefs that lie deep within the reaches of an inner concept of reality called a worldview.Going beyond values and behavior to examine the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape one's worldview is what this book is all about. Examining worldview assumptions is critically important for understanding the times and the culture in which we live. Assumptions That Affect Our Lives has helped thousands to make a difference in the way they live, by making a difference in the way they think.In a personal letter to the author, Chuck Colson wrote: ""I pray the Lord will continue to open every door to get your message to the masses. As the cultural sweep toward postmodern thinking continues to infect our educational institutions, homes and churches, the need for what you are doing is greater today than ever.""",1883035503,9781883035501),Hardcover,,273 pages,"

Immigrants such as the raven-haired Adalia Winston. But Adalia has a secret: her light skin belies that she is part black and a runaway slave from Barbados. Skilled in herbal remedies, Adalia finds employment with a local doctor and settles into her quiet life, thankful for her freedom but still fearful that her owner will find her.Born into one of Charleston's prominent families, Morgan Rutledge is handsome, bored—and enamored of the beautiful Adalia, who spurns his advances. Morgan's persistence, however, finally wins, and Adalia is swept into the glamorous world of Charleston high society.But Adalia's new life comes at a high price—that of denying her heritage and her zeal for God.

","Charles Baudelaire (1821-67) was a leading poet and novelist in nineteenth who also devoted a considerable amount of his time to criticism. Indeed it was with a Salon review that he made his literary debut: and it is significant that even at this early stage - in 1845 - he was already articulating the need for a painter who could depict the heroism of modern life. This he was to find in Constantin Guys, whom he later celebrated in the famous essay which provides the title-piece for this collection. Other material in this volume includes important and extended studies of three of Baudelaire's contemporary heroes - Delacroix, Poe and Wagner - and some more general articles, such as those on the theory and practice of caricature, and on what Baudelaire, with intentional scorn, called philosophic art. This last article develops views only touched on in Baudelaire's other writings. This volume is extensively illustrated with reproductions of works referred to in the text and otherwise relevant to it. It provides a survey of some of the most important ideas and individuals in the critical world of the great poet who has been called the father of modern art criticism.",0714833657,9780714833651),Paperback,,310 pages,"

","In incorporating social process into a model of the dynamics of mental disorders, this text questions the individualistic model favoured in current psychiatric and psychoanalytic theory. While the conventional psychiatric viewpoint seeks the causes of mental illness, Scheff views ""the symptoms of mental illness"" as the violation of residual rules - social norms so taken for granted that they are not explicitly verbalized. The sociological theory developed by Scheff to account for such behaviour provides a framework for studies reported in subsequent chapters. Two key assumptions emerge: first, that most chronic mental illness is in part a social role; and second, that societal reaction may in part determine entry into that role. Throughout, the sociological model of mental illness is compared and contrasted with more conventional medical and psychological models in an attempt to delineate significant problems for further analysis and research. This third edition has been revised and expanded to encompass the controversy prompted by the first edition, and also to re-evaluate developments in the field. New to this edition are discussions of the use of psychoactive drugs in the treatment of mental illness, changing mental health laws, new social science and psychiatric studies, and the controversy surrounding the labelling theory of mental illness itself.",0202305872,9780202305875),Paperback,,234 pages,"

","Professor Levi-Strauss's first major work, Les Structures elementaires de la Parente, has acquired a classic reputation since its original publication in 1949; and it has become the constant focus of academic debate about central theoretical concerns in social anthropology. It is, however, a long and difficult book for many students to read in French, and its arguments have consequently become known, even among professional anthropologists, largely through critical analysis. It was republished in a revised French edition in 1967 with a new foreword by the author, and it is this text with his further emendations that has been used in this translation.Levi-Strauss applies his intellectual powers to the perennial problem of incest, which he elucidates by means of the concept of exchange as formulated by Marcel Mauss in his famous analysis of the gift (Essai sur le don, 1925). He distinguishes two elementary modes of exchange which govern not only the conventional variety of goods and services but also the transfer of women in marriage: these are ""restricted"" and ""generalized"" exchange. With a mass of ethnographic evidence he demonstrates how the formidable intricacy of marriage customs, comprising moral and jural ideas and institutions (which appear to be essentially arbitrary), can be seen as local and historical rules of exchange.Charles Levi-Strauss traces these rules throughout a vast range of simple societies, chiefly in Australia and mainland Southeast Asia but also in the Americas, in Oceania, and in other parts of the world. To this survey he adds two extended sections on the great civilizations of China and India. He continues with a briefer consideration of the passage from elementary to complex structures, with particular reference to African societies, and concludes with a stimulating chapter on the principles of kinship, exchange as the universal basis for marriage prohibitions, and the formal relations between the sexes as part of a universe of communication.Although much of the work is technical, consisting of detailed analyses of types of social organization with which social anthropologists will be most familiar, it also contains much that will be of interest to psychologists, linguists, and philosophers, and to all who are interested in the possibility and the technique of the structural analysis of human activity. After the successes, moreover, of Levi-Strauss's subsequent books--notably Structural Anthropology, Tristes Tropiques, Totemism,  and The Savage Mind--this new edition of the work which founded his present outstanding reputation will have additional value as a further means of contact with one of the original minds of this century.The translation has been made by James Harle Bell and John Richard von Sturmer, of the University of New England, Australia, and by Rodney Needham, of the University of Oxford. Dr. Needham also acted as general editor and supplied the work with a new general index. He is the translator of Levi-Strauss's Le Totemisme aujourd'hui and author of Structure and Sentiment (1962) and numerous papers which have contributed to the recognition of Professor Levi-Strauss's work in the English-speaking world.",0807046698,9780807046692),Paperback,,584 pages,"

The problem is Dad modeled the fictional epic so closely to Tom's real life that fans are constantly comparing him to his counterpart, turning him into the lamest variety of Z-level celebrity. In the final novel, it's even implied that the fictional Tommy will crossover into the real world, giving delusional fans more excuses to harass Tom.When an enormous scandal reveals that Tom might really be a boy-wizard made flesh, Tom comes into contact with a very mysterious, very deadly group that's secretly kept tabs on him all his life. Now, to protect his own life and discover the truth behind his origins, Tom will travel the world, eventually finding himself at locations all featured on a very special map -- one kept by the deadly group that charts places throughout world history where fictions have impacted and tangibly shaped reality, those stories ranging from famous literary works to folktales to pop culture. And in the process of figuring out what it all means, Tom will find himself having to figure out a huge conspiracy mystery that spans the entirety of the history of fiction.Collecting: The Unwritten 1-5",1401225659,9781401225650),Paperback,Trade,144 pages,"

","In the last two decades, free markets have swept the globe, bringing with them enormous potential for positive change. But traditional capitalism cannot solve problems like inequality and poverty, because it is hampered by a narrow view of human nature in which people are one-dimensional beings concerned only with profit. In fact, human beings have many other drives and passions, including the spiritual, the social, and the altruistic. Welcome to the world of social business, where the creative vision of the entrepreneur is applied to today's most serious problems: feeding the poor, housing the homeless, healing the sick, and protecting the planet.Creating a World Without Poverty tells the stories of some of the earliest examples of social businesses, including Yunus's own Grameen Bank. It reveals the next phase in a hopeful economic and social revolution that is already under way--and in the worldwide effort to eliminate poverty by unleashing the productive energy of every human being.",1586484931,9781586484934),Hardcover,,261 pages,"

His vast empire hangs in the balance, an empire he forged with raw courage, guile, tactical brilliance, unswerving dedication to his people, and the force of his own indomitable will. Now the very qualities that united the fierce Mongol tribes threaten to tear them apart, as the heirs of Genghis maneuver for dominance. In the end, only one can command ... THE EMPIRE OF SILVER Conn Iggulden’s #1 internationally bestselling epics of historical fiction have enthralled millions of readers around the world. In his spectacular novels about the life and legacy of Genghis Khan, he has traced the path of the legendary conqueror from the harsh grasslands of his youth to the pinnacle of an unprecedented empire. Now, even as they struggle for supremacy among themselves, Genghis’s sons and grandsons extend the reach of his vision, taking their armies farther than ever before, into southern China and across the steppes and rugged mountains of Russia to the vulnerable heart of Europe, where they will face the most courageous warriors the West commands. Genghis’s tough and canny heir, Ogedai, is on the verge of being proclaimed the new Khan. But Ogedai has mysteriously delayed his coronation ceremony to complete a fantastic project many deem a folly: the building of Karakorum, a magnificent city amid the wild plains. His puzzling decision emboldens his arrogant brother Chagetai to violently challenge him, while their noble sibling Tolui and his beautiful, wily wife, Sorhatani, will be caught between the two.Chagetai’s attempt at rebellion reveals shocking truths about Ogedai’s health and imperiled future. As one brother awaits his fate, another awaits his moment to seize power, while spies and assassins play out the ambitions and destinies of their masters. With his celebrated synthesis of riveting storytelling and peerless historical detail, Conn Iggulden takes his saga of the great Mongol khans to unforgettable new heights, bringing these fabled conquerors and their singular people to vivid life for a new generation of readers.",0385339542,9780385339544),Hardcover,,387 pages,"

","Michael McIntyre has become Britain’s biggest comedy star. His debut stand-up DVD was the fastest selling of all time, only to be eclipsed by his second that sold over 1.4 million copies and was the 2009 Christmas number one. He hosts his own BAFTA nominated BBC1 series, Michael McIntyre’s Comedy Roadshow, and won the British Comedy Award for Best Live Stand-up in 2009 following his record breaking fifty-four date Arena tour.But how did he get there?Michael reveals all in his remarkably honest and hilarious autobiography Life and Laughing. His showbiz roots, his appalling attempts to attract the opposite sex, his fish-out-of-water move from public to state school and his astonishing journey from selling just one ticket at the Edinburgh Festival to selling half a million tickets on his last tour. Michael’s story is riveting, poignant, romantic and above all very, very funny.",English,English,Hardcover,,294 pages,"

","When Actress Gina Martin lands a role on a top daytime soap, she soon finds herself immersed in a glamorous world of hidden secrets and dangerous temptations. Will Gina survive the Hollywood machine, or will it consume her?  Boob Tube introduces the reader to a cast of colorful characters and stories inspired by real events. As research for the novel, the authors conducted confidential, behind-the-scenes interviews with dozens of soap opera industry insiders (actors, agents, managers, hair & makeup professionals, fan club managers, writers, etc.) who dished stories stranger than fiction. The authors wove their stories into Boob Tube, a novel that some fans have alternately described as fun, eye-opening or deeply disturbing. After reading Boob Tube, you might never view celebrity the same way again.  About the authors: Lesleyann Coker is a former reporter for Soap Opera Weekly Magazine.

She also lectures widely on autism—because Temple Grandin is autistic, a woman who thinks, feels, and experiences the world in ways that are incomprehensible to the rest of us. In this unprecedented book, Grandin delivers a report from the country of autism. Writing from the dual perspectives of a scientist and an autistic person, she tells us how that country is experienced by its inhabitants and how she managed to breach its boundaries to function in the outside world. What emerges in Thinking in Pictures is the document of an extraordinary human being, one who, in gracefully and lucidly bridging the gulf between her condition and our own, sheds light on the riddle of our common identity.",0679772898,9780679772897),Paperback,Expanded Edition,240 pages,"

But when his latest gig finds him admitted to the ER sporting an erection from hell, thanks to the little pill given to him by the director, he can’t get the pretty little nurse who treated him out of his head, even though he knows she’s so far out of his league it should be illegal.

When her friend suggests the outlandish idea of losing her virginity to the sexy and sure-to-be-skilled porn star, Alexa is mortified. But then when Cade refuses her proposition, she finds herself pissed off and embarrassed. When she tracks him down to give him a piece of her mind, she isn’t prepared for what she finds.

",يزخر تاريخ البشرية بعدد من الفلاسة الذين أثروا هذا العلم بأفكار جديدة، وأطروحات مهمة، كسقراط وأفلاطون وأرسطو، ولكن لم ينل من الفلاسفة مكانة وشهرة مثلما كان الحال مع أفلاطون.. والسبب هو محاوراته التاريخية التي ضمنها كتابه (الجمهورية)، وكانت عبارة عن دراما فلسفية حقيقية وضع فيها أفكاره حول (المدينة الفاضلة) على لسان الشخصية الرئيسية فيها (معلمه سقراط) الذي ثم إعدامه أمام عينيه، كأول رجل في التاريخ يعدم بسبب أفكاره.وكانت هذه المحاورات تعتمد على الحوار في مكان معين وزمان معين، وتدور بين سقراط وبين شخصيات معروفة يرسمها أفلاطون فى صور حية، وقد اعتمد على طريقة الحوار لأنه يرى- كما يرى أستاذه- أن الحوار والمنهج الجدلي هو طريق اكتشاف الحقيقة، وكانت هذه المحاورات تقرأ بصوت عالي ولا تمثل، وكان السامعون يجدون فيها لذة، ذلك لأنها ضرب من المأساة الفكرية تجد فيها الصراع بين الشخصيات وبين الأفكار، لذلك هي تحتاج إلى حكام عدول يفصلون في القضايا الفكرية، وترجع براعة أفلاطون إلى أنه أشرك القارئ أو السامع معه في هذه المحاورات، فالجمهورية ركن هام فيها. وهكذا كانت (المدينة الفاضلة) أو (جمهورية أفلاطون) الكتاب الذي نقدمه هنا عبارة عن تصور تخيلي لما ينبغي أن تكون عليه مدينة أرضية حقيقية. وهي كما يرى أفلاطون عبارة عن وضعية مثالية لدولة المدينة.,Arabic,Arabic,Paperback,1,225 pages,"

He’s never forgotten his first taste of innocent love and the desire that consumed them—or the pain he brought upon her…But now she belongs to another…Her long ago brush with submission awakened a longing in Ren that drove her to walk the darker edge of desire. She’s become a beautiful woman at ease with her sexuality and unapologetic about her need for a dominant man. When Cole finds her again, he’s gutted that she belongs to another. Ren’s current master agrees to give her to Cole for a short time, but then she must return to his keeping.

","Hugo Award finalist and Robert A. Heinlein Award-winning SF writer Michael Flynn returns to space opera with Up Jim River. There is a river on Dangchao Waypoint, a small world out beyond Die Bold. It is a longish river as such things go, with a multitude of bayous and rapids and waterfalls, and it runs through many a strange and hostile country. Going up it, you can lose everything.Going up it, you can find anything. The Hound Bridget ban has vanished and her employer, the Kennel (the mysterious superspy agency of the League) has given up the search. But her daughter, the harper Mearana, has not. She enlists the scarred man, Donovan, to aid her in her search. With the reluctant assent and financial aid of the Kennel, they set forth. Bridget ban was following hints of an artifact that would “protect the League from the Confederacy for aye.” Mearana is eager to follow that trail, but Donovan is reluctant, because whatever is at the end of it made a Hound disappear. What it would do to a harper and a drunk is far too easy to imagine. Donovan’s mind had been shattered by Those of Name, the rulers of the Confederacy, and no fewer than seven quarreling personalities now inhabit his skull. How can he hope to see her through safely? Together, they follow Bridget ban’s trail to the raw worlds of the frontier, edging ever closer to the uncivilized and barbarian planets of the Wild.",0765322846,9780765322845),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

To top it off, another young man from Simon's village discovers that he's a savior prophesied to destroy evil and save the realm.Prophecy has nothing to say about Simon.

","Partners now in marriage and in trade, Lady Julia and Nicholas Brisbane have finally returned from abroad to set up housekeeping in London. But merging their respective collections of gadgets, pets and servants leaves little room for the harried newlyweds themselves, let alone Brisbane’s private enquiry business.Among the more unlikely clients: Julia’s very proper brother, Lord Bellmont, who swears Brisbane to secrecy about his case. Not about to be left out of anything concerning her beloved—if eccentric—family, spirited Julia soon picks up the trail of the investigation.It leads to the exclusive Ghost Club, where the alluring Madame Séraphine holds evening séances…and not a few powerful gentlemen in thrall. From this eerie enclave unfolds a lurid tangle of dark deeds, whose tendrils crush reputations and throttle trust.Shocked to find their investigation spun into salacious newspaper headlines, bristling at the tension it causes between them, the Brisbanes find they must unite or fall. For Bellmont’s sake—and more—they’ll face myriad dangers born of dark secrets, the kind men kill to keep….",0778312372,9780778312376),Paperback,,392 pages,"

","Remember Jesus Christ? Although it seems almost too obvious, the center of our faith is surprisingly easy to forget. Dynamic pastor C.J. Mahaney shows how to overcome our tendency to move on from the gospel of grace. Finding joy in the gospel -- whose promises allow us to escape condemnation whenever it attacks -- helps us avoid the prevalent trap of legalism. With practical suggestions, Mahaney demonstrates the difference between knowing the gospel... and making it the main thing in daily decisions and daily living.What Are You Centered On? Sometimes the most important truths are the easiest to forget. It's time to get back to the starting point of the Christian life--the cross of Christ. Jesus' work on your behalf must be the central motivation for your life and faith--the main thing. ""Never move on,"" says C.J. Mahaney, who shows you how to center every day around the cross of Calvary and how to escape the pitfalls of legalism, condemnation, and feelings-driven faith.Tap into the gospel's power and see how a cross centered focus can transform your life today!",1590520459,9781590520451),Hardcover,,89 pages,"

","Stephanie Nielson began sharing her life in 2005 on nieniedialogues.com, drawing readers in with her warmth and candor. She quickly attracted a loyal following that was captivated by the upbeat mother happily raising her young children, madly in love with her husband, Christian (Mr. Nielson to her readers), and filled with gratitude for her blessed life.However, everything changed in an instant on a sunny day in August 2008, when Stephanie and Christian were in a horrific plane crash. Christian was burned over 40 percent of his body, and Stephanie was on the brink of death, with burns over 80 percent of her body. She would remain in a coma for four months.In the aftermath of this harrowing tragedy, Stephanie maintained a stunning sense of humor, optimism, and resilience. She has since shared this strength of spirit with others through her blog, in magazine features, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Now, in this moving memoir, Stephanie tells the full, extraordinary story of her unlikely recovery and the incredible love behind it—from a riveting account of the crash to all that followed in its wake. With vivid detail, Stephanie recounts her emotional and physical journey, from her first painful days after awakening from the coma to the first time she saw her face in the mirror, the first kiss she shared with Christian after the accident, and the first time she talked to her children after their long separation. She also reflects back on life before the accident, to her happy childhood as one of nine siblings, her close-knit community and strong Mormon faith, and her fairy-tale love story, all of which became her foundation of strength as she rebuilt her life.What emerges from the wreckage of a tragic accident is a unique perspective on joy, beauty, and overcoming adversity that is as gripping as it is inspirational. Heaven Is Here is a poignant reminder of how faith and family, love and community can bolster us, sustain us, and quite literally, in some cases, save us.",1401341799,9781401341794),Hardcover,,310 pages,"

The finale is the novella The Mysterious Stranger, a rarity for Mark Twain in which he turns his sardonic, freewheeling wit on eternal evil in a distant time and place—and conjures a memorable, tormenting conclusion.",0451532201,9780451532206),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","“Daddy” is not a title Rue Murray wanted, but he never thought he’d have sex with a woman either. Now he’s the unwitting father of a newborn named Alice. Between bartending and cosmetology school, Rue doesn’t have time for babies, but he can’t give her up. What Rue needs is a babysitter, and he’s running out of options. He’s on the verge of quitting school to watch Alice himself when he remembers his reclusive new neighbor, Erik.Erik Van Nuys is a sci-fi novelist with anxiety issues to spare. He doesn’t like people in general, and he likes babies even less. Still, with his royalties dwindling, he could use the extra cash. Reluctantly, he takes on the role of manny—and even more reluctantly, he finds himself falling for Alice and her flamboyant father.Rue and Erik are as different as two people can be, and Alice is the unlikeliest of babies, but Rue has never been happier than when Alice and Erik are by his side. At least, not until he receives an offer that puts all his dreams within reach and he’s forced to choose: the future he’s always wanted, or the family he thought he never did.",B0080HKOTW,B0080HKOTW,Kindle Edition,,216 pages,"

Instead, our capacity for expanding human knowledge is our greatest resource, and the key to overcoming the very real and enormous environmental challenges we face. Throughout human history we have learned to overcome scarcity and adversity through the application of innovation - the only resource that is expanded, not depleted, the more we use it. The century ahead is a race between our damaging overconsumption and our growing understanding of ways to capture and utilize abundant natural resources with less impact on the planet. The Infinite Resource is a clear-eyed, visionary, and hopeful argument for progress.",English,English,Hardcover,,364 pages,"

He has spent his entire adult life trying to outrun his violent past, but the upcoming showdown with the father he hasn’t seen in more than a decade has him spending far more time in the past than in the present.

Laura is determined to stand by Owen’s side throughout the trial and into the life they have planned together.

Can she convince Owen to let her in and allow her to help him through this difficult time? And what will become of the man she loves if his father walks free? As Owen and Laura prepare for the emotional battle with his father, his mother, Sarah, finally comes clean about her violent marriage with Charlie Grandchamp, the man who has been her friend and companion for months now.

Her creations aren’t conscious and lack their own wills and voices, but they accept sacrifices, and protect their worshippers from other gods—perfect vehicles for Craftsmen and Craftswomen operating in the divinely controlled Old World. When Kai sees one of her creations dying and tries to save her, she’s grievously injured—then sidelined from the business entirely, her near-suicidal rescue attempt offered up as proof of her instability. But when Kai gets tired of hearing her boss, her coworkers, and her ex-boyfriend call her crazy, and starts digging into the reasons her creations die, she uncovers a conspiracy of silence and fear—which will crush her, if Kai can’t stop it first.",0765335743,9780765335746),Hardcover,,382 pages,"

When a freelance photo shoot goes awry, she realizes she may have seen, and perhaps photographed, the kidnapping of a key witness in a federal probe. And although her camera was stolen, Maddie knows she has something that could be even more valuable to investigators. FBI agent Brian Beckman has spent months investigating a vicious criminal known as the Doctor, only to have a key witness abducted on his watch. Worse, he's falling for the woman who may be the Doctor's next target. Maddie's aloof facade hides a world of hurt that he wants to heal, no matter how much she keeps him at bay. But first he has to protect her from the danger that's just out of focus, drawing close enough to shoot . . . and kill.",English,English,Paperback,,374 pages,"

The Indian careers of those great English cricketers Lord Harris and D. R. Jardine provide a window into the operations of Empire, while the extraordinary life of India's first great slow bowler, Palwankar Baloo, introduces the still-unfinished struggle against caste discrimination. Later chapters explore the competition between Hindu and Muslim cricketers in colonial India and the extraordinary passions now provoked when India plays Pakistan. An important, pioneering work, this is also a beautifully-written meditation on the ramifications of sport in society at large, and on how sport can influence both social and political history.",0330491172,9780330491174),Paperback,,496 pages,"

","This is part 2 in a paranormal romance serial, read part 1 before continuing on or you'll be completely lost!  Two years ago, curvy she-wolf Aspen ran from her pack and her future as alpha female, where she was expected to choose handsome, blue-eyed Rafe, son of the current alpha, as mate and the next alpha of the pack. Now she’s back and living with three sexy former friends and pack mates, including Rafe, who promises to protect her from wolfish advances long enough for her to choose one of three potential future alphas without pressure.  Of course Rafe wants Aspen to choose him, and it has nothing to do with wanting to be alpha and everything to do with his feelings for the curvaceous she-wolf. But Aspen doesn't believe that, and it'll take time to convince her.  Time Rafe may not have, between a rogue wolf stalking Aspen and Aspen emitting pheromones that are making the other males in the house increasingly desperate to claim her for their own.  Important note from the author! Alpha Games is a romance serial about a female wolf shifter and the three sexy alphas she’s destined to choose between. The story is told in novella length episodes with cliffhangers. I’ve priced each part low enough that by the time you have purchased all parts, you’ll only have paid the price of one book (99 cents for each part). I know that this format isn’t for everyone, but I love serials and find they keep things exciting for me as a writer. I hope you enjoy if you decide to still read it.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,54 pages,"

","Nick Hawke wants his car fast and his girls faster. He blows through them quicker than his muscle car races down the drag strip in Collinsville and he wouldn’t have it any other way. He’s determined to avoid the devastation he has watched his father endure in the aftermath of his mother’s abandonment. He believes there is no room in his life or his heart for a relationship lasting more than one night. He seeks happiness in things that won’t let him down––fast cars, adrenaline highs, and one night stands. All of that changes when he unexpectedly runs into an old friend and is introduced to Payton Archer, the first girl he ever wanted for more than a night. There’s only one catch––she’s completely immune to him and his smooth talking ways.Payton Archer is looking for love––the true, mad, deep kind. She’s given up on finding it, at least until she leaves for college because she’s certain that is where she’ll find the ideal guy to fit into her perfect world. Her summer plans include nothing more than three uneventful months of fun but it turns out to be anything but ordinary when Payton meets Nick Hawke, one of Jesse’s old Collinsville friends. She’s shocked by her immediate and intense attraction for “Hawke” because nothing about him is on her checklist for the perfect love. Sure, he’s hot and sexy but he comes from Collinsville and that is definitely not on her list of prerequisites. Everything about him makes Payton’s heart speed. He’s exciting and dangerous but his fast car and chance taking aren't what scares Payton the most. It’s the way Nick Hawke makes her feel every time he looks at her. Can Payton find the courage to leave the safe, shallow end of love and risk going under completely?Shallow is Book 2 of 2 in the Going Under Series but may be read as a stand alone. This is a second edition with new editing and added scenes.This is a mature young adult/new adult novel and recommended for readers 16+ due to sexual content.",Going,#2,,Second Edition,201 pages,"

","When the Sudarium of Oviedo—the venerable cloth that once covered Jesus Christ’s face on the cross—is stolen from a cathedral in Spain, it sparks a series of grisly murders. Each victim is killed in a manner resembling the form of execution of one of the Apostles. Now, with five days until the Sudarium is to be displayed at the start of the Feast of the Cross, and with the blame of the theft pointed at the United States, CIA operative Samuel Tolen, Spanish inspector Pascal Diaz and British archaeologist Dr. Jade Mollur embark on a journey to reclaim the Sudarium. Their search takes a surprising turn when a 2,000-year-old clue suggests a far greater secret is within reach, a startling discovery that would forever change humanity, but there are others after the treasure. A rogue group called “The True Sons of Light” are determined to destroy the archaeological evidence before they can reach it. In a deadly race against time spanning four continents, Samuel Tolen’s search for the truth will uncover unspeakable deception…and the chance to answer mankind’s greatest question: Is there life after death?",http://www.williamsknerly.com,http://www.williamsknerly.com,Kindle Edition,,377 pages,"

","""Il 9 gennaio 1993, Jean-Claude Romand ha ucciso moglie, figli e genitori. Poi ha tentato, invano, di suicidarsi. L'indagine ha rivelato che non era un medico come aveva sempre sostenuto e, cosa ancor piú difficile da credere, non era nient'altro. Mentiva da diciotto anni, ma la sua menzogna non copriva nulla. Quando stava per essere scoperto, ha preferito sopprimere tutte le persone di cui non avrebbe mai potuto reggere lo sguardo. È stato condannato all'ergastolo. lo sono entrato in contatto con lui, ho assistito al suo processo. Ho tentato di raccontare con precisione, giorno dopo giorno, questa vita di solitudine, d'impostura e d'assenza. Di immaginare cosa gli passava per la testa durante le lunghe ore vuote, senza progetti né testimoni, che avrebbe dovuto trascorrere al lavoro e invece passava nei parcheggi autostradali o nei boschi del Jura. Di capire che cosa, in un'esperienza umana tanto estrema, mi ha toccato cosi da vicino. E tocca, credo, ciascuno di noi"" (Emmanuel Carrère).",8806155792,9788806155797),Paperback,,164 pages,"

","Andy and I had been best friends since we were eight-years old. Watching him slowly fade away, ever closer to his final breath, made me so incredibly angry. I knew there was nothing I could do to change it--I had given in to despair, but Andy had not. He had one last hand to play.  He wasn't going to simply sit back and wait for Death to claim him--not Andy. He was going to live life until he couldn't hold his eyes open any longer.  Andy didn't want to die in some sterile hospital and asked me to take him and Emily to the beach. It would be our last road trip together.  Emily. Emily was a problem for me.  I harbored a secret that would have torn our friendship apart. I was in love with Andy's girl, and had been since she'd walked into our sixth grade class, so many years ago.  So what kind of person am I? My best friend is dying, and it's awful--but my heart still aches for his girl. I hate myself for thinking beyond Andy's death and whether there could ever be a future for Emily and I, but I can't help it.  I'm in love with her.  *** All books in the Love Hurts series are standalone novels that can be read in ANY order. *** Pre order book 4, Don't Hold Back for $2.99 and SAVE $2.00: http://a.co/7Eui9hp *** Get Always You for 99 CENTS: http://a.co/3nYdQSa *** Get Words Left Unsaid ON SALE for $2.99: http://a.co/2NkwIrT",English,English,Kindle Edition,,296 pages,"

Die Hauptstadt: ein maroder Moloch, verpestet und verdreckt von Millionen Ölmotoren des Trabant-Nachfolgers Phobos. Die letzte Chance für den Sozialismus: Wirtschaftsverhandlungen mit der BRD und ihrem Bundeskanzler Oskar Lafontaine.Doch dann wird ein ehemaliger Berater von Krenz ermordet aufgefunden – und alles weist darauf hin, dass die Täter aus den Reihen der Stasi kommen. Als auch noch der SPIEGEL über diesen Fall berichtet, ist klar: Wird die Unschuld der Stasi nicht bewiesen, ist die DDR endgültig erledigt.Im grauen, zerfallenden Ostberlin suchen Martin Wegener von der Volkspolizei und sein westdeutscher Kollege Richard Brendel nach den Mördern – und finden heraus, warum die Entwicklung der DDR so katastrophal verlaufen musste.Mit Witz und beißender Ironie erzählt Simon Urban eine packende Geschichte über politischen und menschlichen Verrat, über die vergebliche Suche nach Wahrheit und Liebe.

","For more than a millennium, the fox has been a ubiquitous figure at the margins of the Japanese collective imagination. In the writings of the nobility and the motifs of popular literature, the fox is known as a shapeshifter, able to assume various forms in order to deceive others. Focusing on recurring themes of transformation and duplicity in folklore, theology, and court and village practice, The Fox's Craft explores the meanings and uses of shapeshifter fox imagery in Japanese history. Michael Bathgate finds that the shapeshifting powers of the fox make it a surprisingly fundamental symbol in the discourse of elite and folk alike, and a key component in formulations of marriage and human identity, religious knowledge, and the power of money. The symbol of the shapeshifter fox thus provides a vantage point from which to understand the social practice of signification.",0415968216,9780415968218),Hardcover,,191 pages,"

","From internationally acclaimed New Face of Fiction author Padma Viswanathan, a stunning new work set among families of those who lost loved ones in the 1985 Air India bombing, registering the unexpected reverberations of this tragedy in the lives of its survivors. A book of post-9/11 Canada, The Ever After of Ashwin Rao demonstrates that violent politics are all-too-often homegrown in North America but ignored at our peril. In 2004, almost 20 years after the fatal bombing of an Air India flight from Vancouver, 2 suspects--finally--are on trial for the crime. Ashwin Rao, an Indian psychologist trained in Canada, comes back to do a ""study of comparative grief,"" interviewing people who lost loved ones in the attack. What he neglects to mention is that he, too, had family members who died on the plane. Then, to his delight and fear, he becomes embroiled in the lives of one family caught in the undertow of the tragedy, and privy to their secrets. This surprising emotional connection sparks him to confront his own losses. The Ever After of Ashwin Rao imagines the lasting emotional and political consequences of a real-life act of terror, confronting what we might learn to live with and what we can live without.",0307356345,9780307356345),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

Told through a cinematic narrative that weaves back and forth through time and place, the story explores Driver's near existential moral foundations, intercut with moments of bloody violence.",0156030322,9780156030328),Paperback,,168 pages,"

","Click your heels three times and say, “There’s no place like Bloomies!”Katie Chandler’s life is pure magic–literally. As an executive assistant at Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., she’s seen more than her share of fantastical occurrences. A mere Manhattan mortal, Katie is no wizard, but she’s a wiz at exposing “hokum” pocus, cloaked lies, and deceptive enchantments. And she’s fallen under the all-too-human spell of attraction to Owen, a hunky wizard and coworker. Owen, however, is preoccupied. Someone has broken into his office and disrupted top-secret files, and it reeks of an inside job. CEO Merlin (yes, the Merlin) taps Katie and her special ability to uncover the magical mole.Keeping her feelings in check while sleuthing alongside Owen, Katie is shocked to discover that her immunity to magic is waning, putting her in grave danger. Soon she’s surrendering to the charms and enchantments of everyone and everything around her, including a killer pair of red stilettos. Katie must now conjure up her natural instincts to get to the bottom of the break-in, regain her power, and win the wizard of her dreams.",0345481275,9780345481276),Paperback,,303 pages,"

","Drawing from a ten-year photography project, We Animals documents animals in the human environment, showing that humans are as much animals as the creatures used for food, clothing, research, experimentation, work, entertainment, slavery, and companionship. Through pictures shot in more than 40 countries and on all seven continents, award-winning photojournalist and animal advocate Jo-Anne McArthur breaks down the barriers that humans have built which allow non-human animals to be treated as objects. Ultimately, We Animals provides a valuable lesson about our treatment of animals, makes animal industries visible and accountable, and widens our circle of compassion to include all sentient beings. In McArthur's words: ""My goals have always been to educate people about our treatment of animals. To reduce their suffering. To widen our circle of compassion to include non-human animals. To make animal industries visible, and accountable.""",English,English,Hardcover,,202 pages,"

He dreams of broomstick tours and souvenir potions, but the closest he can get to a witchy experience is sitting in class with his awful teacher Mrs. Frabbleknacker, who smells like bellybutton lint and forbids Rupert’s classmates from talking to each other before, during, and after class. So when he sees an ad to become a witch’s apprentice, Rupert simply can’t resist applying. But Witchling Two isn’t exactly what Rupert expected. With a hankering for lollipops and the magical aptitude of a toad, she needs all the help she can get to pass her exams and become a full-fledged witch. She’s determined to help Rupert stand up to dreadful Mrs. Frabbleknacker too, but the witchling's magic will be as useful as a clump of seaweed unless Rupert can figure out a way to help her improve her spellcasting—and fast!",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,272 pages,"

","Riley Hayes, the playboy of the Hayes family, is a young man who seems to have it all: money, a career he loves, and his pick of beautiful women. His father, CEO of HayesOil, passes control of the corporation to his two sons; but a stipulation is attached to Riley's portion. Concerned about Riley's lack of maturity, his father requires that Riley 'marry and stay married for one year to someone he loves'. Angered by the requirement, Riley seeks a means of father's stipulation. Blackmailing Jack Campbell into marrying him ""for love"" suits Riley's purpose. There is no mention in his father's documents that the marriage had to be with a woman and Jack Campbell is the son of Riley Senior's arch rival. Win win.Riley marries Jack and abruptly his entire world is turned inside out. Riley hadn't counted on the fact that Jack Campbell, quiet and unassuming rancher, is a force of nature in his own right. This is a story of murder, deceit, the struggle for power, lust and love, the sprawling life of a rancher and the whirlwind existence of a playboy. But under and through it all, as Riley learns over the months, this is a tale about family and everything that that word means.",B004MDLQDG,B004MDLQDG,Kindle Edition,1st Edition,412 pages,"

","James Lee Burke's eagerly awaited new novel finds Detective Dave Robicheaux back in New Iberia, Louisiana, and embroiled in the most harrowing and dangerous case of his career. Seven young women in neighboring Jefferson Davis Parish have been brutally murdered. While the crimes have all the telltale signs of a serial killer, the death of Bernadette Latiolais, a high school honor student, doesn't fit: she is not the kind of hapless and marginalized victim psychopaths usually prey upon. Robicheaux and his best friend, Clete Purcel, confront Herman Stanga, a notorious pimp and crack dealer whom both men despise. When Stanga turns up dead shortly after a fierce beating by Purcel, in front of numerous witnesses, the case takes a nasty turn, and Clete's career and life are hanging by threads over the abyss. Adding to Robicheaux's troubles is the matter of his daughter, Alafair, who is on leave from Stanford Law to put the finishing touches on her novel. Her literary pursuit has led her into the arms of Kermit Abelard, celebrated novelist and scion of a once prominent Louisiana family whose fortunes are slowly sinking into the corruption of Louisiana's subculture. Abelard's association with bestselling ex-convict author Robert Weingart, a man who uses and discards people like Kleenex, causes Robicheaux to fear that Alafair might be destroyed by the man she loves. As his daughter seems to drift away from him, he wonders if he has become a victim of his own paranoia. But as usual, Robicheaux's instincts are proven correct and he finds himself dealing with a level of evil that is greater than any enemy he has confronted in the past.Set against the backdrop of an Edenic paradise threatened by pernicious forces, James Lee Burke's ""The Glass Rainbow ""is already being hailed as perhaps the best novel in the Robicheaux series.",1439128294,9781439128299),Hardcover,,433 pages,"

But Reyaz, brother to Cypher the warlock king, has vowed retribution for a life that was taken from him. Now Cypher must decide not only how to protect his newfound mate and his people, but also how to destroy the only family he has left.Meanwhile, Jen’s pregnancy progresses and the fateful due date draws ever nearer. The thought of losing Decebel’s child constantly threatens to overwhelm her. With each passing day, Decebel grows more distant, causing Jen to wonder what toll the impending loss of their child is taking on him. Unbeknownst to Jen, in an act of desperation to protect his unborn child and mate, Decebel strikes a deadly bargain with the Great Luna—his life in place of his child’s. There is only one way for that to happen; the bond between he and Jen must be broken.As Jen as Decebel struggle through their darkness, another kind of darkness is infiltrating Fane’s heart. Doubts and questions linger as he tries to cope with the emotions brought on in the aftermath of Desdemona’s curse.

","Efteråret er tid for lejrskoler, og sådan er det også for Freddy. Det er ikke så ringe endda, for så skal han ikke sidde og sløve den af derhjemme. Da han ankommer med rutebil dagen efter alle de andre pga. sygdom, får han imidlertid den forklaring af lejrlederen, at lejrskolen er brændt ned, så han er nødt til at tage tilbage til busholdepladsen og køre hjem. Men da det er mørkt, farer han vild og falder over vennerne fra Neanderslottet. De er ved at lave en kur til Nitan, som er syg. Straks sætter Freddy sig for at hjælpe dem, og de tager hjem for at hælde en eliksir på bøvsedragen. Det viser sig dog, at det ikke er sygdom men derimod dvale, som Nitan er påvirket af. Den er nemlig ved at forberede sig på det møde bøvsedrager holder hvert tusinde år. Det er ikke noget, nogle af vore venner nogen sinde har hørt om, så de beslutter sig for at følge med Nitan. Selv Freddy kan tage med, fordi forældrene ikke venter ham tilbage fra lejrskole før en uge senere. De er dog ikke klar over hvad der venter dem, og hvad Bøvsedragernes hemmelighed egentlig er. Det går i samme stil med ""Bøvsedragernes hemmelighed"" som med de to foregående bind, ""Balladen om den forsvundne mumie"" og ""Brædder til Draculas kiste"". Persongalleriet er uændret, og tempoet er lige så højt. Det er dejligt at se bøvsedragen få den opmærksomhed, som den manglede i de to første bind. For dem, der foretrækker Eddie eller andre af figurerne, er der dog ikke i synderlig grad sparet på udfoldelserne. Nye læsere kan godt starte med ""Bøvsedragernes hemmelighed"", men det anbefales at have læst de foregående bøger først; om ikke andet, så for at få et godt grin.",8758806857,8758806857,Paperback,,133 pages,"

Eight years later, a schoolteacher who lived four miles away gave birth to a boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast growing tumors that soon riddled his face and chest. The doctors predicted he would not reach his first birthday. They were wrong, but that was only one of many surprises that would eventually come to light in Toms River, culminating in 2001 with a record legal settlement believed to top $35 million and an unprecedented government study confirming the existence of a long-suspected cluster of childhood cancer linked to polluted water and air. A detective story rooted in a scientific quest thousands of years old, Toms River is a tale of dumpers at midnight and deceptions in broad daylight, of corporate avarice and government neglect, and of a few brave individuals who would not keep silent.",English,English,Hardcover,,560 pages,"

When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives in a tall house by the sea.

Narra el superviviente cómo se inició el proyecto, como junto a un gran equipo de aeroplanos, trineos y en principio todo lo indispensable para que el proyecto llegara a buen puerto; todo se torna en desgracia por un vuelo de reconocimiento donde se topan con una impresionante cordillera oscura llena de maldad.

","Self-mutilation is a behavior so shocking that it is almost never discussed. Yet estimates are that upwards of eight million Americans are chronic self-injurers. They are people who use knives, razor blades, or broken glass to cut themselves. Their numbers include the actor Johnny Depp, Girl Interrupted author Susanna Kaysen, and the late Princess Diana.Mistakenly viewed as suicide attempts or senseless masochism--even by many health professionals--""cutting"" is actually a complex means of coping with emotional pain. Marilee Strong explores this hidden epidemic through case studies, startling new research from psychologists, trauma experts, and neuroscientists, and the heartbreaking insights of cutters themselves--who range from troubled teenagers to middle-age professionals to grandparents. Strong explains what factors lead to self-mutilation, why cutting helps people manage overwhelming fear and anxiety, and how cutters can heal both their internal and external wounds and break the self-destructive cycle. A Bright Red Scream is a groundbreaking, essential resource for victims of self-mutilation, their families, teachers, doctors, and therapists.",0140280537,9780140280531),Paperback,,234 pages,"

The higher the waters rise, the nearer Noah's ark was lifted up to heaven; the more thy afflictions are increased, the more thy heart shall be raised heavenward.Thomas Brooks (1608-1680) entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1625.

After the Civil War, Brooks became minister at Thomas Apostle’s, London, and was sufficiently renowned to be chosen as preacher before the House of Commons in 1648. In 1662 he fell victim to the notorious Act of Uniformity, but he appears to have remained in his parish and to have preached the Word as opportunity offered.

","Bipolar disorder simultaneously gives you both an amazing and a terrible outlook on life. This is a book of Melissa Burke’s personal journal entries as well as some poems, written over the past few years. The goal is to shed light on mental illness for people who don’t understand it while at the same time reminding those who do suffer from it that they aren't alone. This is also to show that even if you don’t have any mental illness, life can be a roller coaster. But things do get better. Perfect? No, never. But life doesn't have to be perfect to become a beautiful journey.***TRIGGER WARNING***You know by the description that this deals with bipolar disorder. One of the specific things is sexual assault. In general there is a lot of depression, therefore many mentions of self harm as well as an eating disorder, etc. I would love for people to buy/read this book but if you will be triggered by any of that PLEASE do NOT read it.",English,English,Paperback,,246 pages,"

","Howson was een krieltje. Krom, lelijk en kreupel. Het soort mensen dat men liever niet ziet. Wanneer hij zich echter diep concentreerde, kon hij zijn gedachten duizenden mijlen diep de ruimte in projecteren en kon hij de menselijke geest tot de diepste duisternis peilen. Zijn telepathische vermogens reikten verder dan men ooit eerder in de geschiedenis had ervaren... en hij werd de grootste genezer van zijn tijd.Maar wanneer hij afdaalde in de menselijke geest, speurend naar hun nachtmerries, kon men dan van deze kriel verwachten dat hij de duistere machten kon hanteren?",9061202027,9061202027,Paperback,,208 pages,"

","Queen Victoria rules with an immortal fist.  The undead matriarch of a Britain where the Aristocracy is made up of werewolves and vampires, where goblins live underground and mothers know better than to let their children out after dark. A world where being nobility means being infected with the Plague (side-effects include undeath), Hysteria is the popular affliction of the day, and leeches are considered a delicacy. And a world where technology lives side by side with magic. The year is 2012 and Pax Britannia still reigns.Xandra Vardan is a member of the elite Royal Guard, and it is her duty to protect the Aristocracy. But when her sister goes missing, Xandra will set out on a path that undermines everything she believed in and uncover a conspiracy that threatens to topple the empire.

","Andre Roussimoff is known as both the lovable giant in The Princess Bride and a heroic pro-wrestling figure. He was a normal guy who'd been dealt an extraordinary hand in life. At his peak, he weighed 500 pounds and stood nearly seven and a half feet tall. But the huge stature that made his fame also signed his death warrant.Box Brown brings his great talents as a cartoonist and biographer to this phenomenal new graphic novel. Drawing from historical records about Andre's life as well as a wealth of anecdotes from his colleagues in the wrestling world, including Hulk Hogan, and his film co-stars (Billy Crystal, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, etc), Brown has created in Andre the Giant, the first substantive biography of one of the twentieth century's most recognizable figures.",English,English,Paperback,,240 pages,"

","""This is not a book about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else."" So begins Fareed Zakaria's important new work on the era we are now entering. Following on the success of his best-selling The Future of Freedom, Zakaria describes with equal prescience a world in which the United States will no longer dominate the global economy, orchestrate geopolitics, or overwhelm cultures. He sees the ""rise of the rest""—the growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, Russia, and many others—as the great story of our time, and one that will reshape the world. The tallest buildings, biggest dams, largest-selling movies, and most advanced cell phones are all being built outside the United States. This economic growth is producing political confidence, national pride, and potentially international problems. How should the United States understand and thrive in this rapidly changing international climate? What does it mean to live in a truly global era? Zakaria answers these questions with his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination.",039306235X,9780393062359),Hardcover,,292 pages,"

","R is a young man with an existential crisis--he is a zombie. He shuffles through an America destroyed by war, social collapse, and the mindless hunger of his undead comrades, but he craves something more than blood and brains. He can speak just a few grunted syllables, but his inner life is deep, full of wonder and longing. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse. Just dreams. After experiencing a teenage boy's memories while consuming his brain, R makes an unexpected choice that begins a tense, awkward, and strangely sweet relationship with the victim's human girlfriend. Julie is a burst of vibrant color in the otherwise dreary and gray landscape that R lives in. His decision to protect her will transform not only R, but his fellow Dead, and perhaps their whole lifeless world...Scary, funny, and surprisingly poignant, Warm Bodies is about being alive, being dead and the blurry line in between.",1439192316,9781439192313),Hardcover,USA Edition,256 pages,"

","Published in rapid succession in the middle 1930s, Journey to the End of the Night and Death on the Installment Plan shocked European literature and world consciousness. Nominally fiction but more rightly called ""creative confessions,"" they told of the author's childhood in excoriating Paris slums, of service in the mud wastes of World War I and African jungles. Mixing unmitigated despair with Gargantuan comedy, they also created a new style, in which invective and obscenity were laced with phrases of unforgettable poetry. Céline's influence revolutionized the contemporary approach to fiction. Under a cloud for a period, his work is now acknowledged as the forerunner of today's ""black comedy.""Death on the Installment Plan is the story of young Ferdinand's first 18 years. His life is one of hatred, of the grinding struggle of small shopkeepers to survive, of childhood sensations and fantasies – lusty, scatological, violent, but also poetic. There is a running battle with his ineffectual insurance clerk of a father, with his mother, who lives and whines around the junkshop she runs for the boys benefit; there is also the superbly funny Meanwell College in England where the boy went briefly, a Dickensian, nightmare institution. Always there is humiliation, failure, and boredom, at least until he teams up with the ""scientist"" des Pereires. This inventor, con-man, incorrigible optimist – whose last project is to grow enormous potatoes by electricity – rescues him, if only temporarily; for the reader he is one of the most lovable charlatans in literature.",9643058263,9789643058265),Paperback,,723 pages,"

","The first kidnappings happened two hundred years before. Some years it was two boys taken, some years two girls, sometimes one of each. But if at first the choices seemed random, soon the pattern became clear. One was always beautiful and good, the child every parent wanted as their own. The other was homely and odd, an outcast from birth. An opposing pair, plucked from youth and spirited away.This year, best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good & Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.. But what if the mistake is actually the first clue to discovering who Sophie and Agatha really are…?",0007492944,9780007492947),ebook,,496 pages,"

","Mag, powieść o fabule obfitującej w niezwykłe zwroty akcji i zaskakujące rozwiązania, należy do arcydzieł literatury współczesnej. Bohater książki, młody Anglik Nicholas Urfe, przyjmuje stanowisko nauczyciela na pewnej greckiej wyspie, gdzie zaprzyjaźnia się z właścicielem najwspanialszej posiadłości. Przyjaźń z milionerem wprowadzi młodzieńca w świat prawdziwego koszmaru. Z każdym dniem rzeczywistość i fantazje coraz bardziej się mieszają, a Urfe staje się nieświadomym aktorem prywatnego teatru bogacza - styka się ze śmiercią, seksem i straszliwą przemocą. Powoli, desperacko zaczyna walczyć o zachowanie zdrowia psychicznego i... życia. Akcji, stanowiącej prawdziwy labirynt zdarzeń, towarzyszą kulturowe szarady i zagadki, a sama powieść prowokuje do zastanowienia się nad iluzorycznością otaczającego nas świata i funkcjonujących w nim zasad moralnych. Symbolika powieści - pełna aluzji literackich - potwierdza przyznanie przez Fowlesa autorowi dzieła literackiego statusu ""maga"".(Text used in description taken from the book cover.)",8386211652,9788386211654),Paperback,Wydanie w serii Kameleon,767 pages,"

","Grey Haward has always detested the Chemists, the magicians-come-scientists who rule her small western town. But she has always followed the rules, taking the potion the Chemists ration out that helps the town’s people survive. A potion that Grey suspects she—like her grandfather and father—may not actually need.By working at her grandfather’s repair shop, sorting the small gears and dusting the curio cabinet inside, Grey has tried to stay unnoticed—or as unnoticed as a tall, strong girl can in a town of diminutive, underdeveloped citizens. Then her best friend, Whit, is caught by the Chemists’ enforcers after trying to protect Grey one night, and after seeing the extent of his punishment, suddenly taking risks seems the only decision she can make.But with the risk comes the reality that the Chemists know her family’s secret, and the Chemists soon decide to use her for their own purposes. Panicked, Grey retreats to the only safe place she knows—her grandfather’s shop. There, however, a larger secret confronts her when her touch unlocks the old curio cabinet in the corner and reveals a world where porcelain and clockwork people are real. There, she could find the key that may save Whit’s life and also end the Chemists’ dark rule forever.",English,English,Hardcover,,432 pages,"

"," Lost World, the fourth book in the Broken World series, continues following a group of survivors after a super-virus has destroyed the world and the dead have come back to claim it as their own...   With their shelter destroyed and their sense of security shattered, Vivian, Axl and the group set off in search of a safe place. But the group’s morale is at an all-time low, and they now know it’s not just the dead they have to fear. Weeks of wandering brings sickness, death and loss to the survivors, and Vivian soon finds herself losing hope of ever discovering a safe place to live. To make matters worse, two members of the group go missing, leaving the others to wonder not only what happened to them, but if they will ever see their friends alive again.  After what happened in Vegas, Hadley feels like a stranger in her own body. When she and Jon get separated from the rest of the group, she finds herself confronted not only with the scars left behind by her ordeal, but facing the possibility of a new beginning with Jon at her side.  In a twist of fate, Vivian and Axl stumble upon a place that could be the group’s salvation, only to have hope slip through their fingers once again when they are met with the most devastating blow yet… ",Broken,#4,ebook,,,"

And June is the only survivor. Alone and directionless, June drives across the country, away from her small Connecticut town. In her wake, a community emerges, weaving a beautiful and surprising web of connections through shared heartbreak.

Elegant and heartrending, and one of the most accomplished fiction debuts of the year, Did You Ever Have a Family is an absorbing, unforgettable tale that reveals humanity at its best through forgiveness and hope.

","When Helen Macdonald's father died suddenly on a London street, she was devastated. An experienced falconer—Helen had been captivated by hawks since childhood—she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators, the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral temperament mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel, and turned to the guidance of The Once and Future King author T.H. White's chronicle The Goshawk to begin her challenging endeavor. Projecting herself ""in the hawk's wild mind to tame her"" tested the limits of Macdonald's humanity and changed her life.Heart-wrenching and humorous, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement and a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, with a parallel examination of a legendary writer's eccentric falconry. Obsession, madness, memory, myth, and history combine to achieve a distinctive blend of nature writing and memoir from an outstanding literary innovator.",English,English,Hardcover,,300 pages,"

","A roboticist imagines life with robots that sell us products, drive our cars, even allow us to assume new physical form, and more.With robots, we are inventing a new species that is part material and part digital. The ambition of modern robotics goes beyond copying humans, beyond the effort to make walking, talking androids that are indistinguishable from people. Future robots will have superhuman abilities in both the physical and digital realms. They will be embedded in our physical spaces, with the ability to go where we cannot, and will have minds of their own, thanks to artificial intelligence. In Robot Futures, the roboticist Illah Reza Nourbakhsh considers how we will share our world with these creatures, and how our society could change as it incorporates a race of stronger, smarter beings.Nourbakhsh imagines a future that includes adbots offering interactive custom messaging; robotic flying toys that operate by means of ""gaze tracking""; robot-enabled multimodal, multicontinental telepresence; and even a way that nanorobots could allow us to assume different physical forms. Nourbakhsh examines the underlying technology and the social consequences of each scenario. He also offers a counter-vision: a robotics designed to create civic and community empowerment. His book helps us understand why that is the robot future we should try to bring about.",English,English,Hardcover,,160 pages,"

","An extraordinary and heartbreaking love story set during America's age of innocence — and against a backdrop of wealth and privilege.In Riven Rock, T.C. Boyle transforms two real people from the pages of American history into rich mythic creations whose tortured love and epic story is intimate enough to break our hearts.Boyle anchors his unforgettable tale with the remarkable and courageous Katherine Dexter. Her husband, Stanley McCormick, thirty-one-year-old son of the millionaire inventor of the Reaper, has become schizophrenic and a sexual maniac. Stanley is locked up in his Santa Barbara mansion and forbidden the mere sight of women — above all, his wife. Throughout her career as a scientist and suffragette, Katherine's faith never wavers: that, one day, one of the many psychiatrists she hires to try to cure her husband will free him of his demons.One of America's most imaginative contemporary novelists, Boyle weaves his hallmark virtuoso prose into a masterful epic. Textured with his acclaimed humor, versatility, and imagination, Riven Rock is his most fully realized and compassionate novel to date.",014027166X,9780140271669),Paperback,,466 pages,"

","Coralina Corissa, known as “Coco” to her eight sisters, is the prettiest princess of a hundred kingdoms. And she knows it. Her beauty has always given her anything she wanted... and any man she wanted.Runa Realm is facing a new threat. Strange bandits, disguised as nobles, are attacking beautiful women to steal their hair. Coralina isn’t concerned. Until Prince Luxley, her favorite (but not only) lover, gets clobbered by a peasant called Gord, who mistakenly assumed the prince was a bandit.Outraged, Coralina plans to punish the peasant by deliberately breaking his heart. But Gord is nearly blind. For the first time ever, Coralina must rely on more than her looks to ensnare a man. But the harder she flirts, the more Gord seems to hate her. And the more her own heart (and hair) becomes endangered.The Nine Princesses Novellas is a series that chronicles the adventures of an unconventional family of princesses, the struggles they face in a kingdom often hostile to their humble origins, and the day-to-day dramas of nine young women whose personalities often clash like swords. Fans of Gail Carson Levine and Shannon Hale would enjoy this young-adult series. Recommended for ages 12 and up.

","A groundbreaking work of science that confirms, for the first time, the independent existence of the mind–and demonstrates the possibilities for human control over the workings of the brain.Conventional science has long held the position that 'the mind' is merely an illusion, a side effect of electrochemical activity in the physical brain. Now in paperback, Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and Sharon Begley's groundbreaking work, The Mind and the Brain, argues exactly the opposite: that the mind has a life of its own.Dr Schwartz, a leading researcher in brain dysfunctions, and Wall Street Journal science columnist Sharon Begley demonstrate that the human mind is an independent entity that can shape and control the functioning of the physical brain. Their work has its basis in our emerging understanding of adult neuroplasticity–the brain's ability to be rewired not just in childhood, but throughout life, a trait only recently established by neuroscientists.Through decades of work treating patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), Schwartz made an extraordinary finding: while following the therapy he developed, his patients were effecting significant and lasting changes in their own neural pathways. It was a scientific first: by actively focusing their attention away from negative behaviors and toward more positive ones, Schwartz's patients were using their minds to reshape their brains–and discovering a thrilling new dimension to the concept of neuroplasticity.The Mind and the Brain follows Schwartz as he investigates this newly discovered power, which he calls self–directed neuroplasticity or, more simply, mental force. It describes his work with noted physicist Henry Stapp and connects the concept of 'mental force' with the ancient practice of mindfulness in Buddhist tradition. And it points to potential new applications that could transform the treatment of almost every variety of neurological dysfunction, from dyslexia to stroke–and could lead to new strategies to help us harness our mental powers. Yet as wondrous as these implications are, perhaps even more important is the philosophical dimension of Schwartz's work. For the existence of mental force offers convincing scientific evidence of human free will, and thus of man's inherent capacity for moral choice.",0060988479,9780060988470),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","Was gibt es Besseres beim Lesen, als einer literarischen Figur ganz nah zu sein? In ihre Haut zu schlüpfen, sie ganz und gar zu verstehen; das denken, was sie denkt, das fühlen, was sie fühlt. Eins werden mit der Person. Arthur Schnitzler war einer der ersten, denen mit der Technik des inneren Monologs genau dies gelang. Zuerst in Lieutenant Gustl 1900, dann in Fräulein Else 1924. Zwei sehr unterschiedliche Figuren werden hier dargestellt, mit zwei völlig verschiedenen Lebens- und Gefühlswelten. Der junge Offizier, der von einem nicht satisfaktionsfähigen Bäckermeister beleidigt wird und sich deshalb, obwohl niemand den Vorfall mitbekommen hat, nach dem Ehrenkodex der Armee erschießen müßte, durchleidet eine Nacht der Todesangst -- bis er morgens erfährt, daß jener Bäckermeister einem Schlaganfall erlegen ist. Dann die junge Anwaltstochter Else, die von ihrer Mutter gebeten wird, den Vater aus einer Schuldenmisere zu befreien und einen befreundeten Kunsthändler um das Geld zu bitten; als dieser seine finanzielle Hilfe aber unter die Bedingung stellt, Else nackt sehen zu dürfen, verzweifelt sie an den moralischen Konflikten, entblößt sich im Musikzimmer des Hotels und nimmt eine Überdosis Veronal. Das Lesen der beiden Novellen ist wie ein Sog. Man wird immer weiter hineingezogen in die Seelenzustände von Gustl und Else, in ihre Verwirrung, Assoziationen, Erinnerungen. Und man leidet mit ihnen in diesen extremen Grenzsituationen. Am Ende findet man nur schwer zurück in die eigene Welt. Denn das Ich der Personen macht Schnitzler so erlebbar und plastisch, wie kaum ein anderer deutschsprachiger Erzähler dies vermochte. --Lilli Belek",3150181569,9783150181560),Taschenbuch,,101 pages,"

The poems in Sylvia Plath's Ariel, including many of her best-known such as 'Lady Lazarus', 'Daddy', 'Edge' and 'Paralytic', were all written between the publication in 1960 of Plath's first book, The Colossus, and her death in 1963.

 'If the poems are despairing, vengeful and destructive, they are at the same time tender, open to things, and also unusually clever, sardonic, hardminded . . . They are works of great artistic purity and, despite all the nihilism, great generosity . . . the book is a major literary event.' A. Alvarez in the Observer

","Han pasado tres años desde que Mía, tras el trágico accidente, dejó su ciudad natal en la Costa Oeste para iniciar su nueva vida en Juilliard, el prestigioso conservatorio de Nueva York. Y también tres años desde que abandonó a Adam sin darle explicaciones. La idea de perder a Mía supuso para Adam un auténtico tormento, que cristalizó en un puñado de desgarradas canciones que los catapultaron a él y su banda, los Shooting Star, a la fama. Ahora, convertido en una estrella de rock, con una novia famosa y acosado continuamente por fans y periodistas, Adam vive sumido en un estado de permanente hastío y confusión. Hasta que una noche, en Nueva York, su camino vuelve a cruzarse con el de Mía, convertida ya en la excepcional chelista que prometía ser. El inesperado encuentro se prolongará hasta el amanecer y les brindará la ocasión de abordar lo que ocurrió realmente en el pasado y lo que el futuro podría depararles.Narrada desde el punto de vista de Adam, Lo que fue de ella retoma los personajes de Si decido quedarme, el bestseller internacional de Gayle Forman que describe con asombroso realismo el turbulento horizonte emocional de una adolescente que logra recuperarse de una situación límite. La nueva novela, cuyo éxito ha superado al de la anterior, confirma el talento de esta autora para escribir sobre los temas más delicados con exquisita sensibilidad y sencillez.",8498384850,9788498384857),Paperback,,224 pages,"

Half the city believes him to be a legendary champion of the poor. The other half believe him to be a foolish myth. Nobody has it quite right.Slightly built, unlucky in love, and barely competent with a sword, Locke Lamora is, much to his annoyance, the fabled Thorn. He certainly didn't invite the rumors that swirl around his exploits, which are actually confidence games of the most intricate sort. And while Locke does indeed steal from the rich (who else, pray tell, would be worth stealing from?), the poor never see a penny of it. All of Locke's gains are strictly for himself and his tight-knit band of thieves, the Gentlemen Bastards.Locke and company are con artists in an age where con artistry, as we understand it, is a new and unknown style of crime. The less attention anyone pays to them, the better! But a deadly mystery has begun to haunt the ancient city of Camorr, and a clandestine war is threatening to tear the city's underworld, the only home the Gentlemen Bastards have ever known, to bloody shreds. Caught up in a murderous game, Locke and his friends will find both their loyalty and their ingenuity tested to the breaking point as they struggle to stay alive...",English,English,Mass Market Paperback,,722 pages,"

Birçok araştırmacı ve yazar tarafından Türk edebiyatında bir ilk kabul edilen Dokuzuncu Hariciye Koğuşu, Tanpınar dediği gibi, “acının ve ıstırabın yegâne kitabı” olarak hem kemiyet hem de keyfiyet bakımından başka hiçbir eser olmasa da Türk romanının var olduğuna delil gösterilebilecek kudrette bir eserdir. Romanın genç kahramanı, ayağındaki rahatsızlıktan kurtulabilmek için sayısız doktora görünür ve en nihayetinde havadar bir ortamda, stresten uzak bir istirahat dönemi geçirmesi gerektiğine ikna edilir. Ancak, gerek akrabaları olan bir Paşa’nın Erenköyü’ndeki köşkünde misafir kaldığı dönemde, gerekse kendi evi ve hastaneye gidiş gelişlerinde şuurunu adeta bir facia atmosferinde yoğurur. Peyami Safa’nın çocukluk ve gençlik dönemlerinden fazlasıyla izler taşıyan roman, hem umudu ve umutsuzluğu, hem de sevinci ve felaketi aynı sayfalara sığdırabilmiş olması bakımından insanın eşsiz bir tarifini sunuyor.",9789754370485,9789754370485,Paperback,,124 pages,"

","In 1878, a struggling prospector found silver in the jagged mountains of Arizona. Within a year the town of Tombstone was filling up with merchants, tradesmen, gamblers, whores, and gunslingers. And then the Earp family came to Tombstone-five brothers with their women and their wives. Along with Doc Holliday and a band of thieves, Wyatt Earp treated the Arizona territory as his personal stomping grounds-until Wells Fargo decided to put an end to a string of savage stage robberies. With the legend of the OK Corral shootout fanning out across the frontier, private detective Luke Starbuck was sent to Tombstone to find the truth. And when he got there, Starbuck's mission turned into one burning, personal obsession: to kill Wyatt Earp....AUTHORBIO: MATT BRAUN is a fourth generation Westerner, steeped in the tradition and lore of the frontier era. His books reflect a heritage rich with the truths of that bygone time. Raised among the Cherokee and Osage tribes, Braun learned their traditions and culture, and their philosophy became the foundation of his own beliefs. Like his ancestors, he has spent most of his life wandering the mountains and plains of the West. His heritage and his contribution to Western literature resulted in his appointment by the Governor of Oklahoma as a Territorial Marshal.Braun is the author of forty-three novels and four nonfiction works, including BLACK FOX, which was made into a CBS miniseries. Western Writers of America awarded Braun the prestigious Spur Award for his novel THE KINCAIDS.",English,English,Paperback,,207 pages,"

","It’s 1986, and what should have been the greatest summer of Nate Bradford’s life goes sour when his parents suddenly divorce. Now, instead of spending his senior year in his hometown of Austin, Texas, he’s living with his father in Warren, Wyoming, population 2,833 (and Nate thinks that might be a generous estimate). There’s no swimming pool, no tennis team, no mall—not even any MTV. The entire school’s smaller than his graduating class back home, and in a town where the top teen pastimes are sex and drugs, Nate just doesn’t fit in.Then Nate meets Cody Lawrence. Cody’s dirt-poor, from a broken family, and definitely lives on the wrong side of the tracks. Nate’s dad says Cody’s bad news. The other kids say he’s trash. But Nate knows Cody’s a good kid who’s been dealt a lousy hand. In fact, he’s beginning to think his feelings for Cody go beyond friendship.Admitting he might be gay is hard enough, but between small-town prejudices and the growing AIDS epidemic dominating the headlines, a town like Warren, Wyoming, is no place for two young men to fall in love.Word count 90,000; page count: 340",B01D7V51FC,B01D7V51FC,Kindle Edition,,290 pages,"

Dear Reader,Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal? To journey through the night stalking the evil that preys on humans? To have unlimited wealth, unlimited power? That is my existence, and it is dark and dangerous. I play hero to thousands, but am known to none. And I love every minutes of it.Or so I thought until one night when I woke up handcuffed to my worst nightmare: a conservative woman in a button-down shirt. Or in Amanda's case, one buttoned all the way up to her chin. She's smart, sexy, witty, and wants nothing to do with the paranormal--in other words, me.My attraction to Amanda Devereaux goes against everything I stand for. Not to mention the last time I fell in love it cost me not only my human life, but also my very soul. Yet every time I look at her, I find myself wanting to try again. Wanting to believe that love and loyalty do exist.Even more disturbing, I find myself wondering if there's any way a woman like Amanda can love a man whose battle scars run deep, and whose heart was damaged by a betrayal so savage that he's not sure it will ever beat again.Kyrian of Thrace",0312979983,9780312979980),Mass Market Paperback,,309 pages,"

Haunting them both are twelve scars Hawley carries on his body, from twelve bullets in his criminal past—a past that eventually spills over into his daughter’s present, until together they must face a reckoning yet to come. This father-daughter epic weaves back and forth through time and across America, from Alaska to the Adirondacks. Both a coming-of-age novel and a literary thriller, The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley explores what it means to be a hero, and the cost we pay to protect the people we love most.  ",English,English,Kindle Edition,,399 pages,"

","A chicken is regarded to be in a state of good health when all of its body organs and systems are normal and perfectly functioning. Any alteration in the state of its body, or of any of its organs, which interferes with the proper performance of its function(s) is what is regarded as a disease. Naturally, chickens are flock animals, therefore, have the potential to spread very fast any contaminated disease amongst them. While on the contrary, it is a dream of every chicken keeper to want to raise healthy and disease free flock. The benefits of doing so can never be over emphasized. Some of the invaluable topics covered herein include: Signs exhibited by sick chickens. Stress in chickens (Causes and Control). Vices in Chickens (Causes and Control). Predisposing factors to chicken diseases. The most common chicken diseases (symptoms, causes, preventions and treatments).

Not for long, however, because she's made up her mind to escape -- if only for a few days -- so she can live the life of an ordinary person. All she needs is the perfect disguise...and she's just found it. As an entire nation searches for her, the First Lady teams up with an infuriatingly secretive, quietly seductive stranger and two adorable little orphaned girls in need of a family. And all together they head out across the heartland chasing their own American Dream -- on a wild journey, adventure, and glorious rebirth.Author Biography: Susan Elizabeth Phillips, soared into the New York Times bestseller list with her 1998 smash Dream A Little Dream, and remained there through two subsequent novels, Lady Be Good and First Lady.

","Like the swallows, our son Ollie came in the spring and left in the autumn. Dancing, singing, swooping - there was something birdlike about his energy, joy and laughter - but also the fleeting, enigmatic quality of his life.When he was two he lost all his speech, as autism turned his life - and ours - into a baffling challenge. Then at four he had to face a new challenge when he almost died from leukaemia. But chemotherapy worked its magic and he made a full recovery. He was a tough survivor and nothing seemed to dim his spirit: he could light up a room and energize everyone around him. So it was a huge shock, after several cancer-free years, when a fatal brain tumour was discovered. This time his body had had enough and he died very suddenly. He was twelve.Ollie had extraordinary courage and endurance. Time after time he bounced back, determined to enjoy life. He was obstinate, mischievous, playful, flirtatious, quixotic, funny. He generated - and continues to generate - huge amounts of laughter. And he was very beautiful. We always felt that if autism had not unravelled the wiring of his neural pathways, he would have achieved extraordinary things.This is the story of the journey we made with Ollie. Unlike a mountaineer, pursuing extreme experiences out of choice, he had difficulty thrust upon him: he was forced to be brave. For me, too, the journey was far more compelling than any expedition.",009947879X,9780099478799),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","There seems to be some odd things going on in the city of London lately. Take the murders, for instance; quite peculiar. And those missing statues. What's going on there? And shouldn't St. Paul’s Church have a roof? Odd. Horatio Lyle, of course, is no stranger to . . . well, strangeness. In fact, he finds the lure of the unknown quite invigorating. But having just survived the most frightening episode in his life, the last thing he wants is that pompous Lord Lincoln sticking his nose in again and demanding that he take on another case the police are too thick to solve. Of course, His Lordship can be painfully persuasive at times, so it should come as no surprise that Lyle, along with his young protégés Tess (the thief) and Thomas (the rich kid), and his faithful hound Tate (the smart one), is soon up to his neck in events of a singularly unscientific nature.",1904233694,9781904233695),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","The story is set in the Ptolemaic era of ancient Egyptian history and revolves around the survival of a dynasty bloodline protected by the Priesthood of Isis. The main character Harmachis (the living descendant of this bloodline) is charged by the Priesthood to overthrow the supposed impostor Cleopatra, drive out the Romans, and restore Egypt to its golden era.As is the case with the majority of Haggard's works, the story draws heavily upon adventure and exotic concepts. The story, told from the point of view of the Egyptian priest Harmachis, is recounted in biblical language, being in the form of papyrus scrolls found in a tomb. Haggard's portrait of Cleopatra is quite stunning, revealing her wit, her treachery, and her overwhelming presence. All of the characters are mixtures of good and evil, and evoke both sympathy and loathing.",140216002X,9781402160028),,,278 pages,"

","The world has no air. If you want to survive, you pay to breathe. But what if you can't? And what if you think everything could be different? Three teens will leave everything they know behind in Sarah Crossan's gripping and original dystopian teen novel of danger, longing, and glimmering hope that will appeal to fans of Patrick Ness and Veronica Roth.National Book Award Finalist Kathleen Duey called Breathe ""An amazing story! Sit down. Inhale. Now, while you still can."" Ever since the Switch, when the oxygen levels plummeted and most of humanity died, the survivors have been protected in glass domes full of manufactured air. Protected . . . or trapped? Or controlled? Alina's a revolutionary who believes we can save the environment. Quinn's a Premium who's never had to worry about having enough air. His best friend, Bea, is an Auxiliary who's never worried about anything but having enough air. When the three cross paths, they will change everything. Sarah Crossan's thrilling and provocative novel is about passion, about yearning for something better, and about breaking free for the very first time. The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books proclaims it an ""action-packed dystopian series opener to watch out for.""",B007HBY132,B007HBY132,Kindle Edition,,389 pages,"

","Escrito por um grupo de economistas, professores, jornalistas e analistas financeiros, O livro da economia apresenta as bases do pensamento que pautou a evolução e as diversas teorias da economia em todo o mundo. Numa escrita ágil, o livro aborda a história de como a humanidade criou e entendeu o dinheiro, o comércio, a especulação, as crises econômicas a partir dos principais nomes desta ciência.Fartamente ilustrado, O livro da economia é dividido em seis partes: “Iniciem o comércio (400 a.C.-1770)”, “A Era da Razão (1770-1820)”, “Revoluções industrial e econômica (1820-1929)”, “Guerra e depressões (1929-1945)”, “Economia no pós-guerra (1945-1970)” e “Economia contemporânea (1970-presente)”. Cada uma delas destaca teorias econômicas dos mais renomados pensadores, de Aristóteles a John Maynard Keynes, passando por Max Weber, John Stuart Mill, Vilfredo Pareto, Joseph Schumpeter e Paul Krugman. É possível entender, assim, a “mão invisível do mercado” de Adam Smith ou o “valor-trabalho” de Karl Marx, por exemplo. Mas também saber do surgimento do primeiro banco (Florença, 1397), das primeiras cédulas impressas (Banco da Escócia, 1696), da criação do FMI (1944) e do nascimento dos Tigres Asiáticos (acordo Japão-Coreia do Sul, 1965), além do impacto do vapor e dos computadores em importantes revoluções na história econômica humana.O livro da economia traz também glossário de termos específicos e apêndice com informações sobre outros economistas e suas contribuições ao estudo dessa área do conhecimento.",852505240X,9788525052407),Paperback,,352 pages,"

But while West may be Big Man on Campus on the outside, on the inside he’s battling the grief that comes with watching his father slowly die of cancer.Two years ago, Maggie Carleton’s life fell apart when her father murdered her mother. And after she told the police what happened, she stopped speaking and hasn’t spoken since. Even the move to Lawton, Alabama, couldn’t draw Maggie back out. So she stayed quiet, keeping her sorrow and her fractured heart hidden away.As West’s pain becomes too much to handle, he knows he needs to talk to someone about his father—so in the dark shadows of a post-game party, he opens up to the one girl who he knows won’t tell anyone else.West expected that talking about his dad would bring some relief, or at least a flood of emotions he couldn’t control. But he never expected the quiet new girl to reply, to reveal a pain even deeper than his own—or for them to form a connection so strong that he couldn’t ever let her go…",1481438859,9781481438858),Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Pride and Prejudice has delighted generations of readers with its unforgettable cast of characters, carefully choreographed plot, and a hugely entertaining view of the world and its absurdities. With the arrival of eligible young men in their neighborhood, the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and their five daughters are turned inside out and upside down. Pride encounters prejudice, upward-mobility confronts social disdain, and quick-wittedness challenges sagacity, as misconceptions and hasty judgements lead to heartache and scandal, but eventually to true understanding, self-knowledge, and love. In this supremely satisfying story, Jane Austen balances comedy with seriousness, and witty observation with profound insight. If Elizabeth Bennet returns again and again to her letter from Mr Darcy, readers of the novel are drawn even more irresistibly to its captivating wisdom.--back cover",0192802380,9780192802385),Paperback,"Oxford World Classics, UK / USA",333 pages,"

"," The Egg & I is a humorous memoir by American author Betty MacDonald about her travails as a young wife on an Olympic Peninsula chicken farm. It was a successful novel & was adapted into a movie & tv series. The movie, starring Fred MacMurray & Claudette Colbert, was the inspiration for a series of ten Ma & Pa Kettle movies starring Marjorie Main & Percy Kilbride. The series was tv's 1st comedy serial & aired on CBS from 9/3/51 to 8/1/52. The book is based on the author's experiences in trying to operate a small chicken farm with her 1st husband Robert Heskett from 1927-31 near Chimacum, WA. On visits to family in Seattle, she told of their tribulations, which greatly amused them. In the 1940s, MacDonald's sisters encouraged her to write a book about these experiences. Following their advice, she wrote The Egg & I as her 1st book. The Egg & I received laudatory reviews & soon appeared on the best-seller list. In 4/46 Universal-International announced the purchase of the film rights for a downpayment of $100,000 plus a profit percentage. Contracts were signed with Claudette Colbert & Fred MacMurray for the lead roles with production scheduled for fall 1946. On 9/12/46, a specially-bound one-millionth copy of the book was presented to MacDonald by Gov. Monrad Wallgren at a Seattle luncheon. The movie, directed by Chester Erskine & produced by Fred Finklehoffe, began showing in theaters on 4/24/47. The 1st offshoot film, Ma & Pa Kettle, appeared in theaters in 8/49.",English,English,cloth,,236 pages,"

","""For fractured souls are like magnets.Drawn to collide into an impossible bliss…""Labeled a ‘Cursed’ woman of Eve from birth, Maddie has endured nothing but pain and repression at the hands of The Order’s most abusive elder, Moses. Now living with her sister in The Hangmen’s secluded compound, finally, Maddie, is free. Free from the suffocating faith she no longer believes in. Free from endless years of physical and mental torment.Just… free…At age twenty-one, the timid and shy Maddie is content to live within the confines of her new home—safe from the outside world, safe from harm and, strangely, protected by the Hangmen’s most volatile member; the heavily pierced and tattooed, Flame. Flame. The man who ceaselessly watches over her with his midnight dark and searing eyes. The man who protects her with a breath-taking intensity. And the man who stirs something deep within her numbed heart.  But when circumstances conspire for Flame to need HER help, Maddie bravely risks it all for the broken man who has captivated her fragile soul. The Hangmen’s most infamous member, Flame, is ruled by one thing—anger. Plagued by haunting demons from his past, an all-consuming rage, and isolated by an abhorrent hatred of being touched, Flame's days are filled with suffocating darkness, pierced only by a single ray of light—Maddie. The shy, beautiful woman he cannot purge from his thoughts. The woman he has an overwhelming need to possess… ... the only person who has ever been able to touch him. Flame’s mission in life is to protect Maddie, to keep her safe. Until a trigger from his troubled past sends him spiraling into madness, trapping him in the deepest recesses of his disturbed mind. His Hangmen brothers fear that Flame is beyond saving. His only hope of salvation: Maddie and her healing light.Dark Contemporary Romance.Contains explicit sexual situations, violence, disturbingly sensitive and taboo subjects, offensive language, and very mature topics.Recommended for age 18 years and over.",1516846540,9781516846542),Paperback,,462 pages,"

","A private investigator hunts a killer & uncovers a fantastic & horrifying secret. An important man is murdered & there are numerous suspects--each from a different planet. A computer helps a young man solve a puzzle & assumes the personality of a long-dead gangster. Isaac Asimov has conspired with collaborators Martin Harry Greenberg & Charles G. Waugh to mastermind this diabolically clever anthology in which each of the classic categories of crime fiction is represented by a science fiction tale. Here are such science fiction greats as Philip K. Dick, Larry Niven, Clifford Simak, Jack Vance & the illustrious Dr. Asimov himself writing cosmic variations on the whodunit, how-done-it, why-done-it, the hard-boiled detective, the police procedural & even a brand-new category--the psychic detective story.9 • The Universe of Science Fiction • essay by Isaac Asimov13 • The Detweiler Boy • (1977) • Tom Reamy49 • The Ipswich Phial • [Lord Darcy] • (1976) • Randall Garrett97 • Second Game • (1958) • Katherine MacLean and Charles V.

","In this anniversary portrait Michael Farr reveals the complex personality of Herge, the remarkable artist behind Tintin, the boy reporter who continues to thrill and delight an ever-widening audience. In seven separate sketches Farr presents a picture of a man whose life is the key to his creation.  First introduced in 1929, The Adventures of Tinin remains a constant source of reference throughout this new book, which draws on fresh material found in the extensive archive of Studios Herge, and from interviews with those who knew Herge intimately.  Generously illustrated, it examines the life and passions of a man who, despite his international fame, preferred to avoid the limelight, finding inspiration in modern art, the latest scientific developments and world affairs, and seeking enlightenment in Zen Buddhism and philosophy. It considers his role as the European pioneer of the strip cartoon, and establishes his role developing contemporary cinema.

","When a half-drowned elf is found floating in the seas of the Blue Divide, an old mystery resurfaces. Thirty years ago, an elven prince led an expedition in search of a legendary magic said to be more powerful than any in the world. Of all those who set out on that ill-fated voyage, not one has ever returned. Until now. The rescued elf carries a map covered with mysterious symbols–and Walker Boh, the last of the Druids, has the skill to decipher them. But someone else understands the map’s significance: the Ilse Witch, a ruthless young woman who wields a magic as potent as his own. She will stop at nothing to possess the map–and the magic it leads to.
Thus begins the first volume of a dazzling new adventure in one of the most popular fantasy series of our time

Having soothed the hurt feelings of one group who threatened to quit, Duncan now faces a whole new group of crayons asking to be rescued. From Maroon Crayon, who was lost beneath the sofa cushions and then broken in two after Dad sat on him; to poor Turquoise, whose head is now stuck to one of Duncan's stinky socks after they both ended up in the dryer together; to Pea Green, who knows darn well that no kid likes peas and who ran away—each and every crayon has a woeful tale to tell and a plea to be brought home to the crayon box.

In January 1915, after battling its way for six weeks through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day’s sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed. But for Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men, the ordeal had barely begun. It would end only after a miraculous journey through more than 850 miles of the South Atlantic’s heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. In Endurance, the definitive account of Shackleton’s fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing voyage that has defined heroism for the last century.",B00IC8VF10,B00IC8VF10,Kindle Edition,,292 pages,"

","For countless generations the sword had been kept hidden, ready for a time of need. But not hidden well enough, because on one warm July night in1937 it vanished - its disappearance swallowed up in the storm clouds of war that would soon engulf the world.1941 - twelve SS generals gather at a castle in East Prussia to re-enact an ancient rite and call on the spirits of Europe's mightiest warriors to aid them in the coming battle in the East. At the heart of the ritual is a pentagram formed by five swords. One of them is Excalibur, the mythical weapon pulled from a stone by King Arthur.2010 - Art recovery expert Jamie Saintclair laughs when he reads the codex to a German war veteran's will, the strange ritual it describes and the mention of a sword named Excalibur. But collector Adam Steele is convinced - and if Jamie can find the legendary sword, he will pay a small fortune for it. The hunt for Excalibur takes Jamie from Germany to eastern Poland and a deadly encounter in Hitler's Wolf's Lair. The castle has been destroyed down to the last stone and the only clue to the sword's fate is the strange tale of a wartime partisan unit murdered by its own commander.With a team of international assassins on his trail and the distinction between friend and enemy a blur, Jamie finally makes it back to a Britain under siege, where the last piece of the puzzle falls into place and he discovers that the line between obsession and madness is gossamer thin...",English,English,ebook,,480 pages,"

","The publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final Harry Potter novel, is probably the most eagerly anticipated event in the history of publishing. Even the smallest hints from author J. K. Rowling about what may happen to Harry and his friends have been major news stories.In The End of Harry Potter?, David Langford—Potter fan and award-winning writer—delves into the many mysteries which remain unsolved. Is Albus Dumbledore really dead? Whose side is Severus Snape really on? What are the remaining horcruxes, where He Who Shall Not Be Named has stashed his soul? Does Harry bear a part of the Dark Lord's soul in his scar, and is this why he understands Parseltongue?J. K. Rowling is the only person who knows the answers to these questions. But in this highly entertaining book, Langford uses his deep knowledge of the six published Harry Potter novels to explore these and other mysteries, and to present a selection of possible outcomes.Only the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will lay these questions to rest, but in the meantime, fans of the series will find David Langford's book entertaining and thought-provoking, and a perfect way to refresh their memory of the first six books in readiness for the last.",0765319349,9780765319340),Paperback,,208 pages,"

Luckily for Her Majesty's Government, all these talents also make her a first-rate spy...  India Black, full-time madam and occasional secret agent, is feeling restless, when one of Disraeli's men calls on her to meet the prime minister--alone. Even though all her previous meetings have been organized by the rakishly handsome spy French, it's been decided this is a mission India must attempt on her own.  Revolt has spread across Europe and reached the shores of England--anarchists have begun assassinating lords and earls, one by one. Now India must infiltrate the ranks of the underground group responsible for those attacks, the sinister Dark Legion. To stop their dread plot, India will go from the murkiest slums of London to the highest levels of society, uncovering secrets that threaten her very existence...

","From #1 Amazon bestselling writer of Pretend You’re Mine, Lucy Score delivers once again with the conclusion to the Sinner & Saint story.  In this suspenseful sequel to Crossing the Line, movie star Waverly Sinner has a gunshot wound and a missing fake boyfriend and the only man who can help her now is the one who broke her heart five years ago, Xavier Saint. When charming leading man Dante Wrede offered Waverly a new way to use her acting talents, she jumped at the chance. Undercover work is exciting and challenging. But when their assignment is cut short by a hail of gunfire, Waverly is left bleeding and alone with a cover story that could ruin her career.  It’s been five years since Waverly almost died because of a mistake he made. But when Xavier Saint catches the latest mess the actress has gotten herself into, he faces facts. He’s never stopped loving her and she still obviously needs his protection. But when he tracks her down in secluded paradise, it’s clear she’s not working on her issues in rehab as the media reported. And she’s definitely not happy to see him or willing to trust him with anything more than half-truths.  They have an attraction that won’t die, but without trust there’s no hope for a future together. The only shot Xavier has at winning her back is helping her find Dante Wrede, the man he thinks she loves. When a plot to frame her for kidnapping and murder materializes, their rag tag team of conspirators need to work fast and play dirty to clear her name. He’s got just one shot at proving her innocence and winning her back forever.  Author’s Note: This is the conclusion of Waverly and Xavier’s story that began with Crossing the Line. It takes place five years after the end of Crossing the Line.",Sinner,#2,Kindle Edition,1st Edition,413 pages,"

Deeply ashamed of his nation’s leaders, fifteen-year-old Knud Pedersen resolved with his brother and a handful of schoolmates to take action against the Nazis if the adults would not. Naming their secret club after the fiery British leader, the young patriots in the Churchill Club committed countless acts of sabotage, infuriating the Germans, who eventually had the boys tracked down and arrested. But their efforts were not in vain: the boys' exploits and eventual imprisonment helped spark a full-blown Danish resistance. Interweaving his own narrative with the recollections of Knud himself, here is Phil Hoose's inspiring story of these young war heroes. ",1338030116,9781338030112),Paperback,,208 pages,"

","Den Tod muss man nicht fürchten. Er ist nämlich, wie er als Ich-Erzähler von sich selbst in einer Vorbemerkung sagt, „bemüht, dieser ganzen Angelegenheit eine fröhliche Seite zu verleihen“. Nur hätten die meisten Menschen „einen tief sitzenden Widerwillen, der es ihnen unmöglich macht, mir zu glauben, so sehr ich auch versuche, sie davon zu überzeugen“. Mit einem weiteren Vorurteil räumt der Tod gleich zu Beginn auf, dass ihm nämlich die Menschen gleichgültig seien. Im Gegenteil. Ab und zu, so erfahren wir, braucht er sogar eine Auszeit, um sich abzulenken. „Ihr wollt wissen“, fragt er, „wovon ich mich ablenken muss? (…) Es sind die übrig gebliebenen Menschen. / Die Überlebenden.“ Eine solche Überlebende, „eine Expertin im Zurückbleiben“ ist die neunjährige Liesel Memminger. Von ihr handelt dieses wunderbare Buch. Zum ersten Mal begegnet der Tod der neunjährigen Liesel 1939 am Grab ihres kleinen Bruders, wo sie auch ihre Karriere als Bücherdiebin beginnt: Mit Hilfe des Handbuchs für Totengräber lernt sie das Lesen und muss fortan immer wieder Bücher stehlen. Sie „rettet“ auch welche -- vor den Flammen der Nazis. Und hin und wieder bekommt sie auch welche geschenkt. Ihre Liebe zu Büchern muss es sein, die den Tod, der sich selbst hier als großer Erzähler erweist, die Liesel lieb gewinnen lässt. Während um sie herum Bombenhagel alles in Schutt und Asche legen, findet sie Schutz im Keller – und in ihren Büchern. Der Tod, den der Autor uns hier präsentiert, muss man in der Tat nicht fürchten. Er ist weder böse noch kaltblütig. Und er hat eine Schwäche für Menschen, die lesen und die Bücher lieben. Ist das nicht beruhigend? Und er kann obendrein -- zumindest in der Fantasie Markus Zusaks -- wunderbar erzählen. -- Andreas Vierecke, Literaturanzeiger.de",German,German,Paperback,,586 pages,"

","Genç İtalyan yazarı Susanna Tamaro'nun bu kitabı, yayımlandığında İtalya'da büyük yankılar uyandırmış, yıl boyunca en 'çok satan kitaplar' listesinin başından inmemişti. Umberto Eco'nun 'Gülün Adı' romanından sonra, en başarılı İtalyan romanı olarak karşılanan Yüreğin Götürdüğü Yere Git, seksen yaşında bir büyükannenin, uzaklardaki torununa yazdığı mektuplardan oluşuyor. Alabildiğine yalın, gündelik konuşma diliyle yazılmış olan bu sevgi dolu mektuplar, hem bir içdöküş, hem de bir bilgenin vasiyeti niteliğinde. Yaşlı büyükanne, bu mektuaplardan, kendisinin ve kızının dokunaklı yaşamlarını gizli kalmış yönlerini açığa vururken, kendine karşı bir iç hesaplaşmayı da birlikte yürütüyor. Değişen gelenekler, alt üst olmuş değerler karşısında hissettikkerini, torununa sevgiyle aktarmaya çalışan bu yaşlı kadın, gençliğinde yapmayı göze alamadığı şeyleri yapmasını torununa öğütlerken, bir yerde şöyle diyor: ""Yapmaya değecek tek yolculuk, içimize yaptığımız yolculuktur; o özgün çağrıya kulak vermeli, yüreğimizin götürdüğü yere gitmeliyiz.""

","The Gray House is an astounding tale of how what others understand as liabilities can be leveraged into strengths.Bound to wheelchairs and dependent on prosthetic limbs, the physically disabled students living in the House are overlooked by the Outsides. Not that it matters to anyone living in the House, a hulking old structure that its residents know is alive. From the corridors and crawl spaces to the classrooms and dorms, the House is full of tribes, tinctures, scared teachers, and laws—all seen and understood through a prismatic array of teenagers’ eyes.But student deaths and mounting pressure from the Outsides put the time-defying order of the House in danger. As the tribe leaders struggle to maintain power, they defer to the awesome power of the House, attempting to make it through days and nights that pass in ways that clocks and watches cannot record.",B01JZAKPF0,B01JZAKPF0,Kindle Edition,,736 pages,"

","Escrito no estilo colorido e poético dos velhos contos orientais, eis-nos perante um romance que é ao mesmo tempo uma apaixonada meditação sobre a verdadeira essência da Pérsia, aqui abordada sucessivamente em dois períodos cruciais da sua história: A dominação da dinastia turcomana dos Seljúcidas, nos séculos XI e XII. O dealbar do século XX em que despontam os anseios de reformas democráticas e de emancipação patriótica.Na primeira parte, assistimos ao desabrochar do génio de Omar Khayyam, poeta, filósofo, matemático e astrónomo, em cujo livro de quadras, os Robaiyat, se espelha e refugia a natureza profunda da Pérsia, dilacerada entre o jugo do invasor e o fanatismo de um dos mais radicais avatares do xiismo, então nascente com autêntica feição nacional: a seita dos Assassinos.Na segunda parte, redigida num tom onde a ironia se casa frequentemente com a amargura, narram-se as tentativas de afirmação nacional e democrática do povo persa, agora, no começo do século XX, sob o mando absoluto da dinastia autóctone dos Cajares, aliada às potências europeias, mormente a Rússia e a Inglaterra. Tentativas frustradas, porquanto norteadas por valores ocidentais, de cunho excessivamente nacionalista e empírico, alheios à tradição espiritual persa.Em jeito de alegoria final e símbolo deste malogro, o Manuscrito de Samarcanda, que encerra os poemas escritos pelo próprio punho de Omar Khayyam. Irá afundar-se no Atlântico, enclaustrado no interior do Titanic, irrisório e trágico, florão da técnica ocidental. Ao ocultamento de tão perene rosto da Pérsia, seguir-se-á o desaparecimento da princesa Chirine, encantadora personagem feminina, guardiã da alma da sua nação e ao mesmo tempo anunciadora de um ressurgimento vindouro, de uma nova era em que o velho e o novo, o nocturno e o diurno, o visível e o invisível se caldearão para restituir à Pérsia a sua genuína face.Samarcanda é a Pérsia de Ornar Khayyam, poeta do vinho, livre-pensador, astrónomo de génio, mas também a de Hassan Sabbah, fundador da seita dos Assassinos, a mais temível da História.Samarcanda é o Oriente do século XIX e do dealbar do século XX, viagem num universo onde os sonhos de liberdade sempre souberam desafiar os fanatismos.Samarcanda é a aventura de um manuscrito nascido no século XI, perdido por ocasião das invasões mongóis e reencontrado seis séculos mais tarde.Uma vez mais, conduzindo-nos pela Rota da Seda através das mais fascinantes urbes da Ásia, Amin Maalouf deslumbra-nos com o seu extraordinário talento de narrador.Na esteira de Edgar Allan Poe, diz-nos ele: «E agora passeia o teu olhar sobre Samarcanda! Não é deveras rainha da Terra? Altiva, acima de todas as cidades e nas mãos dela os seus destinos?»",9788461284948,9788461284948,Paperback,Biblioteca Sábado,300 pages,"

","In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career.  His body of work is arguable the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Here, Sidney Poitier explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure - as a man, as a husband, and father, and as an actor.Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.Here, finally, is Poitier's own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, pride and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man seeking truth, passion, and balance in the face of limits his own and the world's. A triumph of the spirit, The Measure of a Man captures the essential Poitier.Author Biography: Sidney Poitier was the first and remains the only African American actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his outstanding performance in Lilies of the Field in 1963, but he believes that will soon change, given the excellence of African-American talent in the industry today. He has starred in over forty films, directed nine, and written four. His landmark films include TheDefiant Ones, A Patch of Blue, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and To Sir, With Love. Among his many accolades, he has recently been selected as the thirty-sixth recipient of the Screen Actors Guild's highest honor, the Life Achievement Award for an outstanding career and humanitarian accomplishment.",0061357901,9780061357909),Paperback,,243 pages,"

The subjects jostle for attention, from the aristocrat who made his fortune in the South Sea Bubble, to a baker struggling to turn a financial corner in the midst of a popular uprising in this present time. There are two boy heroes, and a fluffy rabbit in a children's tale. There is a nun wondering if the picture in the attic is worth anything. The tales show the best and bravest of us and those we could well do without.

","The only reason Bria Sheridan was at the Springs resort was to save her grandmother from being swindled out of all her money. And the only reason she agreed to stay and give the place a chance was because she loved her grandmother. That and…she didn’t really have any other place to go. In fact, if she didn’t turn in a killer photo assignment, she’d lose her job completely. Head chef for the resort, Jax Carver never stays in one place very long, and it’s about time he thought about moving on again, especially since he’s starting to care about the people he’s met in Cedar Springs. But before he goes, he might as well help the dark haired, beauty who clearly has a chip on her shoulder that he’d love to knock off. Bria needs a photo spread that will save her career and Jax can help her get it. What she doesn’t need is the undeniable attraction between them, unless of course they can both keep it casual with no expectations. And that’s a lot to gamble on, especially since neither of them are counting on having any real feelings. But when those feelings are put to the test, will their connection be strong enough to save them? Or will the chance for love be lost for good?",//<![CDATA[,Combine,ebook,,,"

Everyone has Secrets. 




PRAGUE, 1870.
After joining the Order of the Crystal Daggers, led by her dauntless grandmother, Lady Penelope, Eleanora Svobodová set out to save her kingdom from oncoming devastation.And she failed. Following the attack on Prague Castle, Eleanora is determined to redeem herself. She sets out to win Karl’s trust while distancing herself from Ferdy, whose secrets and lies have done nothing to stop her from falling in love with him. As she struggles to let him go, questions about the mission and her mother’s past cause a rift between Amir and Lady Penelope and add to the growing discord between Eleanora and her brother. But when a cunning provocateur arrives in Prague, Eleanora discovers there is an even more deadly game afoot, one that reaches into Amir's past and threatens Lady Penelope's future. Now, the members of the Order must work together if they are to uncover the true enemy hiding in Bohemia. Can they work together despite their divisions? Or will their division lead to even more destruction? 




FROM THE BOOK: 

“How do I know you’re telling me the truth?” The last thing I wanted to do was hurt him, but if I did not find a way to break free of him, I would risk doing even more harm. Ferdy met my gaze with his. “I promise you this, Ella, that as of now, I will never lie to you again.” He leaned forward and kissed me again, and I stood there, letting him, desperately debating whether I could trust him or not. His promise burned through me, his words scorched into my being. It was so tempting to believe him, more tempting than anything else I had ever faced in all my life. Freedom was only freedom if I could trust it to be true. 






FROM THE AUTHOR: 
With spies, secrets, and suspense, Prince of Secrets and Shadows is the second book in The Order of the Crystal Daggers, a spy adventure series from me, C. S. Johnson. 







WHAT REVIEWERS ARE SAYING:

","Commissioned and closely monitored by Milan Kundera himself, this new translation brings a clarity and unmatched fidelity to the author's original text. Widely held as a work of genius, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting is the novel that first brought him to the forefront of the international literary scene. Rich in stories, characters and imaginative range, it was written while Kundera was still forbidden to publish in his home country of Czechoslovakia, which was then behind the Iron Curtain. In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of modern existence from the posthumous erasure of ""enemies"" of communism from the historical record, to the subtle agony of the fading memory of a lost love, to the bizarre sexlessnes of modern promiscuity are explored with boldness, subversive humor and the magical power of fiction.",0140096930,9780140096934),Paperback,Revised,237 pages,"

","A series of murders in New York City has stymied the police and FBI alike, and they suspect the culprit is a single killer sending an indecipherable message. But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case.Special Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliché: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer.Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again – this time at them. Now on the run, trying to track down a man who has focused on killing his pursuers, Grady and Garrett will have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife.",B001H0GCRM,B001H0GCRM,Kindle Edition,,376 pages,"

After ten years, he’s still an egg vendor. The equation should be: “HARD WORK PLUS GOAL equals SUCCESS.”If you don’t have goals in life, you move about like a butterfly.  Butterflies fly so erratically you wonder where do they really want to go.

","Ruby vuole solo dimenticare. Vuole solo cancellare l'ultimo anno al Tarble College e nascondere nel profondo quel segreto che non ha confessato a nessuno. Eppure, quando crede che il peggio sia alle spalle si ritrova tra le mani il libro da cui tutto è cominciato. Il libro che custodisce le ombre del suo passato. È all'interno di una valigia: il bagaglio di Beth, una compagna di college che da pochi giorni è scomparsa. Ruby non poteva immaginare che Una stanza tutta per sé di Virginia Woolf riuscisse ancora a toccare le note più recondite della sua anima. A riportarla faccia a faccia con le sue paure. Ma lei è l'unica a conoscere il suo fascino oscuro. Tra quelle pagine ha visto crescere un'ossessione per le scrittrici suicide, donne fragili che si sono abbandonate al gesto più estremo. Un'ossessione che giorno dopo giorno l'ha avvicinata sempre più a Mark, il suo professore di letteratura. Eppure Ruby non può lasciare che quest'incubo si impadronisca di nuovo di lei, proprio ora che Beth è sparita. Deve cercarla. La ragazza sa che c'è solo un luogo che racchiude tutte le risposte. L'ultimo posto in cui vorrebbe tornare: Tarble, la sua università. Lì dove ha imparato che ciò che conta è essere i migliori, a qualunque prezzo. Lì dove misteriosi tentativi di suicidio le parlano di un destino a cui è difficile sfuggire. Lì dove, nel silenzio degli antichi e bui corridoi, ogni traccia riconduce a quel libro su cui c'è ancora molto da svelare. Perché dietro un animo fragile può celarsi un grande coraggio e dietro un amore innocente qualcuno che colpisce dove fa più male.",8811686970,9788811686972),Hardcover,Narratori moderni,288 pages,"

","With striking originality and precision, Eden Robinson, the Giller-shortlisted author of the classic Monkey Beach  and winner of the Writers Trust Engel/Findley Award, blends humour with heartbreak in this compelling coming-of-age novel. Everyday teen existence meets indigenous beliefs, crazy family dynamics, and cannibalistic river otter . . . The exciting first novel in her trickster trilogy.Everyone knows a guy like Jared: the burnout kid in high school who sells weed cookies and has a scary mom who's often wasted and wielding some kind of weapon. Jared does smoke and drink too much, and he does make the best cookies in town, and his mom is a mess, but he's also a kid who has an immense capacity for compassion and an impulse to watch over people more than twice his age, and he can't rely on anyone for consistent love and support, except for his flatulent pit bull, Baby Killer (he calls her Baby)--and now she's dead. Jared can't count on his mom to stay sober and stick around to take care of him. He can't rely on his dad to pay the bills and support his new wife and step-daughter. Jared is only sixteen but feels like he is the one who must stabilize his family's life, even look out for his elderly neighbours. But he struggles to keep everything afloat...and sometimes he blacks out. And he puzzles over why his maternal grandmother has never liked him, why she says he's the son of a trickster, that he isn't human. Mind you, ravens speak to him--even when he's not stoned. You think you know Jared, but you don't.",English,English,Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","First published in 1922, The Beautiful and the Damned followed Fitzgerald's impeccable debut, This Side of Paradise, thus securing his place in the tradition of great American novelists. Embellished with the author's lyrical prose, here is the story of Harvard-educated, aspiring aesthete Anthony Patch and his beautiful wife, Gloria. As they await the inheritance of his grandfather's fortune, their reckless marriage sways under the influence of alcohol and avarice. A devastating look at the nouveau riche and New York nightlife, as well as the ruinous effects of wild ambition, The Beautiful and the Damned achieved stature as one of Fitzgerald's most accomplished novels. Its distinction as a classic endures to this day. Pocket Book's Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader.

","Teen advocate and trailblazer Jazz Jennings—named one of “The 25 Most Influential Teens” of the year by Time—shares her very public transgender journey, as she inspires people to accept the differences in others while they embrace their own truths.   “[Jazz’s] touching book serves as a rallying cry for understanding and acceptance.”—Bustle   Jazz Jennings is one of the youngest and most prominent voices in the national discussion about gender identity. At the age of five, Jazz transitioned to life as a girl, with the support of her parents. A year later, her parents allowed her to share her incredible journey in her first Barbara Walters interview, aired at a time when the public was much less knowledgeable or accepting of the transgender community. This groundbreaking interview was followed over the years by other high-profile interviews, a documentary, the launch of her YouTube channel, a picture book, and her own reality TV series—I Am Jazz—making her one of the most recognizable activists for transgender teens, children, and adults.   In her remarkable memoir, Jazz reflects on these very public experiences and how they have helped shape the mainstream attitude toward the transgender community. But it hasn’t all been easy. Jazz has faced many challenges, bullying, discrimination, and rejection, yet she perseveres as she educates others about her life as a transgender teen. Through it all, her family has been beside her on this journey, standing together against those who don't understand the true meaning of tolerance and unconditional love. Now Jazz must learn to navigate the physical, social, and emotional upheavals of adolescence—particularly high school—complicated by the unique challenges of being a transgender teen. Making the journey from girl to woman is never easy—especially when you began your life in a boy’s body.  PRAISE FOR JAZZ JENNINGS:   “Jazz is one of the transgender community's most important activists.”  —Cosmopolitan   “A role model for teens everywhere.” —Seventeen.com   “Wise beyond her years.” —Teen Vogue",B01AQNZQAY,B01AQNZQAY,Kindle Edition,,272 pages,"

","From the internationally bestselling author of No god but God comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth. Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the “Kingdom of God.” The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God. Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotry—a fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious “King of the Jews” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity. Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazareth’s life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion.",B00BRUQ7ZY,B00BRUQ7ZY,Kindle Edition,,336 pages,"

Right-wing evangelist Godwin Mann isn’t about to let that continue, and his intolerant brand of fundamentalism has struck a chord with the residents. But Mann goes too far when he descends into the pit where the ancient being who’s been worshipped by the Druids for centuries is said to dwell.What emerges is no longer Mann, but a demon in Mann’s shape, and only the town’s outcasts can see that something is horribly wrong. Slowly, as the evil spreads, Moonwell becomes cut off from the rest of the world. Telephone lines become disconnected. Roads no longer lead out of town.

"," Here is a new Loeb Classical Library edition of Homer's stirring heroic account of the Trojan war and its passions. The eloquent and dramatic epic poem captures the terrible anger of Achilles, ""the best of the Achaeans,"" over a grave insult to his personal honor and relates its tragic result--a chain of consequences that proves devastating for the Greek forces besieging Troy, for noble Trojans, and for Achilles himself. The poet gives us compelling characterizations of his protagonists as well as a remarkable study of the heroic code in antiquity.  The works attributed to Homer include the two oldest and greatest European epic poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad. These have been published in the Loeb Classical Library for three quarters of a century, the Greek text facing a faithful and literate prose translation by A. T. Murray. William F. Wyatt now brings the Loeb's Iliad up to date, with a rendering that retains Murray's admirable style but is written for today's readers.",Multiple,languages,Hardcover,"Loeb Classical Library, #170",608 pages,"

","James Madison - often called the Father of the Constitution - described as ""neither wholly national, nor wholly federal"". By this, Madison meant that the Constitution established both a strong central power and protected state's rights. But to say that something is of two parts is not to say that the parts are equal. Advocates of state sovereignty believed the Constitution created an executive power that was so strong it might as well have been a monarchy. But advocates of national government felt that a strong executive was essential to steer America through crisis. Between these two positions, the living body of the Constitution was sculpted. Over and over, the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention clashed and compromised. Slavery, a bill of rights, legislative representation - all the battles over these issues are enshrined in the language of the Constitution.

","The Dead Father is a gargantuan half-dead, half-alive, part mechanical, wise, vain, powerful being who still has hopes for himself--even while he is being dragged by means of a cable toward a mysterious goal. In this extraordinary novel, marked by the imaginative use of language that influenced a generation of fiction writers, Donald Barthelme offered a glimpse into his fictional universe. As Donald Antrim writes in his introduction, ""Reading The Dead Father, one has the sense that its author enjoys an almost complete artistic freedom . . . a permission to reshape, misrepresent, or even ignore the world as we find it . . . Laughing along with its author, we escape anxiety and feel alive.""",English,English,Paperback,,177 pages,"

","As the child of African American and Native American parents, Kaylynn TwoTrees grew up hearing herself called ""half breed"" and ""mixed blood, "" terms which now, after many transforming experiences, have positive and powerful meanings for her. This book spanning the first fifty years of her life is the account of her extraordinary journey into an understanding of her rich and complex heritage. Her poignant, honest memoir tells of her birth to a Lakota father from a South Dakota reservation and a black mother from an urban neighborhood in Des Moines. She spent summers during her early childhood visiting the Pine Ridge reservation. Her grandmother's teachings from those days sustained her throughout the subsequent years. After the murder of her mother, Kaylynn was adopted by her black grandparents, who had worked to achieve a middle-class life. She was later sent to a Roman Catholic boarding school where she was the only person of color. After she gave birth to a baby girl, whom she released to the care of relatives, she set out on her own. The ensuing journey took her from Chicago to a life in Europe, where she lived for several years as a dancer and a manager of dance companies. Returning to the United States, she lived first in New York and then in the Southwest, where she has spent recent years absorbed by a study of the landscape and the indigenous cultures and by performances and workshops. In this candid account of self-discovery she details a life journey filled with both exhilarating and painful moments and an understanding of the diverse strands of her multi-cultural identity. Always carrying with her the love and the lessons from her Indian grandmother and many others, she hascome to understand the value of her multiple heritages.",0878059814,9780878059812),Hardcover,,166 pages,"

","Religion is one of the oldest human activities and even in the present day pervades almost every aspect of life, but with so many seemingly incomprehensible beliefs, laws, rituals, and terminologies, you can't tell the players without a program. The Joy of Sects overcomes this confusion by presenting a rich trove of information in a concise, browsable format. It is a guidebook to the world's religious traditions not only for the devout follower but also for the interested outsider, for the curious unbeliever, and for anyone who ever wondered about the difference between karma and dharma, yin and yang, Talmud and Torah, the astral plane and the akashic record, Pharisees and Sadducees, Sunnis and Shiites.Here you will find detailed narrative histories of the six great religious traditions of East and West -- Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam -- along with information about related traditions, including Sikhism, Confucianism, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, and the various elements that compose the New Age. Each chapter contains brief sections on the scriptures, places of worship, and terminologies, as well as the numerous denominations, orders, and schools that make up the great millefleur tapestry of world religion.",0385425651,9780385425650),Paperback,,656 pages,"

What she doesn't know is that this same spirit appeared to leaders of the Jumano Native American tribe in New Mexico 362 years earlier, and was linked to a Spanish nun capable of powers of ""bilocation,"" or the ability to be in two places simultaneously.

Hood—an accomplished novelist—was unable to read or write. She could only reflect on her lost daughter—“the way she looked splashing in the bathtub ... the way we sang ‘Eight Days a Week.’” One day, a friend suggested she learn to knit. Knitting soothed her and gave her something to do. Eventually, she began to read and write again. A semblance of normalcy returned, but grief, in ever new and different forms, still held the family. What they could not know was that comfort would come, and in surprising ways.

","Cassidy Shea's life was nothing if not serene. Loving parents and a doting brother provided happiness and innocent hope as life's experience. Yes-life was blissful at Cassidy's beloved home-Terrill. Still, for all Terrill's beauty and tranquility, ever there was something intangible and evasive lurking in the shadows. And though Cassidy wasted little worry on it, still she sensed its existence-looming as a menacing fate bent on ruin. And when a dark stranger appeared, Cassidy could no longer ignore the ominous whispers of the secrets surrounding her. Mason Carlisle, an angry, unpredictable man, materialized-with Cassidy's black fate at his heels. Thus, thrust into a world completely unknown to her, Cassidy found herself trapped-wandering in a labyrinth of mystery and concealments. Serenity was vanquished-and with it her dreams. Yet, were the secrets so cautiously kept from Cassidy-were they indeed the cloth, the very flax from which her dreams were spun-from which eternal bliss would be woven?",0982192142,9780982192146),Paperback,,356 pages,"

Even Clare's good friend, police chief Russ Van Alstyne, is shaken by the brutality of the crimes-especially when it appears that the victims were chosen because they are gay. But when a third assault of an out-of-town developer ends in murder, Clare and Russ wonder if the recent crime wave is connected to the victim's controversial plan to open an upscale spa in Miller's Kill.

Malia is an activist who has lost faith in systemic reform, and Dujuan is a street thug torn by grief at his younger sister’s death. When Dujuan mugs Malia, she compares him to Vexcorp, triggering a storm inside him. That storm only clears when he identifies the real agent of his pain: Larry Gordon, Vexcorp’s CEO. Injury requires justice, so Dujuan kidnaps Gordon and presents him to Malia for judgment. As bystanders become involved and time runs out, Malia is forced to make grueling moral decisions between survival and loyalty, safety and courage, and agency and despair.",English,English,Paperback,,224 pages,"

Whether she is exploring the vital importance literature and language play in Native American heritage, illuminating the inseparability of the land and the Native American people, enlivening the ways and wisdom of the old-time people, or exploding in outrage over the government's long-standing, racist treatment of Native Americans, Silko does so with eloquence and power, born from her profound devotion to all that is Native American. Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit is written with the fire of necessity. Silko's call to be heard is unmistakable; there are stories to remember, injustices to redress, ways of life to preserve.

","The Children is Halberstam's moving evocation of the early days of the civil rights movement, as seen thru the story of the young people--the Children--who met in the 60s & went on to lead the revolution. Magisterial in scope, with a strong you-are-there quality, The Children is a story one of America's preeminent journalists has waited years to write, a powerful book about one of the most dramatic movements in American history. They came together as part of Rev. James Lawson's workshops on nonviolence, eight idealistic black students whose families had sacrificed much so that they could go to college. They risked it all, & their lives besides, when they joined the growing civil rights movement. Halberstam shows how Martin Luther King Jr recruited Lawson to come to Nashville to train students in Gandhian techniques of nonviolence. We see the strength of the families the Children came from, moving portraits of several generations of the black experience in America. We feel Diane Nash's fear before the first sit-in to protest segregation of Nashville lunch counters. Then we see how Diane Nash & others--John Lewis, Gloria Johnson, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, Curtis Murphy, James Bevel, Rodney Powell--persevered until they ultimately accomplished that goal. After the sit-ins, when the Freedom Rides to desegregate interstate buses were in danger of being stopped because of violence, it was these same young people who led the bitter battle into the Deep South. Halberstam takes us into those buses, lets us witness the violence the students encountered in Montgomery, Birmingham, Selma. He shows what has happened to the Children since the 60s, as they have gone on with their lives.",0449004392,9780449004395),Paperback,,785 pages,"

","By the bestselling author of Cutting for Stone, a story of medicine in the American heartland, and confronting one's deepest prejudices and fears. Nestled in the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee, the town of Johnson City had always seemed exempt from the anxieties of modern American life. But when the local hospital treated its first AIDS patient, a crisis that had once seemed an urban problem had arrived in the town to stay. Working in Johnson City was Abraham Verghese, a young Indian doctor specializing in infectious diseases. Dr. Verghese became by necessity the local AIDS expert, soon besieged by a shocking number of male and female patients whose stories came to occupy his mind, and even take over his life. Verghese brought a singular perspective to Johnson City: as a doctor unique in his abilities; as an outsider who could talk to people suspicious of local practitioners; above all, as a writer of grace and compassion who saw that what was happening in this conservative community was both a medical and a spiritual emergency.""",0679752927,9780679752929),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","The fourth of Joan Grant's ""Far Memory"" novels, Lord of the Horizon, set in Egypt at the close of the dark XIth Dynasty, is a profound commentary on the power of fear and the unlimited ability of light to shatter it. It is the sequel to Eyes of Horus.Lord of the Horizon is the story, told in the first person, of Ra-ab, heir to the Nomarch of the Oryx. Ra-ab is twenty-one as the story begins. The dawn for which Ra-ab and the Watchers of the Horizon fought in Eyes of Horus has come, but to 'Send Fear into Exile', as the Watchers' password promised, proves difficult. The new Pharaoh, Amenemhet, marries the daughter of the Pharaoh he deposed, thereby enabling her mother, a Babylonian by birth, to retain influence. Like a spider, she spins a web of intrigue and manipulation which threatens to plunge Egypt back into darkness. Her prize is Amenemhet's son Senusert, who will one day be Pharaoh himself. Finally, Pharaoh realizes what has occurred, and calls on his friend Ra-ab Hotep, hero of the revolution, to take Senusert to his home in the Oryx and help him grow up properly, so he will be ready to fulfill his duties as Pharaoh. But the Babylonian is not yet defeated. She continues to challenge Amenemhet's rule and authority, leading inexorably to the final showdown.As a child growing up in Edwardian England, Joan Grant became aware of an astonishing ability to remember previous lifetimes, and as an author professed her seven novels to be based on her personal recollections of other incarnations, male and female, in ancient civilisations.""Ra'ab, the Warrior, heir of the Peace of God... speaks with a voice that those who today are seeking illumination may welcome as the voice of a friend.""

","Can nature make us happy? How can we know anything? What is justice? Why is there evil in the world? What is the source of truth? Is it possible for God not to exist? Can we really believe what we see? There are questions that have intrigued the world's great thinkers over the ages, which still touch a chord in all of us today. They are questions that can teach us about the way we live, work, relate to each other and see the world. Here Leszek Kolakowski explores the essence of these ideas, introducing figures from Socrates to Thomas Aquinas, Descartes to Nietzsche, and concentrating on one single important philosophical question from each of them. Whether reflecting on good and evil, truth and beauty, faith and the soul, or free will and consciousness, Leszek Kolakowski shows that these timeless ideas remain at the very core of our existence.",071399925X,9780713999259),,,,,"['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Writing', 'Essays', 'History']"

","En su segundo viaje al continente africano, Javier Reverte recorrió Sudáfrica, Zimbabue, Tanzania, Ruanda y Congo para dejarnos un nuevo y estremecedor relato sobre el misterio de África y el riesgo de viajar por territorios inseguros.Las innumerables batallas libradas en Sudáfrica, el genocidio ruandés de 1994 o los horrores sufridos en Congo cuando era casi una finca personal del rey Leopoldo II de Bélgica son algunos de los hechos históricos que recorre el autor con una prosa dura y hermosa, épica y lírica a la vez, que concluye de forma brillante con la navegación por las aguas del gigantesco río Congo.Vagabundo en África es un libro que se lee como una novela, lleno de pasión, y que al mismo tiempo nos habla sobre los oscuros laberintos del alma humana. Es, también, un canto a la fe en el hombre, porque, en palabras del propio autor, «donde hay un deseo, hay un camino».",849550118X,9788495501189),Paperback,,478 pages,"

","The Darling Buds of May, which came out in 1958, was the first of five Larkin novels and in it readers witness the transformation of Mr. Charlton from a undernourished and timid tax clerk to ‘Charlie’, a fully-converted member of the Larkin way of life: an easygoing celebration of nature, food, drink, and family. In the process, the reader is introduced to the Brigadier, Miss Pilchester, and Angela Snow. Setting the style for the series, the book ends with a grand celebration, and the announcement of the wedding of Charlie and Mariette. The novel was filmed with the title ‘The Mating Game’, and between 1991 and 1993, Yorkshire Television produced a highly-successful television series called ‘The Darling Buds of May’. This first book in the Larkin series was very successful, appearing first in the United States and then in Britain, where it sold 40,000 in the first two months. Many critics felt that Bates deserved better than to be remembered mostly for the Larkin novels, but they were very profitable. The immensely popular Larkin series of comic novels consisted of ‘The Darling Buds of May’, ‘A Breath of French Air’ (1959), ‘When the Green Woods Laugh’ (1960), ‘Oh! To Be in England’ (1963), and ‘A Little of What You Fancy’ (1970). Bates, speaking of how he was inspired to create the Larkins, recalled the real junkyard that he often passed near his home in Kent; and he remembered seeing a family -- a father, mother and many children, sucking at ice-creams and eating crisps in a ""ramshackle lorry that had been recently painted a violent electric blue"". He tried writing a brief tale based on the family, but soon decided that he couldn’t waste such a rich gallery of characters to a short story."" Pop is a wonderful character who hates pomp, pretension and humbug; loves his family, but doesn’t hesitate to break a few rules... and his and the Larkins' secret is “that they live as many of us would like to live if only we had the guts and nerve to flout the conventions.""

During one special year, he became the only one in the neighborhood who could throw a perfect knuckleball. It was a pitch you could not hit. That same year, Jake learned there are also some things you cannot hold.  Patricia MacLachlan, one of the most beloved children's book authors writing today, has painted a deeply stirring, delicately lyrical portrait of a child, a son, a family, and a brother.

","Believing that her French guardian is about to abandon her to an orphanage in the city, ten-year-old Lucky runs away from her small town with her beloved dog by her side in order to trek across the Mojave Desert in this Newbery Medal–winning novel from Susan Patron.Lucky, age ten, can't wait another day. The meanness gland in her heart and the crevices full of questions in her brain make running away from Hard Pan, California (population 43), the rock-bottom only choice she has. It's all Brigitte's fault -- for wanting to go back to France. Guardians are supposed to stay put and look after girls in their care! Instead Lucky is sure that she'll be abandoned to some orphanage in Los Angeles where her beloved dog, HMS Beagle, won't be allowed. She'll have to lose her friends Miles, who lives on cookies, and Lincoln, future U.S. president (maybe) and member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers. Just as bad, she'll have to give up eavesdropping on twelve-step anonymous programs where the interesting talk is all about Higher Powers. Lucky needs her own -- and quick. But she hadn't planned on a dust storm. Or needing to lug the world's heaviest survival-kit backpack into the desert.",1416901949,9781416901945),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

","All words fell away. I pushed myself off the path, noticing for the first time the signs of earlier passage—the matted earth, broken twigs. And I knew. My mouth turned cottony. I licked my lips, took three halting steps. My maddening, visual brain churned out pictures of colorless faces on a cold slab—Debbie Lille, victim number one; Wanda Deminger, number three . . . He’d been here. Dragged this one right where I now stumbled. I’d entered a crime scene, and I could not bear to see what lay at the end. . . . This is a story about evil. This is a story about God’s power. A string of murders terrorizes citizens in the Redding, California, area. The serial killer is cunning, stealthy. Masked by day, unmasked by night. Forensic artist Annie Kingston discovers the sixth body practically in her own back yard. Is the location a taunt aimed at her? One by one, Annie must draw the unknown victims for identification. Dread mounts. Who will be taken next? Under a crushing oppression, Annie and other Christians are driven to pray for God’s intervention as they’ve never prayed before. With page-turning intensity, Dead of Night dares to pry open the mind of evil. Twisted actions can wreak havoc on earth, but the source of wickedness lies beyond this world. Annie learns where the real battle takes place—and that a Christian’s authority through prayer is the ultimate, unyielding weapon.",0310251052,9780310251057),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","When you wake up in the morning and your eyes take in the first hints of light that shine through your window, the dust motes catching and reflecting the sun’s rays like little diamonds, the shimmering hues of yellow and orangey gold breaking through into your room, the first thing you think about usually isn’t how you’re going to make it through the worst day of your life.Unfortunately for Grace Shelley, that’s exactly what she’s facing as she ponders what to do now that she’s going to be starting out her last year in high school without her best friend. She’s not exactly the most popular girl in school - well, not the most popular girl in school to like, anyway - and everything seems to be hinting at another status quo year for her until she bumps into a stranger who leaves her stumbling for words and chasing after her heart.The new guy in school is different. Robert doesn’t care about the rumors he’s heard about her or that no one else seems to see her the same way that he does; he only wants to be her friend. That’s when things get complicated. When Grace learns that he’s not your typical high school boy and that he’s actually a wingless angel who’s looking for someone to trust, she’s thrust into his world where not all angels are meant to protect human beings, and where the changes she brings into his life changes everything in hers.",B002WC99NS,B002WC99NS,Kindle Edition,,474 pages,"

He had never tried to shoot anything bigger than a fool bird or rabbit with it and doubted that the bow would push the arrow deep enough to do anything but -- again -- make the bear really mad.

","In Egyptian mythology, Iai is th rebel, the tester, the stubborn resisting force of intellect and insight which donkey-like stands its ground, refusing to budge, and challenges what is accepted and valued and thought to be sensible and true. This book is a portrait of one artist as sublime Rebel. Fortunately, it doesnt have to be a ""Best of"" collection (though it does contain much of his finest work). Rather, it is a sound representation, ""warts and all,"" of the writing of someone who is perfectly, vigorously, cast as the Iai of his age. Though Harlan's work is widely known and applauded, not enough is made of the sense of social responsibility that is central to it. In fact, this dimension often seems to be deliberately overlooked and the major thrust of his fantasy trivialized. He deals in ideas, sometimes so full of love and compassion that they stun with their simple honesty; sometimes set with barbs and hooks that catch and tear and make us gasp and make us feel. Dr. Johnson would have been proud. Shakespeare would have smiled fondly. Because that's the dimension of achievement occurring here. Ellison is as close to the pulse of his age as Chaucer and Shakespeare and Dickens ever came to theirs.",0962344745,9780962344749),Paperback,,1015 pages,"

","Isabel Allende's first memory of Chile is of a house she never knew. The ""large old house"" on the Calle Cueto, where her mother was born and which her grandfather evoked so frequently that Isabel felt as if she had lived there, became the protagonist of her first novel, The House of the Spirits. It appears again at the beginning of Allende's playful, seductively compelling memoir My Invented Country, and leads us into this gifted writer's world.Here are the almost mythic figures of a Chilean family -- grandparents and great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends -- with whom readers of Allende's fiction will feel immediately at home. And here, too, is an unforgettable portrait of a charming, idiosyncratic Chilean people with a violent history and an indomitable spirit. Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- ""I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me"" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland. In My Invented County, she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.Two life-altering events inflect the peripatetic narration of this book: The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on her newly adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. My Invented Country, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author's past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants, and to all of us, who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.",006054564X,9780060545642),Hardcover,,199 pages,"

","Viking marauders descend on a much-plundered island, hoping some mayhem will shake off the winter blahs. A man is booted out of his home after his wife discovers that the print of a bare foot on the inside of his windshield doesn’t match her own. Teenage cousins, drugged by summer, meet with a reckoning in the woods. A boy runs off to the carnival after his stepfather bites him in a brawl.In the stories of Wells Tower, families fall apart and messily try to reassemble themselves. His version of America is touched with the seamy splendor of the dropout, the misfit: failed inventors, boozy dreamers, hapless fathers, wayward sons. Combining electric prose with savage wit, Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned is a major debut, announcing a voice we have not heard before.",0374292191,9780374292195),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","When the bombs fell and Western civilization ended, the residents of Hickory Hollow, Texas, scarcely noticed the difference. They were already used to fending for themselves—growing their own food, helping their neighbors survive, keeping their rural life going, much as before. But when the Ungers—a band of renegade thieves, murderers, and ne'er-do-wells—began raiding the nearby plots, looting and killing everyone in sight, it was time to take action!""I was reminded constantly of George R. Stewart's classic post-holocaust novel, Earth Abides. The gentle rhythms of country existence, the sense that the world will continue (with or without us), the joy of living close to the earth, the nature of community itself, all combine for a poignant tale celebrating the best of what it means to be human. In Mayhar's perceptive eyes, the World Begins in Hickory Hollow."" —Robert Reginald.",1434400247,9781434400246),Paperback,,172 pages,"

","The first edition of The Rhetoric of Fiction transformed the criticism of fiction and soon became a classic in the field. One of the most widely used texts in fiction courses, it is a standard reference point in advanced discussions of how fictional form works, how authors make novels accessible, and how readers recreate texts, and its concepts and terms—such as ""the implied author,"" ""the postulated reader,"" and ""the unreliable narrator""—have become part of the standard critical lexicon.For this new edition, Wayne C. Booth has written an extensive Afterword in which he clarifies misunderstandings, corrects what he now views as errors, and sets forth his own recent thinking about the rhetoric of fiction. The other new feature is a Supplementary Bibliography, prepared by James Phelan in consultation with the author, which lists the important critical works of the past twenty years—two decades that Booth describes as ""the richest in the history of the subject.""",0226065588,9780226065588),Paperback,Second Edition,552 pages,"

","Crackpots and left-wingers have talked about it for years, but no one with any real authority has ever considered it. It would be political suicide. But President Thomas Winston has taken the boldest and most bizarre step in the War on Drugs that the United States has ever seen. Vowing to make narcotics legal and to tax and regulate them to the brink of extinction, he intends to take the billions of dollars generated from their sale out of the hands of the drug cartels and move the money into the government's coffers. The conservatives and the Bible Belt are outraged. They swear they'll fight to the death to defeat the President's proposal and see him impeached. The drug lords laugh - they're sure decriminalization will never happen. But then important and respected figures begin to speak out in the media, guardedly supporting President Winston's ideas. Security at the White House is the tightest in its history as death threats pour in daily in ever-increasing numbers. Winston is not concerned. His men are handpicked, the best in the world. Nothing can get to him before he attends the International Drug Summit at The Hague. But they can get to Dr. John VanDuyne, Winston's personal physician and oldest friend, and the one man who can have an audience with the Chief Executive at any time. Someone has kidnapped the doctor's little girl and all he has to do to get her back is poison his best friend - the President of the United States.",0312862644,9780312862640),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","Inspired by “Mrs. Tolstoy and Mrs. Dostoevsky, whose biographies about their husbands have now been published in Prague,” Bohumil Hrabal decided to produce his own autobiographical work, ostensibly fiction, from his wife’s point of view. He would write, he said, “not a putdown about myself, but a little bit of how it all was, that marriage of ours, with myself as a jewel and adornment of our life together.” The task, taken up by such a rogue comic talent, could be nothing other than strangely delightful; and in In-House Weddings, the first of the trilogy that Hrabal produced, we meet the author through the eyes of his wife Eliska. She narrates his life from his upbringing in Nymburk through his work as a dispatcher in a train station and then in a scrap paper plant, his first publication, his trouble with the authorities, and his association with notable artists and authors such as Jiri Kolar, Vladimir Boudnik, and Arnost Lustig. Hrabal’s bohemian life was itself a source of great interest to the Czech public; transmuted here, it is even more compelling, a wry portrait of artistic life in postwar Eastern Europe and a telling reflection on how such a life might be recast in the light of literary brilliance.",0810124300,9780810124301),Paperback,,184 pages,"

Rough Riders, Book 12
In Sundance, Wyoming, you can’t throw a boot without hitting a McKay cowboy, so Ben McKay is used to fading into the background. Except on weekends, when he’s Bennett, imposing Dom at The Rawhide Club, surrounded by a bevy of female subs eager for the attention of his long…whip. As for the curvy brunette eying him from across the room? He’ll eat his Stetson if she's the experienced Domme she claims to be. Bennett offers her a deal—he’ll let her call the shots for one night. But the next night he gets to prove to her how freeing it'll be when he takes the reins. Ainsley Hamilton is amazed by how well Bennett read her every secret yearning during that one explosive weekend—and she's stunned when they come face to face in their everyday lives as rancher and new bank president. Now Ben’s urging her to explore her submissive side outside the club, and there’s something in his commanding gaze that makes it too easy to let him take control—of her desires and her pleasure. Can Ben help Ainsley overcome her fear that a relationship built on dark sexual appetites won’t survive the light of day? Warning: This book contains a lot of kinky sex. No, seriously, there's A LOT of kinky cowboy sex in this Rough Riders installment. You've been warned. ",B0068WH89U,B0068WH89U,Kindle Edition,,320 pages,"

","Emile Nelligan est le plus grand poète lyrique du Québec. Sa vie et son oeuvre se confondent dans la même fulgurance. Né à Montréal en 1879, marqué par Musset, Verlaine et Baudelaire, il écrivit des poèmes sur les paradis perdus de l'enfance, le visage consolateur de la femme, la nostalgie des pays inconnus dont le lointain désespère le désir. Cet écrivain du néant, cet "" hypocondriaque au front blêmi "", fut interné en 1899 et passa quarante-deux ans dans un asile, au coeur de l'universelle souffrance. Il meurt en 1941, et devient une légende, l'ange maudit de la poésie nord-américaine. ",2894060793,9782894060797),Paperback,,262 pages,"

","Jesse Stone has a problem no officer of the law likes to face: Dead bodies keep appearing, but clues do not. A man takes his dog out for a run on the beach, only to be discovered hours later - with two holes in his chest. A woman drives her Volvo to the store to do some grocery shopping, and is then found dead, her body crumpled behind her loaded shopping cart. A commuter takes a shortcut home from the train, and never makes it back to his house. Hunting down a serial killer is difficult and dangerous in any town, but in a town like Paradise, where the selectmen and the media add untold pressures, Jesse feels considerable heat. Already walking an emotional tightrope, he stumbles; he's spending too much time with the bottle, and with his ex-wife - neither of which helps him, or the case. And the harder these outside forces push against him, the more Jesse retreats into himself, convinced - despite all the odds - that it's up to him alone to stop the killing.",042519874X,9780425198742),Paperback,,336 pages,"

","BETROTHED is Book #6 in the Bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS. The series begins with TURNED (Book #1), which is now a free download!  In BETROTHED (Book #6 in the Vampire Journals), Caitlin and Caleb find themselves, once again, back in time—this time, in the London of 1599.  London in 1599 is a wild place, filled with paradoxes: while on the one hand it is an incredibly enlightened, sophisticated time, breeding playwrights like Shakespeare, on the other, it is also barbaric and cruel, with daily public executions, torture, and heads of prisoners impaled on spikes. It is also a time of superstition and grave public danger, with a lack of sanitation, and the Bubonic Plague spreading in the streets, carried by rats.  In this environment Caitlin and Caleb land, on the search for her father, for the third key, for the mythical shield that can save humankind. Their mission takes them through a whirlwind of London’s most amazing medieval architecture, through the British countryside’s most breathtaking castles. It takes them back into the heart of London, where they just might meet Shakespeare himself, and see one of his plays live. It brings them to a little girl, Scarlet, who just might become their daughter. And all the while, Caitlin’s love for Caleb deepens, as finally they are together—and as Caleb might just finally find the perfect time, and place, to propose to her.  Sam and Polly have traveled back, too, and as they find themselves stuck together on their own journey, their relationship deepens, as they each, despite themselves, can’t help feeling more deeply for each other.  But all is not well. Kyle has come back, too, as has his evil sidekick, Sergei, and they are both intent on destroying everything good in Caitlin’s life. It will be a race to the finish, as Caitlin is forced to make some of the hardest decisions of her life if she is to save everyone who is dear to her, save her relationship with Caleb—and try to make it out alive.  BETROTHED is Book #6 in the Vampire Journals (following TURNED, LOVED, BETRAYED, DESTINED and DESIRED), and yet it also stands alone as a self-contained novel. BETROTHED is nearly 70,000 words.  Books #7--#10 in the series are now also available! Morgan Rice's #1 Bestselling series THE SURVIVAL TRILOGY, a dystopian, post apocalyptic thriller, is now also available for sale. And Morgan Rice's #1 Bestselling fantasy series, THE SORCERER'S RING, comprising ten books (and counting) is now also available--beginning with Book #1, A QUEST OF HEROES, which is a FREE download!",B005TKRSTM,B005TKRSTM,Kindle Edition,,202 pages,"

","Indian Country is a sweeping, brave and compassionate story from one of our most acclaimed chroniclers of the Vietnam experience.Christian Starkmann follows his boyhood friend, an Ojibwa Indian called Bonny George, from the wilderness of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, where they roamed, hunted and fished in their youths, to the wilderness of Vietnam, where they serve as soldiers in the same platoon. After returning home from the war, his friend buried on the battlefield he left behind, Christian begins to make a life for himself. Yet years later, although he is happily married to June, a good-hearted social worker, and has two daughters, Christian is still fighting--with the searing memories of combat, with the paranoid visions that are clouding his marriage and threatening his career, and most of all with the ghost of Bonny George, who haunts his dreams and presses him to come to terms with a secret so powerful it could destroy everything he has built.",0375725105,9780375725104),Paperback,,432 pages,"

","When Opus Posthumous first appeared in 1957, it was an appropriate capstone to the career of one of the most important writers of the twentieth century. It included many poems missing from Stevens's Collected Poems, along with Stevens's characteristically inventive prose and pieces for the theater. Now Milton J. Bates, the author of the acclaimed Wallace Stevens: A Mythology of Self, has edited and revised Opus Posthumous to correct the previous edition's errors and to incorporate material that has come to light since original publication. A third of the poems and essays in this edition are new to the volume. The resulting book is an invaluable literary document whose language and insights are fresh, startling, and eloquent.",0679725342,9780679725343),Paperback,,352 pages,"

","One contemporary scholar and authority on Spurgeon says of this work: ""Next to Mr. Spurgeon's great literary work, The Treasury of David, we consider (these) Lectures to My Students his greatest single contribution to the Christian world. There is more practical wisdom, common sense and sage advice packed within these pages than with any other book of similar size, or content."" This complete and unabridged edition of Spurgeon's great work will make it possible for today's generation to appreciate Spurgeon's combination of discerning wit and refreshingly practical advice. Included in the twenty-eight chapters of this classic volume are lectures such as: - The Call to Ministry - The Preacher's Private Prayer - On the Choice of a Text - On the Voice - The Holy Spirit in Connection with Our Ministry - The Blind Eye and the Deaf Ear - On Conversion as Our Aim - Illustrations in Preaching As were all of Spurgeon's messages to his people, each of these lectures is Scripture-saturated and Christ-honoring.

The consort of some of Europe's most influential men, Gabrielle Cheney is determined to secure her future by winning the heart of Henry, the Huguenot king of Navarre. As his mistress, Gabrielle hopes she might one day become the power behind the French throne. But her plans are jeopardized by Captain Nicolas Remy, a devoted warrior whose love Gabrielle desires-and fears-above all. She will also incur the malevolence of the Dark Queen, Catherine de' Medici, whose spies and witch-hunters are legion, and who will summon the black arts to maintain her authority. With the lives of those she loves in peril, Gabrielle must rebel against her queen to fulfill a glorious destiny she has sacrificed everything to gain.Alive with vivid period detail and characters as vibrant as they are memorable, The Courtesan is a sweeping historical tale of dangerous intrigues, deep treachery, and one woman's unshakable resolve to honor her heart.",0345437977,9780345437976),Paperback,,560 pages,"

يعتبر هذا الكتاب عرضا جامعا لعلم جديد يدرس الإنسان في علاقته مع الحاسوب والحاسوب مع الإنسان وكيف يكون التفاعل بين الكيانين واحد طبيعي والآخر صناعي. إن كتاب ""علم الاجتماع الآلي ""هو عنوان الكتاب الصادر حديثا عن ""عالم المعرفة ""، وهي سلسلة شهرية يصدرها المجلس الوطني للثقافة والفنون والآداب بالكويت. الكتاب في 255 صفحة، هو عبارة عن مقاربة في علم الاجتماع العربي والاتصال عبر الحاسوب، لمؤلفه الدكتور ""علي محمد ميلاد بن رحومة""، وهو من مواليد مارس 1957 بطرابلس بليبيا، اختصاصي نظم الحاسوب وباحث في المعلوماتية والاجتماع الافتراضي، حاز على العديد من الدرجات منها الإجازة الدقيقة ودكتوراه في علم الاجتماع (مجال المعلوماتية) بموضوع الأطروحة: ""المنظومة التيكنو-اجتماعية للانترنيت "" جامعة الفاتح طرابلس ليبيا 2004.عمل في عدة شركات في مجال الحاسوب والتخطيط والمعلومات وله نشاط تدريسي وتدريبي نشر عددا من مساهماته الأدبية والفكرية في الصحف والمجلات المحلية والعربية وصدرت له كتب منها الانترنيت والمنظومة التيكنو-اجتماعية بحث تحليلي في الآلية والتقنية للانترنيت ونمذجة منظومتها الاجتماعية بيروت مركز دراسات الوحدة العربية 2002 - نقل وتوطين المعرفة التيكنولوجية في التنمية الصناعية... - مدخل يعتبر علم ""الاجتماع الآلي"" هو الذي يهتم بالحركة البشرية المرقمنة في العالم الافتراضي، حيث يتناول أسس ومبادئ وأصول العلم الذي يدرس الإنسان المرقمن. يجمع هذا العلم الجديد بين علوم الحاسوب وعلوم الاجتماع، حيث يهدف إلى بحث مسألة الاتصال عبر الحاسوب ونشوء ما يسميه الكاتب ""الاجتماعية الإنترنيتية""، إذ يتفاعل الإنسان مع الحاسوب وتحوله إلى إنسان رقمي افتراضي يعيش على الشبكة المعلوماتية ويتواصل مع أخيه الإنسان في كافة أنحاء عالمنا. فالحاسوب أصبح جزء رئيسيا في حياتنا اليومية وضروريا لمختلف العلوم والمعارف من أجل تحقيق النمو الحضاري. لدى يدعو المؤلف العالم العربي إلى البحث ومتابعة ما يكتب حول الشبكة الدولية للمعلومات من طرف مراكز البحوث والتطوير في دول غربية واليابان..كما يدعو الدول العربية إلى تشجيع البحث العلمي التكنولوجي والاجتماعي لتحقيق التنمية. - نشوء ميدان البحث يعود المؤلف إلى منتصف التسعينيات حيث ظهرت أولى خطوات حقل معرفي جديد للدراسة والبحث وسرعان ما تطور وتقدم بأسماء مختلفة فنجد مثلا: دراسات الثقافة السايبرية والاتصال عبر الحاسوب ودراسات الإنترنت والمعلوماتية الاجتماعية، وفي عام 1996 عقدت في النمسا ندوة حول الفضاء السايبري: النظريات والمجازات بهدف فهم تأثيرات النمو المتزايد لشبكات الحواسيب الكونية كالإنترنت وشبكة الويب العالمية من اجل تطوير نماذج لتطوير هذه الشبكات وكيف ستؤثر في الأفراد والمجتمع على كل المستويات. ولقد كان التركيز على موضوعات السبرانية كنظرية اتصالات ومعلومات وتحكم يمكن تطبيقها في بناء النماذج المادية للشبكات مع الأخذ في الاعتبار منظورات علم الاجتماع وعلم المستقبليات والذكاء الاصطناعي والنظم المعقدة وتفاعل الإنسان مع الحاسوب وعلم النفس. و يخلص الكتاب في تعريفه بعلم الاجتماع الآلي إلى انه العلم الذي تندرج تحته أبحاث تخصصية مثل علم اجتماع التكنولوجيا وعلم اجتماع تكنولوجيا المعلومات، وعلم اجتماع المعلوماتية، والمعلوماتية الاجتماعية، وعلم اجتماع الإنترنت، وعلم اجتماع الويب، والدراسات السايبرية ودراسات الإنترنت، وبشكل اخص علم الاجتماع الإلكتروني وعلم الاجتماع الرقمي وعلم الاجتماع السايبري وعلم الاجتماع الافتراضي - الإنسوب ومجتمع الحاسوب لقد أصبحت البشرية تعيش في وسط جديد، وسط الاتصال الإلكتروني (الإنترنت) حتى تحول الإنسان الطبيعي إلى إنسان-آلة أو إنسان-حاسوب أو ما يسميه المؤلف ""الإنسوب"" وهي اختصار لكلمة ""الإنساسوب"" (الإنسان- الحاسوب) دلالة على برنامج ذكي أو واقع افتراضي، إنه "" مركب رقمي، لا جسد له، بل ذات- مجتمع، قد يكون مجرد برنامج حاسوب أو فرعا من برنامج"". إن علم الاجتماع الآلي يتفرع إلى علم اجتماع الوسط المجتمعي الجديد (وسط الإنترنت، فضاء سايبيري...)، ""إنه الفضاء الآلي الذي يحوينا شكلا ومضمونا فنكون كما ينبغي لنا أن نكون في عصر المعلومات، ومجتمع المعرفة، افرادا وجماعات ومنظمات رقمية، مرقمنين مبنى ومعنى..."". ... كما يحاول المؤلف في الفصل الأول أن يدرس مجتمع الحاسوب حيث يبين للقراء كيف أصبح الحاسوب جزء مهم في حياتنا اليومية، حيث "" تربع الحاسوب على عجلة القيادة الحضارية (المدنية)، فنحن لا نستطيع أن نقود من دون بصماته في أصابعناـ وإيحاءاته في أفكارنا وأحاسيسنا، ولا نستطيع حتى رؤية الحياة الراهنة من دون عينه، تضئ ما اظلم علينا في سابق الزمان، وسالف العصر والألوان"". - المجتمعات الافتراضية ""بديلا"" عن المكان الثالث يتطرق علم الاجتماع الحديث إلى ضياع مفهوم المجتمع المحلي الذي ضاع في خضم تحولات التحديث المجتمعات الغربية، حيث أصبح ما يسمى ""المكان الثالث"" شبه غائبا. وهو ما يسمى بالأمكنة الاجتماعية لتي يرتاح فيها الناس من الأعباء اليومية (النوادي، المقاهي...) وهي ضرورية لتحقيق الترابط الاجتماعي. ... يشير المؤلف إلى تراجع ""المكان الثالث"" في المجتمعات الغربية الحديثة، الأمر الذي جعل المجتمعات على الخط (الإنترنت) تلقى القبول لدى مستخدمي الشبكة، "" في "" أمكنة ثالثة"" رقمية؛ مثل غرفة الدردشة، جماعات الأخبار، البريد الإلكتروني..."". و يبحث الكاتب في الفصلين الثالث والرابع مفهوم المجتمعات الافتراضية، حيث يبين كيف انتشرت ""المجتمعات على الخط "" ونجحت في إشباع الحاجات الاجتماعية للإنسان (التعارف، التواصل مع الآخر...) لقد ساهمت تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات في تطوير المجتمعات المتنوعة لشبكات الحواسب المختلفة، على المستوى الاجتماعي ولتفاعلي الثقافي والتجاري والاتصالي بأنواعه المتنوعة (البريد الإلكتروني، الدردشة...). - الاتصال وبنية المجتمع على الخط في الفصل الخامس يناقش تقنيات الاتصال وبنية المجتمع على الخط، بعناصره الاجتماعية التي يتركب من مكوناتها البناء الافتراضي للجماعات الرقمية. ويعرض أهم مراحل التطوير والتقييم التي تمر بها الحركة الإلكترونية للمجتمعات الشبكية..وفي الأخير يتناول أهم الوسائل المستخدمة في الاتصال عبر الحاسوب، مبرزا ميزات وعيوب كل تكنلوجيا (قوائم البريد، جماعات الأخبار، الدردشة النصية، البريد الإلكتروني المدونات..). - الثقافة الرقمية يتطرق الكاتب إلى ما يسمى ب""النظرية السايبرية"" Cyber Theory التي ترتكز على وجود الفضاء الافتراضي كحقيقة لها أبعادها المختلفة في الإنترنت، حيث يعتبر ""الفضاء السايبيري مجالا رقميا إلكترونيا، يوجد داخل مسافات متشابكة من خطوط وقنوات الاتصالات المعدنية والضوئية والهوائية في الانترنت (...) ومن خلال هذا الفضاء، يحدث التفاعل البشري الآلي عقليا، ونفسيا، واجتماعيا، بمختلف الحواس الإنسانية وكذلك الآلية"". في هذا الفضاء أيضا يتشكل مجتمع الإنترنت، متكونا من أعضائه الكونيين، الأفراد الجماعات البشريين في علاقاتهم بعضهم ببعض، بمختلف الخصائص التي تفرضها هذه البيئة الإنسانية الآلية."" كلمة «النظريّة السايبريّة» Cybertheory مشتقة من الكلمة الإنكليزية المستعملة لوصف فضاء الإنترنت: «سايبر سبايس» Cyberspace، أما الكلمة («سايبر») التي صاغها الروائي ""ويليام غبسون""، فقد وضعها حين بحث عن اسم ما لوصف رؤيته عن شبكة حاسوب كونيّة تربط الناس والآلات ومصادر المعلومات، والتي من خلالها يمكن المرء أن يتحرّك كأنه يبحر في فضاء افتراضي... ... وتُشتق الكلمة «سايبر» cyber من الفعل اليوناني «كيبرنو» kubernao الذي يعني «يقود»أي ""يحكم""، وتطلق «السبرانيّة» Cybernetics اسما لعلم الاتصالات والمعلومات والتحكّم؛ وبالتالي تشمل كلمة "" السايبري "" معنيين: «الملاحة» navigation خلال فضاء من البيانات الإلكترونيّة، إضافة إلى التحكّم Control الذي يتحقّق عبر معالجة تلك البيانات. ... يحتوي الفضاء السايبري ""علماً رقميّاً من صنع الإنسان""، يستطيع استيعاب مختلف موارد المعلومات المتاحة من خلال شبكات الحواسيب. ويرسم صورة عن ثقافة رقميّة، تتحرك ضمن بيئة تفاعلية يصنعها مستخدمو الإنترنت ببرامجهم المتنوعة. ويلاحظ الكتاب أن كل مجتمع يطوّر ثقافته الافتراضية الخاصّة بسبب عوامل عديدة (ديموغرافيا المشاركين واهتماماتهم المشتركة، والطريقة التقنيّة لإعداد الشبكة المستخدمة، وكذلك نوعية برامج الحاسوب التي يميل إليها الجمهور...). كما يؤكد المؤلف على أن ""الفضاء السايبري يتيح فرصة تمثل مختلف أنواع الهويات، بشتى خلفياتها الاجتماعية والثقافية والعرقية...إذ يتشكل المجتمع السايبري في أي مساحة إلكترونية بصورة متوزعة، على أكبر نطاق ممكن في شكل لامركزي، ويتجاوز بذلك المشاركون عوائق الاتصال الحدودية تقنيا واجتماعيا"" فيتجاوزون موانع دواتهم لإبراز مواهبهم وطاقاتهم الشخصية... - نحو بحث اجتماعي آلي رصين يشير الدكتور محمد رحومة إلى بعض الاعتبارات التي على الباحثين أن يهتموا بها بغرض القيام بالبحث السايبيري على الإنترنت، كما يتطرق في الفصل السابع إلى عدد من المناهج البحثية والأساليب العملية التي يمكن اتباعها لإجراء بحوث الإنترنت، بهدف اكتشاف المجتمعات الافتراضية ودراستها مع الإشارة إلى أهم الوسائل الإلكترونية المستخدمة في البحث العلمي. العلوم الاجتماعية العلوم الاجتماعية http://hamdisocio.blogspot.com العلوم الاجتماعية...للدراسات والأبحاث الاجتماعية، ومقالات علم الاجتماع والخدمة الاجتماعية، وعلم النفس والفلسفة، وباقي فروع العلوم الاجتماعية الأخرى. علوم اجتماعية, علم اجتماع، خدمة اجتماعية، علم نفس، فلسفة، انثروبولوجيا,، تدريب ميداني، مقالات، أبحاث، دراسات، رسائل، ماجستير، دكتوراه، كتب علمية، نظريات، بحوث ودراسات، معلومات أكاديمية، ترجمة نصوص، مناهج بحث، ندوات ومؤتمرات، دوريات، أخبار. العلوم الاجتماعية",Arabic,Arabic,Paperback,1,255 pages,"

","A Chance Encounter Forever Changed Their Lives--and Destinies. Crafted by two masters of inspirational fiction--Janette Oke and T. Davis Bunn--and combining the engaging historical settings, rich characterization, and heartwarming messages quintessential to both authors, The Meeting Place is another timeless story for you to cherish.Set along the rugged coastline of 18th century Canada in what was then called Acadia (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), The Meeting Place re-creates a world that was home to native Indians, French settlers, and English garrisons. Such diverse populations did not live in accord, however. Instead, they were isolated within their own groups by a brewing political tension under the difficult English rule.Amid such chaotic times two women, both about to become brides and both trying to live lives of quiet peace, meet in a lush field of wildflowers. Louisa, a Frenchwoman, and Catherine, who is English, continue to meet secretly through the seasons, sharing both friendship and growing faith.The outside world does not mirror their own tranquil happiness, and the dreaded crackdown by the English throne threatens far more than their growing bond. In the face of a heart-wrenching dilemma, Louisa and Catherine strive to maintain their faith and cling to their dreams of family and home.

","A sparkling debut and beginning of The Lewis Legacy Series, Awakening has become one of the most popular contemporary Christian romances available today. A God-fearing man. A God-seeking woman. For Sam Lewis and Lexa Clarke, it proves a combustible combination. Lexa Clarke signs up for a TeamWork Missions summer assignment expecting adventure in a far-off, exotic country. Instead, she's sent to sweltering San Antonio to help rebuild homes destroyed by sudden flooding. She survives the four-hour bus trip from Houston, dust in the lungs, a flat tire, a tool-throwing incident and a spitting goat - not to mention an inquisition from a distractingly handsome cowboy - all before reaching the work camp. TeamWork director Sam Lewis isn't sure what to think of his newest volunteer. She's feisty, witty, and incredibly pretty, but looks more prepared to board a cruise ship than build houses. Burned by a past betrayal, he's got a job to do, a reputation to uphold. Sam can't afford to be distracted by a woman who attracts animals, defies his rules, finds trouble at every turn and questions God's purpose. But when she tumbles from the top beam of one of the houses into his arms, Sam suspects his life will never be the same. During their weeks together in the TeamWork camp, Sam and Lexa learn the power of forgiveness and healing. Enduring a chain of incidents which challenge their faith, trust and growing relationship, they look to the Lord for guidance as together they discover a love greater than either could ever imagine. At the end of the eight-week work camp, Sam is committed to a year-long, dangerous overseas mission for TeamWork. Can Lexa trust the Lord enough to let him go? Will Sam safely return and keep his promise to meet her at the Alamo? You'll keep turning the pages of this sweeping romantic adventure. With great characters, plenty of humor, enough emotion to make you shed a tear or two, and an ending that'll have you cheering, Awakening will leave you breathless. Hold on tight. The adventures of Lewis and Clarke have only just begun",English,English,Paperback,,262 pages,"

","Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: cases in which personal contact between an individual or individuals is initiated by the “occupants” of the spacecraft. Such contact may involve the transportation of the individual from his or her terrestrial surroundings into the spacecraft, where the individual is communicated with and/or subjected to an examination before being returned.  One might expect that a “scientific conference” devoted to people who have reported being kidnapped by “little green men” would be dismissed out of hand. But C.D.B. Bryan, the greatly admired journalist and author of Friendly Fire, did not dismiss it: the conference was to be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and would have as its chairmen a Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard psychiatry professor and a professor of physics from M.I.T.             Bryan attended the conference throughout its five days. He approached the subject with no prior stand, no agenda, and an open (if slightly skeptical) mind.             As the conference progressed, he was astonished by the quality of the stories told by the hundreds of men and women who came forward hesitantly and reluctantly with their utterly amazing—and utterly convincing—accounts of having been abducted and then examined aboard extraterrestrial spacecraft by spindly limbed, telepathic gray creatures with outsized foreheads dominated by huge, compelling, tear-shaped black eyes.             What most astonished Bryan were the similarities found again and again in these accounts and the consistency of their details. It is here that the heart of the mystery lies: as the Harvard professor John E. Mack asked at the conference, “If what the abductees are saying isn’t happening to them, then what is?”             This question—and the possible answers—are at the center of this richly explicit, serious, and riveting book.             Bryan recreates the conference. He interviews ufology’s most prominent psychiatrists, psychologists, hypnotherapists, researchers, physicists, physicians, and folklorists. He interweaves throughout the testimony of the abductees themselves, who tell us their stories in chilling detail.             He presents, in depth, the Close Encounter experiences of two women whose stories he tells on the basis of both their spontaneous recollections of the events and their memories that were retrieved through sessions of hypnosis of which Bryan himself was a witness.             Finally, Bryan examines the current theories—psychological, psychiatric, medical, parapsychological—that have been put forward by the unconvinced to explain the abduction phenomenon. Are the abductees suffering from some sort of false memory syndrome? . . . a multiple or dissociative personality disorder? . . . Are they fantasy-prone?             Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind is a detailed, objective exploration—the most concrete to date—of one of the enduring and amazing mysteries of our time. It is a book that will equally fascinate believers and nonbelievers.",0307803163,9780307803160),ebook,,476 pages,"

Everything changes when he meets his wife Rosa thanks to the help of the Happy Heart Marriage Agency. They seem to have an understanding: Jose isn't bothered by Rosa's dishonesty, extra weight, and fantastically promiscuous past; Rosa isn't too put off by Jose's clubbed foot, periodic blackouts, or lack of direction--she just wants a house. Pragmatic, Jose sets out to get the money necessary to make that possible. And in doing so, he manages to become a robber, sniper, and political subversive wanted by the government. Deploying fast-paced, short chapters in a number of styles, Brandao deftly presents an array of engaging characters and conflicts, vividly depicting the absurdity of a repressive political regime with exceptional daring and humor.",1564783316,9781564783318),Paperback,,305 pages,"

Tori Spelling might have grown up with everything a girl could wish for, but these days she's just another suburban working mom...whose toddler regularly recognizes her in the pages of Us Weekly. Welcome to Mommywood, where the stars are two feet tall and your neighbors know who you are before you move in. Like most parents, Tori wants her children to have the one thing she didn't have as a kid -- a normal family. On their hit Oxygen reality show, Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood, the starlet and her husband Dean McDermott regularly wrestle dirty diapers, host the neighborhood block party, and tackle temper tantrums on the red carpet. But when the cameras aren't rolling, Tori's still having awkward run-ins with a former 90210 costar at a laser tag birthday party, scooping rogue poo out of the kiddie pool on a resort vacation, and racing to win back her pre-baby body before the media starts calling her fat. For all her suburban fantasies, Tori Spelling is no June Cleaver. With the same down-to-earth wit that made her entertaining memoir sTORI telling a #1 New York Times bestseller, Tori tells the hilarious and humbling stories of life as a mom in the limelight.

","There are few authors who can weave nail-biting thrills, edge-of-your-seat drama, and romantic suspense as masterfully as Julie Garwood. Now she ratchets up the tension with Murder List, in which evil is on the hunt– and proves to be methodically organized and chillingly successful.When Chicago detective Alec Buchanan is offered a prime position with the FBI, it is the perfect opportunity to leave the Windy City and follow in his brothers’ footsteps to the top echelons of law enforcement. But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo–and the victim is no stranger.Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar.At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little “cleansing” exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist? Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call–and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot.The experience is all but forgotten–until the first person on Regan’s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move–and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.",0345453832,9780345453839),Paperback,,425 pages,"

Bryant is convinced that he saw them as they looked over a century before, but the elderly detective has already lost the funeral urn of an old friend. Could he be losing his mind as well?Then it becomes clear that a number of women have met their ends in London pubs. It seems a silent, secret killer is at work, striking in full view...and yet nobody has a clue how, or why - or where he'll attack next.

","A candid memoir about growing up during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, adapted by the author from his Colors of the Mountain, published by Random House.Da Chen was born in China in 1962. The grandson of a landlord, he and his family were treated as outcasts in Communist China. In school, Da was an excellent student until a teacher told him that, because of his “family’s crimes,” he could never be more than a poor farmer. Feeling his fate was hopeless, Da responded by dropping out and hanging around with a gang. However, after Mao’s death, Da realized that an education and college might be possible, but he had to make up for the time he’d wasted. He began to study–all day and into the night. His entire family rallied to help him succeed, working long hours in the rice fields and going into debt to ensure that Da would have an education. When the final exam results were posted, he had one of the highest scores in the region and had earned a place at the prestigious Beijing University. Now his family’s past would not harm their future.From the Hardcover edition.",044022926X,9780440229261),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","For over fifty years, New York Times bestseller Mastering the Art of French Cooking has been the definitive book on the subject for American readers. Featuring 524 delicious recipes, in its pages home cooks will find something for everyone, from seasoned experts to beginners who love good food and long to reproduce the savory delights of French cuisine, from historic Gallic masterpieces to the seemingly artless perfection of a dish of spring-green peas. Here Julia Child, Simone Beck, and Louisette Bertholle break down the classic foods of France into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of dishes. Throughout, the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations--bound to increase anyone's culinary repertoire. With over 100 instructive illustrations to guide readers every step of the way, Mastering the Art of French Cooking deserves a place of honor in every kitchen in America.",0375413405,9780375413407),Hardcover,,752 pages,"

","Marjorie Holmes, the award-winning author of such classic bestsellers as I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God, was renowned for making the Bible come to life in books that brought hope and inspiration to millions. The first novel in this trilogy-her acclaimed, hugely successful Two from Galilee-told the great love story of Mary and Joseph as never before.  Now, in Three from Galilee, Holmes's fictionalized retelling of the life of Jesus covers a period overlooked by the Gospels-the ""lost years"" between age 12, when Jesus debated the elders in the temple, to the age of 30, when he actually began his ministry. With great reverence, she dares to wonder what Jesus did during those years, if he was like other young men of his time, and whether he experienced God's greatest gift to humanity-love. Using her remarkable talents, Holmes brings Jesus, his parents, brothers, sisters, and friends to life in a story that is dramatic, deeply moving, and unforgettable.",0425205509,9780425205501),Paperback,,304 pages,"

","Dans ce petit opuscule, rédigé en 1952, Claude Lévi-Strauss, qui n'est pas encore un anthropologue renommé, nous livre sa conception du fait culturel. Sans polémiquer, le texte renverse bon nombre d'idées reçues : l'illusion ethnocentrique selon laquelle l'humanité s'arrête aux portes de sa propre culture est partagée par tous les peuples ; l'idée de sociétés primitives suppose la croyance naïve en un progrès général de l'humanité au nom duquel certaines civilisations sont jugées en avance sur d'autres. Quant à la notion de race, contestée par la biologie génétique, elle n'a pas davantage de pertinence pour l'anthropologue qui raisonne sur des cultures qui ne sont jamais homogènes du point de vue ethnique. Ce que l'auteur met finalement en question, à travers ces quelques pages, c'est le discours humaniste de l'essence humaine. Pour l'anthropologue, il n'y a pas une humanité mais des peuples, qui n'existent que par les diversités qui les distinguent. Une belle leçon de relativisme culturel. --Émilio Balturi ",2070324133,9782070324132),Paperback,,127 pages,"

The children's fate is in the hands of the two teens, each recovering from great loss, who now must reestablish trust in a relationship damaged by betrayal.

","When shy Jenny Cooper goes to stay with her cousin Jane Austen, she knows nothing of the world of beautiful dresses, dances, secrets, gossip, and romance that Jane inhabits. At fifteen, Jane is already a sharp observer of the customs of courtship. So when Jenny falls utterly in love with Captain Thomas Williams, who better than Jane to help her win the heart of this dashing man? But is that even possible? After all, Jenny’s been harboring a most desperate secret. Should it become known, it would bring scandal not only to her, but also to the wonderful Austen family. What’s a poor orphan girl to do? In this delicious dance between truth and fiction, Cora Harrison has crafted Jenny’s secret diary by reading everything Jane Austen wrote as a child and an adult, and by researching biographies, critical studies, and family letters. Jenny’s diary makes the past spring vividly to life and provides insight into the entire Austen family—especially the beloved Jane.",English,English,Hardcover,,342 pages,"

","From nearly two hundred centres, and every week added to their number, roared the unquenchable crimson conflagrations of the atomic bombs. The flimsy fabric of the world's credit had vanished, industry was completely disorganised, and every city, every thickly populated area was starving or trembled on the verge of starvation. Most of the capital cities of the world were burning; millions of people had already perished, and over great areas government was at an end.The Last War erupts in Europe, rapidly escalating from bloody trench warfare and vicious aerial duels into a world-consuming, atomic holocaust. Paris is engulfed by an atomic maelstrom, Berlin is an ever-flaming crater, the cold waters of the North Sea roar past Dutch dikes and sweep across the Low Countries. Moscow, Chicago, Tokyo, London, and hundreds of other cities become radioactive wastelands. Governments topple, age-old cultural legacies are destroyed, and the stage is set for a new social and political order.The Last War is H.G. Wells's chilling and prophetic tale of a world gone mad with atomic weapons and of the rebirth of humankind from the rubble. Written long before the atomic age, Wells's novel is a riveting and intelligent history of the future that discusses for the first time the horrors of the atomic bomb, offering a startling vision of humanity purged by catastrophic atomic war.",080329820X,9780803298200),Paperback,,166 pages,"

Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone. Alexander McCall Smith's Precious Ramotswe. Every once in a while, a detective bursts on the scene who captures readers' hearts -- and imaginations -- and doesn't let go. And so it was with Jacqueline Winspear's Maisie Dobbs, who made her debut just two years ago in the eponymously titled first book of the series, and is already on her way to becoming a household name. A deathbed plea from his wife leads Sir Cecil Lawton to seek the aid of Maisie Dobbs, psychologist and investigator. As Maisie soon learns, Agnes Lawton never accepted that her aviator son was killed in the Great War, a torment that led her not only to the edge of madness but to the doors of those who practice the dark arts and commune with the spirit world. In accepting the assignment, Maisie finds her spiritual strength tested, as well as her regard for her mentor, Maurice Blanche. The mission also brings her together once again with her college friend Priscilla Evernden, who served in France and who lost three brothers to the war -- one of whom, it turns out, had an intriguing connection to the missing Ralph Lawton.Following on the heels of the triumphant Birds of a Feather, Pardonable Lies is the most compelling installment yet in the chronicles of Maisie Dobbs, ""a heroine to cherish (Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times Book Review).",0312426216,9780312426217),Paperback,,359 pages,"

","""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."" The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a ""little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves."" He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, ""looking for someone to share in an adventure,"" Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure. The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, The Lord of the Rings, would eventually spring. Though The Hobbit is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. --Alix Wilber",061815082X,9780618150823),Paperback,,330 pages,"

","There is a competitive advantage out there, arguably more powerful than any other. Is it superior strategy? Faster innovation? Smarter employees? No, New York Times best-selling author, Patrick Lencioni, argues that the seminal difference between successful companies and mediocre ones has little to do with what they know and how smart they are and more to do with how healthy they are. In this book, Lencioni brings together his vast experience and many of the themes cultivated in his other best-selling books and delivers a first: a cohesive and comprehensive exploration of the unique advantage organizational health provides. Simply put, an organization is healthy when it is whole, consistent and complete, when its management, operations and culture are unified. Healthy organizations outperform their counterparts, are free of politics and confusion and provide an environment where star performers never want to leave. Lencioni's first non-fiction book provides leaders with a groundbreaking, approachable model for achieving organizational health--complete with stories, tips and anecdotes from his experiences consulting to some of the nation's leading organizations. In this age of informational ubiquity and nano-second change, it is no longer enough to build a competitive advantage based on intelligence alone. The Advantage provides a foundational construct for conducting business in a new way--one that maximizes human potential and aligns the organization around a common set of principles.",0470941529,9780470941522),Hardcover,,216 pages,"

But when her mother dies and her world darkens with sorrow, Isidore finds her belief in the fey folk wavering.  The love of her new step-sister, Blessing, proves an unexpected gift in her time of need. Yet even as their friendship blooms, Isidore begins to see that Blessing is everything she herself has always wanted to be, but is not. Jealousy grips Isidore as she watches this beautiful new sister steal away all she holds dear.  Driven to desperation, Isidore turns to the fey folk once more. She has only one wish to claim from them, one chance to make things right. But she must tread carefully. For wishes, like hearts, are easily broken. And obtaining the one thing she desires could mean destroying the one thing she truly needs. ",English,English,Kindle Edition,,96 pages,"

Housed in the Children's Galleries of the Chicago Art Institute, they are a collection of 68 exquisitely crafted miniature rooms made in the 1930s by Mrs. James Ward Thorne. Each of the 68 rooms is designed in the style of a different historic period, and every detail is perfect, from the knobs on the doors to the candles in the candlesticks. Some might even say, the rooms are magic. Imagine--what if you discovered a key that allowed you to shrink so that you were small enough to sneak inside and explore the rooms' secrets? What if you discovered that others had done so before you? And that someone had left something important behind?Fans of Chasing Vermeer, The Doll People, and From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

","More than just a dimpled smile and chiseled jaw, Theo Amato’s quick-thinking and bold confidence made him successful. Heavy responsibilities left time for close friends and family, but nothing more. It wasn’t until he looked into a pair of big green eyes that his focus changed.  Full lips, a gorgeous face, and an endearing personality had him hooked from the start.  There was nothing Dahlia Kincaid enjoyed more than a good book, a funny movie, and a full night’s sleep. Long workdays meant she rarely had time for any of them, but the sacrifice was worth it to live in the city. It wasn’t until she met a man with model good looks and sexy veined hands that her life changed in ways she'd never even known to dream of.  Wickedly sweet, Theo gently and strategically pulled Dahlia from her rut, handing her the world in the process.  But shadows play tricks on the eyes, and life wasn’t always what it seemed.  With them…  It was better.  Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to adult content, language, and situations.",B01MZ28O3P,B01MZ28O3P,Kindle Edition,,416 pages,"

","'In one moment, every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop... There, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth, stood the figure of a solitary Woman, dressed from head to foot in white'The Woman in White famously opens with Walter Hartright's eerie encounter on a moonlit London road. Engaged as a drawing master to the beautiful Laura Fairlie, Walter becomes embroiled in the sinister intrigues of Sir Percival Glyde and his 'charming' friend Count Fosco, who has a taste for white mice, vanilla bonbons, and poison. Pursuing questions of identity and insanity along the paths and corridors of English country houses and the madhouse, The Woman in White is the first and most influential of the Victorian genre that combined Gothic horror with psychological realism.Matthew Sweet's introduction explores the phenomenon of Victorian 'sensation' fiction, and discusses Wilkie Collins's biographical and societal influences.

","Set in Malaysia, this spellbinding and already internationally acclaimed debut introduces us to the prosperous Rajasekharan family as its closely guarded secrets are slowly peeled away.When Chellam, the family’s rubber-plantation-bred servant girl, is dismissed for unnamed crimes, her banishment is the latest in a series of recent, precipitous losses that have shaken six-year-old Aasha’s life. A few short weeks before, Aasha’s grandmother Paati passed away under mysterious circumstances and her older sister, Uma, departed for Columbia University--leaving Aasha alone to cope with her mostly absent father, her bitter mother, and her imperturbable older brother.Beginning with Aasha’s grandfather’s ascension from Indian coolie to illustrious resident of the Big House on Kingfisher Lane, and going on to tell the story of how Appa, the family’s Oxford-educated patriarch, courted Amma, the humble girl next door, Evening Is the Whole Day moves gracefully backward and forward in time to answer the many questions that haunt the family: What was Chellam’s unforgivable crime? Why was Uma so intent on leaving? How and why did Paati die? What did Aasha see? And, underscoring all of these mysteries: What ultimately became of Appa’s once-grand dreams for his family and his country? Sweeping in scope, sumptuously lyrical, and masterfully constructed, Evening Is the Whole Day offers an unflinching look at relationships between parents and children, brothers and sisters, the wealthy and the poor, a country and its citizens--and the ways in which each sometimes fails the other. Illuminating in heartbreaking detail one Indian immigrant family’s secrets and lies while exposing the complex underbelly of Malaysia itself, Preeta Samarasan’s debut is a mesmerizing and vital achievement sure to earn her a place alongside Arundhati Roy, Kiran Desai, and Zadie Smith.",061887447X,9780618874477),Hardcover,,340 pages,"

","A Kiss Before Dying not only debuted the talent of best-selling novelist Ira Levin to rave reviews, it also set a new standard in the art of mystery and suspense. Now a modern classic, as gripping in its tautly plotted action as it is penetrating in its exploration of a criminal mind, it tells the shocking tale of a young man who will stop at nothing--not even murder--to get where he wants to go. For he has dreams; plans. He also has charm, good looks, sex appeal, intelligence. And he has a problem. Her name is Dorothy; she loves him, and she's pregnant. The solution may demand desperate measures. But, then, he looks like the kind of guy who could get away with murder. Compellingly, step by determined step, the novel follows this young man in his execution of one plan he had neither dreamed nor foreseen. Nor does he foresee how inexorably he will be enmeshed in the consequences of his own extreme deed.",1405076747,9781405076746),Paperback,,103 pages,"

When the wildly beautiful Harper stumbles into his life, though, he realizes that she's the perfect decoy. A fake girlfriend to keep his family off his back until he's out on another mission.  So what if a single bite of her lip sends his mind to wicked places? He can control himself. Can't he?  Harper was on her way to starting a new life... again.

","Дълбоко в горите на Русия се случват необикновени неща. В прегръдките на руската пустош зимата трае цяла вечност, а снежните преспи са по-високи от къщите. Но на Василиса това не ѝ пречи. Тя прекарва вечерите сгушена около топлината на огъня, обградена от обичните си близки, докато слуша приказките на бавачката си. Любимата ѝ приказка е за Мраз – синеокия зимен демон, който се появява в ледените зимни вечери, за да отведе непредпазливите души. Бавачката разказва, че мъдрите хора се боят от него и че почитането на духовете предпазва дома им от зло.След като майката на Василиса умира, баща ѝ отива в Москва и се връща с нова съпруга. Тя ненавижда селските порядки и забранява почитането на духовете. Всички смирено се съгласяват, но Василиса е ужасена, защото усеща, че това ще донесе само нещастия.И се оказва права – реколтите загиват, зли същества от гората започват да се приближават и нещастие се настанява в селото. През това време мащехата на Василиса става все по-сурова с нея.Опасността приближава и Василиса трябва да се противопостави дори на близките си, като призове опасни дарби, които дълго е потискала.

","The first and definitive biography of one of America's bestselling, notorious, and influential writers of the twentieth century: Iceberg Slim, né Robert Beck, author of the multimillion-copy memoir Pimp and such equally popular novels as Trick Baby and Mama Black Widow. From a career as a, yes, ruthless pimp in the '40s and '50s, Iceberg Slim refashioned himself as the first and still the greatest of ""street lit"" masters, whose vivid books have made him an icon to such rappers as Ice-T, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg and a presiding spirit of ""blaxploitation"" culture. You can't understand contemporary black (and even American) culture without reckoning with Iceberg Slim and his many acolytes and imitators. Literature professor Justin Gifford has been researching the life and work of Robert Beck for a decade, culminating in Street Poison, a colorful and compassionate biography of one of the most complicated figures in twentieth-century literature. Drawing on a wealth of archival material—including FBI files, prison records, and interviews with Beck, his wife, and his daughters—Gifford explores the sexual trauma and racial violence Beck endured that led to his reinvention as Iceberg Slim, one of America's most infamous pimps of the 1940s and '50s. From pimping to penning his profoundly influential confessional autobiography, Pimp, to his involvement in radical politics, Gifford's biography illuminates the life and works of one of American literature's most unique renegades.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Hardcover,,265 pages,"

","Maksim Gorky was a Soviet author and founder of the socialist realism literary method. He was also a political activist who spent several lengthy stays in Capri and Italy. Gorky traveled throughout his native land and at one point became friends with Lenin. His travels overwhelmed him with the vastness and beauty of his country and they also made him sharply aware of the ignorance and poverty of its people. This novel tells the story of the common proletariat who protested against the czar and the capitalists which eventually led to the October Revolution. Pelageya is the wife of a factory worker who ignores the political upheaval in her country in favor of caring for her personal life. She represents hundreds of workers who are concerned with living their lives. Her son Pavel takes a different path and joins the revolution inspiring many Russians who were living under a capitalistic society in Russia.

","The guitarist for seminal female punk group The Slits recounts playing with Sid Vicious, touring with the Clash, dating Mick Jones, inspiring “Train in Vain,” and releasing her solo debut in 2012Viv Albertine is one of a handful of original punks who changed music, and the discourse around it, forever. Her memoir tells the story of how, through sheer will, talent, and fearlessness, she forced herself into a male-dominated industry, became part of a movement that changed music, and inspired a generation of female rockers.After forming The Flowers of Romance with Sid Vicious in 1976, Albertine joined The Slits and made musical history in one of the first generations of punk bands. The Slits would go on to serve as an inspiration to future rockers, including Kurt Cobain, Carrie Brownstein, and the Riot Grrrl movement in the 1990s. This is the story of what it was like to be a girl at the height of punk: the sex, the drugs, the guys, the tours, and being part of a brilliant pioneering group of women making musical history. Albertine recounts helping define punk fashion, struggling to find her place among the boys, and her romance with Mick Jones, including her pregnancy and subsequent abortion. She also gives a candid account of what happened post-punk, beyond the break-up of The Slits in 1982, including a career in film, surviving cancer, and making music again, twenty-five years later.A truly remarkable memoir told in Viv’s frank, irreverent, and distinctive voice, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes.

","Mikhail Bulgakov's devastating satire of Soviet life was written during the darkest period of Stalin's regime. Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts—one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow—the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue—including the vodka-drinking black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita—exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grotesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.Though completed in 1940, ""The Master and Margarita"" wasn't published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine ""Moskva."" It was an immediate and enduring success: audiences responded with great enthusiasm to its expression of artistic and spiritual freedom.",1840226579,9781840226577),Paperback,Wordsworth Classics,418 pages,"

","So essential is Crime and Punishment (1866) to global literature and even to our understanding of roiling Russia today that Edward Snowden, while confined to the Moscow airport, was given only three books to help him absorb the culture, one being Fyodor Dostoevsky’s classic in which Raskolnikov, an impoverished student, sees himself as extraordinary and therefore free to commit crimes—even murder—in a work that best embodies the existential dilemmas of man’s instinctual will to power. Yet English translators have long struggled with excessive literalism, and no translation exists that is truly felicitous to the literary nuances of the original prose. Now, acclaimed translator Michael R. Katz addresses these challenges with new insights into the linguistic richness, the subtle tones, and the cunning humor. With its searing and unique portrayal of the labyrinthine universe of nineteenth-century St. Petersburg, this sparkling rendering of Dostoevsky’s masterpiece will be read for decades to come.",English,English,Hardcover,,624 pages,"

","Sir Thomas Browne is one of the supreme stylists of the English language: a coiner of words and spinner of phrases to rival Shakespeare; the wielder of a weird and wonderful erudition; an  inquiring spirit in the mold of Montaigne. Browne was an inspiration to the Romantics as well as to W.G. Sebald, and his work is quirky, sonorous, and enchanting. Here this baroque master’s two most enduring and admired works, Religio Medici and Urne-Buriall, appear in a new edition that has been annotated and introduced by the distinguished scholars Ramie Targoff and Stephen Greenblatt (author of the best-selling Will in the World and the National Book Award–winning The Swerve). In Religio Medici Browne mulls over the relation between his medical profession and his profession of the Christian faith, pondering the respective claims of science and religion, questions that are still very much alive today. The discovery of an ancient burial site in an English field prompted Browne to write Urne-Buriall, which is both an early  anthropological examination of different practices of interment and a profound meditation on mortality. Its grave and exquisite music has resounded for generations.",1590174887,9781590174883),Paperback,,224 pages,"

","""It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.""So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power.Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas---this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate lovefor India at its heart. Based on the life of the author, it is by any measure the debut of an extraordinary voice in literature.",0349117543,9780349117546),Paperback,New Edition,933 pages,"

","A wealthy and notorious clan, the Bellefleurs live in a region not unlike the Adirondacks, in an enormous mansion on the shores of mythic Lake Noir. They own vast lands and profitable businesses, they employ their neighbors, and they influence the government. A prolific and eccentric group, they include several millionaires, a mass murderer, a spiritual seeker who climbs into the mountains looking for God, a wealthy noctambulist who dies of a chicken scratch.Bellefleur traces the lives of several generations of this unusual family. At its center is Gideon Bellefleur and his imperious, somewhat psychic, very beautiful wife, Leah, their three children (one with frightening psychic abilities), and the servants and relatives, living and dead, who inhabit the mansion and its environs. Their story offers a profound look at the world's changeableness, time and eternity, space and soul, pride and physicality versus love. Bellefleur is an allegory of caritas versus cupiditas, love and selflessness versus pride and selfishness. It is a novel of change, baffling complexity, mystery.Written with a voluptuousness and startling immediacy that transcends Joyce Carol Oates's early works, Bellefleur is widely regarded as a masterwork—a feat of literary genius that forces us ""to ask again how anyone can possibly write such books, such absolutely convincing scenes, rousing in us, again and again, the familiar Oates effect, the point of all her art: joyful terror gradually ebbing toward wonder"" (John Gardner).",006226916X,9780062269164),Paperback,,752 pages,"

","""Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red."" For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the Books of Blood is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:  I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.  These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: ""The Midnight Meat Train,"" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; ""The Yattering and Jack,"" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; ""In the Hills, the Cities,"" an unusual example of an original horror premise; ""Dread,"" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; ""Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,"" about a woman who kills men with her mind.

","Le llaman Noah Thöryn. Es el ojo derecho de As Landin, el mejor amigo del noaiti, y un hombre muy importante en el clan berserker de Wolverhampton. Le dijeron que era hijo de una pareja de guerreros, y que recién nacido fue a parar a manos de As. Ahora ha descubierto que todo es mentira,y que lo único auténtico y real en su vida es la pasión demoledora que siente hacia Nanna, la valkyria intocable de Freyja. Sin embargo aquello que más desea le es negado por normas divinas, y Noah se esta volviendo loco por la desesperación. Si a eso se le añade las extrañas pesadillas que tiene desde que fue herido por el puñal Guddine, su vida es de todo menos apacible. No obstante, las runas hablan con objetividad, y les da igual si ellos son o no son compatibles. Después de sobrevivir milagrosamente en la batalla de Machre Moor, Noah deberá realizar un viaje para descubrir quién es y qué ha venido hacer en el Mirdgard, y es una cuestión innegociable que su pareja en su aventura, sea Nanna. ¿Cómo podrá soportar estar cerca de ella y no tocarla?Nanna siempre fue la niña de los ojos de Freyja. Era la elegida por los dioses para recoger a los muertos en batalla en el Midgard y tiene una gran peculiaridad: ningún hombre vivo la puede tocar. No obstante, el berserker de ojos amarillos ha roto su palabra y ha violado su norma, provocando que la ira de Freyja cayera sobre ella. Nanna no quiere saber nada de él, pero la Diosa Vanir tiene otros planes para ella, que deberá obedecer si quiere que la perdone de nuevo. Empezará un viaje único y revelador, lleno de aventuras, guerra y magia, al lado del único hombre que ha deseado en su vida, del que dicen que es importante para el destino del Ragnarök. Y Nanna no tiene ni idea de cómo sobrellevar la atracción que siente hacia él, sobre todo, cuando viene acompañada de la decepción que supuso que él la traicionara.El Ragnarök ha empezado.Los clanes se reagrupan para luchar juntos.Y en medio de la inminente batalla, un berserker y una valkyria deberán de viajar juntos para descubrir los secretos que los nomas y los dioses han reservado para ellos, sin saber, que el mejor y más importante de todos, será descubrirse el uno al otro en la guerra y en la seducción.Cuando el amor y la valentía brillan tanto como el sol, no se pueden tapar con un solo dedo.",Spanish,Spanish,Mass Market Paperback,,466 pages,"

But because I am an older and wiser cat, she looks to me for counsel, and so I have allowed Grace to prevail upon me to set down the story of my life as a housecat in the human world. . . .As the irrepressible Foudini M. Cat regales us with his adventures, an exciting story unfolds. After his valiant but frail mother leaves him in search for food and never returns, the starving kitten is taken, hissing and spitting, to a frightening room with cages and men in white coats. Facing the specter of eternal sleep, the homeless cat is adopted by a woman he later calls ""Warm."" (""All cats like to make up strange names for things."")From here Foudini enchants us with splendid tales of his unlikely but ultimately poignant friendship with Sam the Dog; their trips between Cold House in the city and Mouse House in the country; his mystical experiences with famous felines of the past; his near-death in a raging river that leads to a profound act of sacrifice; and his introduction to a silly young thing named Grace, which evolves into something completely unexpected.",0449911454,9780449911457),Paperback,,176 pages,"

Many people were amazed to find that women still did the majority of childcare and housework even though they also worked outside the home.

","The delightfully eccentric Doctor Dolittle, rendered immortal on screen by the gifted Rex Harrison, has remained a firm favorite with generations of children ever since he made his debut in an earlier novel, The Story of Doctor Dolittle.In his second outing titledThe Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, the maverick physician takes on a new assistant, Tommy Stubbins. The story is structured as a first person account given by Tommy, who is now a very old man. The boy who was the son of the village cobbler first meets Doctor Dolittle when he takes a hurt squirrel to the doctor for treatment. Tommy and the doctor quickly become friends, and the boy soon learns how to communicate with animals in their own languages. The remarkable talking parrot, Polynesia and other amazing creatures from the previous book also appear in this sequel. The mysterious disappearance of a friend of the doctor's called Luke the Hermit sets off a train of strange events. And Tommy finds himself accompanying the good doctor on an exciting, hazardous voyage to find Long Arrow, a native American and the son of Golden Arrow, who is reputed to be the greatest living naturalist in the world.The kind hearted, quirky, animal rights activist Doctor Dolittle dominates the plot. His enduring humanitarian approach to the world around him, his desire for peaceful coexistence among all and his concern for the environment make him a memorable and endearing character. This as much an adventure story as a strong appeal for compassion towards the innumerable species that share our planet with us. There are shipwrecks, South American and Mediterranean locations, underwater explorations where they discover a giant sea snail and wonderful descriptions of land and sea.Critics of Hugo Lofting's work point out that there are several passages which are now politically incorrect. However, readers would do well to remember that these books were written more than a hundred years ago, when attitudes to colonization and race were quite different.In the dozen or so books featuring Doctor Dolittle, the author Hugo Lofting ensures that a wide variety of themes, locations and ideas are explored. The books were originally illustrated by the author himself, as he was a talented artist and naturalist himself. ",0060776005,9780060776008),Paperback,,400 pages,"

","From Publishers WeeklyThe story of Ronald Gene Simmons and his psychotic rampage, which in 1987 left 14 family members in a mass grave behind their trailer home, is presented here in detail. When his military days were over, Simmons, a former Air Force sergeant, began a torturous series of acts of violence and humiliation against his family. While a fierce presence to his wife, Becky, and six of their seven children, he became exceptionally tender with his favorite daughter, Sheila, and forced her into an incestuous relationship that culminated in the birth of a child. Simmons went through a series of menial jobs and, after several moves, finally settled his family in the foothills of the Ozarks. But faced with growing frustration of his need for control, along with his daughter's rejection of him and marriage to another man, which he claimed had ruined his plans to have a happy life alone with her, he prepared the ritual killing of all those who had made his dream unworkable. While for the most part, Williams ( Tankwar ) and Marshall, a journalist, tell the story convincingly, they fail when they attempt to re-create and explain Simmons's thought processes.Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Library Journal",0671685112,9780671685119),Hardcover,,302 pages,"

","When John Singer Sargent unveiled Madame X -- his famous portrait of American beauty Virginie Gautreau -- at the 1884 Paris Salon, its subject's bold pose and provocative dress shocked the public and the critics, smashing Sargent's dreams of a Paris career. In this remarkable novel, Gioia Diliberto tells Virginie's story, drawing on the sketchy historical facts to re-create Virginie's tempestuous personality and the captivating milieu of nineteenth-century Paris. Born in New Orleans and raised on a lush plantation, Virginie fled to France during the Civil War, where she was absorbed into the fascinating and wealthy world of grand ballrooms, dressmakers' salons, and artists' ateliers. Even before Sargent painted her portrait, Virginie's reputation for promiscuity and showy self-display made her the subject of vicious Paris gossip.  Immersing the reader in Belle Epoque Paris, I Am Madame X is a compulsively readable and richly imagined novel illuminating the struggle between Virginie and Sargent over the outcome of a painting that changed their lives and affected the course of art history.",0743456807,9780743456807),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","The award-winning oral history of Elvia Alvarado, a courageous campesina (peasant) activist in Honduras, the poorest country in Central America. Trained by the Catholic Church to organize women's groups to combat malnutrition, Alvarado began to question why campesinos were malnourished to begin with. Her growing political awareness, her travels by foot over the back roads of Honduras, and her conversations with people frm all over the country have given her insights into the internal workings of her society that far surpass those of the majority of campesinos who have never ventured outside their villages. Working as a campesino organizer, Alvarado has led dangerous land recovery actions in an effort to enforce the national land reform laws. As a result of these activities, she has been harassed, jailed, and tortured at the hands of the Honduran military.Skillfully translated and edited by Medea Benjamin, an expert on Central America, this book takes us into the heart of campesino struggle and political conflict in Honduras today.""Elvia Alvarado tells the story of her life and the life of the people of Honduras.

","James Rollins, the ""New York Times"" bestselling master of nail-biting suspense and historical mystery, combines cutting-edge biotechnology with a centuries-old secret in an apocalyptic story that reveals where humankind is truly headed""The Doomsday Key""At Princeton University, a famed geneticist dies inside a biohazard lab. In Rome, a Vatican archaeologist is found dead in St. Peter's Basilica. In Africa, a U.S. senator's son is slain outside a Red Cross camp. The three murders on three continents bear a horrifying connection: all the victims are marked by a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh.The bizarre murders thrust Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force into a race against time to solve a riddle going back centuries, to a ghastly crime against humanity hidden within a cryptic medieval codex. The first clue is discovered inside a mummified corpse buried in an English peat bog -- a gruesome secret that threatens America and the world.Aided by two women from his past -- one his exlover, the other his new partner -- Gray must piece together the horrifying truth. But the revelations come at a high cost, and to save the future, Gray will have to sacrifice one of the women at his side. That alone might not be enough, as the true path to salvation is revealed in a dark prophecy of doom.Sigma Force confronts humankind's greatest threat in an adventure that races from the Roman Coliseum to the icy peaks of Norway, from the ruins of medieval abbeys to the lost tombs of Celtic kings. The ultimate nightmare is locked within a talisman buried by a dead saint -- an ancient artifact known as the Doomsday Key.",0061231401,9780061231407),Hardcover,,448 pages,"

","When Elizabeth Bennet first met Mr. Darcy, she found him proud, distant, and rude—despite the other ladies' admiration of his estate in Derbyshire and ten thousand pounds a year. But what was Mr. Darcy thinking?Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice has long stood among the most beloved novels of all time. The story of Elizabeth Bennet's blossoming romance with ""haughty, reserved, and fastidious"" Fitzwilliam Darcy has enchanted readers for nearly two centuries. Yet, Mr. Darcy has always remained an intriguing enigma—his thoughts, feelings, and motivations hidden behind a cold, impenetrable exterior . . . until now.With the utmost respect for Austen's original masterwork, author Janet Aylmer loving retells Pride and Prejudice from a bold new perspective: seeing events as they transpire through the eyes of Darcy himself. One of world's great love stories takes on breathtaking new life, and one of fiction's greatest romantic heroes becomes even more sympathetic, compelling, attractive, and accessible, all through the imagination and artistry of a truly gifted storyteller.",English,English,Paperback,,277 pages,"

","Mags had been working at the Pieters’s mine, slaving in the dark, cold seams, looking for sparklies, for as long as he could remember. The children who worked the mine were orphans, kids who had been abandoned, who had lost their parents, or were generally unwanted. But Mags was different.Mags was “Bad Blood,” because his parents were bandits who had been killed in a raid by the Royal Guard. “Bad Blood” because he’d been found in a cradle in the bandits’s camp. Blood so bad that no one had wanted to take him in except Cole Pieters. When he was big enough to see over the sides of the sluices he had gone to work at the mine. Mags knew nothing of the world beyond the mine, and was unaware of how unusual his paltry existence was. Then some strangers on huge white horses forced their way past the Pieters family and carried him away to Haven to become a Herald Trainee.Suddenly the whole world opened up for him. He was warm and well fed for the first time in his life, and he had Dallen, his Companion, who seemed more miraculous than an angel. But the world of the Collegium was not all heavenly. There was political upheaval in Valdemar’s capital, for the court had been infiltrated by foreign “diplomats,” who seemed to be more interested in seeding discontent than in actual diplomacy…and Mags seemed to be the only one who’d noticed.…",1423307941,9781423307945),Audio CD,,340 pages,"

They told him he was of their people, although he was so different. He was ugly in their eyes, strange, sleek-skinned instead of furred, clawless, different. Yet he was of their power class: judge-warriors, the elite, the fighters, the defenders.Thorn knew that his difference was somehow very important -- but not important enough to prevent murderous conspiracies against him, against his protector, against his caste, and perhaps against the peace of the world. But when the crunch came, when Thorn finally learned what his true role in life was to be, that on him might hang the future of two worlds, then he had to stand alone to justify his very existence.Serpent's ReachWithin the Constellation of the Serpent, out of bounds to all spacefarers, humans live among the insect-like aliens--and one of them, a woman named Raen, is bent on a revenge that will tear apart the truce between human and alien.

","Book 7 of the bestselling Love Comes Softly series. Belinda Davis had trained as a nurse to assist her older brother, Doctor Luke. But as time goes by and she sees those she's grown up with getting married and settling into their own lives, Belinda becomes restless. What had seemed exciting and fresh becomes dull and routine. When she meets an elderly woman who needs nursing care, Belinda jumps at the invitation to go to Boston--a large, ""civilized"" city with cultural opportunities she's never even dreamed of in her little prairie town. But in spite of financial security and countless new experiences, Belinda finds herself restless, lonely, and empty inside.",0764228544,9780764228544),Paperback,Revised Edition,240 pages,"

","The story of the American West is the story of a relentless quest for a precious resource: water. It is a tale of rivers diverted and dammed, of political corruption and intrigue, of billion-dollar battles over water rights, of ecologic and economic disaster. In Cadillac Desert Marc Reisner writes of the earliest settlers, lured by the promise of paradise, and of the ruthless tactics employed by Los Angeles politicians and business interests to ensure the city's growth. He documents the bitter rivalry between two government giants, the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in the competition to transform the West.Based on more than a decade of research, Cadillac Desert is a stunning expose and a dramatic, intriguing history of the creation of an Eden—an Eden that may be only a mirage.",0140178244,9780140178241),Paperback,Revised Edition,582 pages,"

","In the city of Coconut Grove, Florida, these things happen: A struggling adman named Eliot Arnold drives home from a meeting with the Client From Hell. His teenage son, Matt, fills a Squirtmaster 9000 for his turn at a high school game called Killer. Matt's intended victim, Jenny Herk, sits down in front of the TV with her mom for what she hopes will be a peaceful evening for once. Jenny's alcoholic and secretly embezzling stepfather, Arthur, emerges from the maid's room, angry at being rebuffed. Henry and Leonard, two hit men from New Jersey, pull up to the Herks' house for a real game of Killer, Arthur's embezzlement apparently not having been quite so secret to his employers after all. And a homeless man named Puggy settles down for the night in a treehouse just inside the Herks' yard.In a few minutes, a chain of events that will change the lives of each and every one of them will begin, and will leave some of them wiser, some of them deader, and some of them definitely looking for a new line of work. With a wicked wit, razor-sharp observations, rich characters, and a plot with more twists than the Inland Waterway, Dave Barry makes his debut a complete and utter triumph.",0425178102,9780425178102),Mass Market Paperback,,317 pages,"

","Frank Herbert's Dune series is one of the great creations of imaginative literature, science fiction's answer to The Lord of the Rings.Decades after Herbert's original novels, the Dune saga was continued by Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with Kevin J. Anderson. Working from Frank Herbert's own notes, the acclaimed authors reveal the chapter of the Dune saga most eagerly anticipated by readers: the Butlerian Jihad.Throughout the Dune novels, Frank Herbert frequently referred to the war in which humans wrested their freedom from ""thinking machines."" In Dune: The Butlerian Jihad, Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson bring to life the story of that war, a tale previously seen only in tantalizing hints and clues. Finally, we see how Serena Butler's passionate grief ignites the struggle that will liberate humans from their machine masters; here is the amazing tale of the Zensunni Wanderers, who escape bondage to flee to the desert world where they will declare themselves the Free Men of Dune. And here is the backward, nearly forgotten planet of Arrakis, where traders have discovered the remarkable properties of the spice melange....",0765340771,9780765340771),Paperback,,684 pages,"

","Born in 1937 in a port city a thousand miles north of Shanghai, Adeline Yen Mah was the youngest child of an affluent Chinese family who enjoyed rare privileges during a time of political and cultural upheaval. But wealth and position could not shield Adeline from a childhood of appalling emotional abuse at the hands of a cruel and manipulative Eurasian stepmother. Determined to survive through her enduring faith in family unity, Adeline struggled for independence as she moved from Hong Kong to England and eventually to the United States to become a physician and writer.A compelling, painful, and ultimately triumphant story of a girl's journey into adulthood, Adeline's story is a testament to the most basic of human needs: acceptance, love, and understanding. With a powerful voice that speaks of the harsh realities of growing up female in a family and society that kept girls in emotional chains, Falling Leaves is a work of heartfelt intimacy and a rare authentic portrait of twentieth-century China.",0767903579,9780767903578),Paperback,,278 pages,"

","Death in the City of Light is the gripping, true story of a brutal serial killer who unleashed his own reign of terror in Nazi-Occupied Paris. As decapitated heads and dismembered body parts surfaced in the Seine, Commissaire Georges-Victor Massu, head of the Brigade Criminelle, was tasked with tracking down the elusive murderer in a twilight world of Gestapo, gangsters, resistance fighters, pimps, prostitutes, spies, and other shadowy figures of the Parisian underworld.The main suspect was Dr. Marcel Petiot, a handsome, charming physician with remarkable charisma. He was the “People’s Doctor,” known for his many acts of kindness and generosity, not least in providing free medical care for the poor. Petiot, however, would soon be charged with twenty-seven murders, though authorities suspected the total was considerably higher, perhaps even as many as 150.Who was being slaughtered, and why? Was Petiot a sexual sadist, as the press suggested, killing for thrills? Was he allied with the Gestapo, or, on the contrary, the French Resistance? Or did he work for no one other than himself? Trying to solve the many mysteries of the case, Massu would unravel a plot of unspeakable deviousness. When Petiot was finally arrested, the French police hoped for answers. But the trial soon became a circus. Attempting to try all twenty-seven cases at once, the prosecution stumbled in its marathon cross-examinations, and Petiot, enjoying the spotlight, responded with astonishing ease. His attorney, René Floriot, a rising star in the world of criminal defense, also effectively, if aggressively, countered the charges.  Soon, despite a team of prosecuting attorneys, dozens of witnesses, and over one ton of evidence, Petiot’s brilliance and wit threatened to win the day.Drawing extensively on many new sources, including the massive, classified French police file on Dr. Petiot, Death in the City of Light is a brilliant evocation of Nazi-Occupied Paris and a harrowing exploration of murder, betrayal, and evil of staggering proportions.",0307452891,9780307452894),Hardcover,,416 pages,"

","The Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has always been an original reader of texts, understanding their many rich historical, aesthetic, and political meanings and effects. In Profanations, Agamben has assembled for the first time some of his most pivotal essays on photography, the novel, and film. A meditation on memory and oblivion, on what is lost and what remains, Profanations proves yet again that Agamben is one of the most provocative writers of our time. In ten essays, Agamben ponders a series of literary and philosophical problems: the relation among genius, ego, and theories of subjectivity; the problem of messianic time as explicated in both images and lived experience; parody as a literary paradigm; and the potential of magic to provide an ethical canon.The range of topics and themes addressed here attest to the creativity of Agamben's singular mode of thought and his persistent concern with the act of witnessing, sometimes futile, sometimes earth-shattering. -In Praise of Profanity, - the central essay of this short but dense book, confronts the question of profanity as the crucial political task of the moment. An act of resistance to every form of separation, the concept of profanation reorients perceptions of how power, consumption, and use interweave to produce an urgent political modality and desire: to profane the unprofanable. Agamben not only provides a new and potent theoretical model but describes it with a writerly style that itself forges inescapable links among literature, politics, and philosophy.",189095182X,9781890951825),Hardcover,,99 pages,"

","Tahir Shah's The Caliph's House, describing his first year in Casablanca, was hailed by critics and compared to such travel classics as A Year in Provence and Under the Tuscan Sun, Now Shah takes us deeper into the heart of this exotic and magical land to uncover mysteries that have been hidden from Western eyes for centuries.... In this entertaining and penetrating book, Tahir sets out on a bold new journey across Morocco that becomes an adventure worthy of the mythical Arabian Nights. As he wends his way through the labyrinthine medinas of Fez and Marrakesh, traverses the Sahara sands, and tastes the hospitality of ordinary Moroccans, Tahir collects a dazzling treasury of traditional stories, gleaned from the heritage of A Thousand and One Nights, The tales, recounted by a vivid cast of characters, reveal fragments of wisdom and an oriental way of thinking that is both enthralling and fresh. A link in the chain of scholars and teachers who have passed these stories down for centuries like a baton in a relay race, Shah reaches layers of culture that most visitors hardly realize exist, and eventually discovers the story living in his own heart. Along the way he describes the colors, characters, and the passion of Morocco, and comes to understand why it is such an enchanting land. From master masons who labor only at night to Sufi wise men who write for soap operas, and Tuareg guides afflicted by reality TV, In Arabian Nights takes us on an unforgettable journey, shining a light on facets of a society that are normally left in darkness.",0553805231,9780553805239),Hardcover,,388 pages,"

","In 2010, when the recession took root in Ireland, the young people looked at the ground they were standing on and realised it was rotten. Rotten in so many ways, but especially in the ways made by man. So most decided it was time to do what their forefathers had done during times of famine, when the ground was rotten too, and leave. For America. And Newfoundland. And Australia. And Canada. But in the winter of 2010, a group of college students had a different idea. They weren’t going to leave. They would simply find a patch of land that hadn’t been contaminated and live off it. Just like their forefathers had always done before the land became rotten and the country corrupted by greed. This is their story.",English,English,Hardcover,,301 pages,"

","An innovative thinker tackles the controversial question of why we believe in God and how religion shapes our lives and our future.For a growing number of people, there is nothing more important than religion. It is an integral part of their marriage, child rearing, and community. In this daring new book, distinguished philosopher Daniel C. Dennett takes a hard look at this phenomenon and asks why. Where does our devotion to God come from and what purpose does it serve? Is religion a blind evolutionary compulsion or a rational choice? In ""Breaking the Spell,"" Dennett argues that the time has come to shed the light of science on the fundamental questions of faith. In a spirited narrative that ranges widely through history, philosophy, and psychology, Dennett explores how organized religion evolved from folk beliefs and why it is such a potent force today. Deftly and lucidly, he contends that the ""belief in belief"" has fogged any attempt to rationally consider the existence of God and the relationship between divinity and human need.""Breaking the Spell"" is not an antireligious screed but rather an eyeopening exploration of the role that belief plays in our lives, our interactions, and our country. With the gulf between rationalists and adherents of ""intelligent design"" widening daily, Dennett has written a timely and provocative book that will be read and passionately debated by believers and nonbelievers alike.",067003472X,9780670034727),Hardcover,,448 pages,"

From the author of the beloved classic, The Christmas Box, comes another inspiring story of the power of love and the wonder of Christmas.

""There are stories, Christmas stories that are stored away like boxes of garlands and frosted glass ornaments, to be brought out and cherished each year. I've come to believe that my story is a Christmas story. For it has forever changed the way I see Christmas.""
The Christmas season is supposed to be full of joy, but not for Mark Smart. Life had dealt him one blow after another until one snowy November night, when he finds a beautiful young woman who will change his life forever. Macy Wood has little memory of her birth parents, and memories she'd rather forget of her adopted home. A Christmas ornament inscribed with the word ""Noel"" is the only clue to the little sister she only vaguely remembers, a clue that will send her and Mark on a journey to reclaim her past, and her family.",0743287037,9780743287036),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

Might you and your baby both sleep better if you shared a bed? How old is too old for breastfeeding? What is a father's role in nurturing a newborn? How does early attachment foster a child's eventual independence? Dr. Bill and Martha Sears -- the doctor-and-nurse, husband-and-wife team who coined the term ""attachment parenting"" -- answer these and many more questions in this practical, inspiring guide. Attachment parenting is a style of parenting that encourages a strong early attachment, and advocates parental responsiveness to babies' dependency needs.

","The Last Train is the harrowing true story about young brothers Paul and Oscar Arato and their mother, Lenke, surviving the Nazi occupation during the final years of World War II.Living in the town of Karcag, Hungary, the Aratos feel insulated from the war — even as it rages all around them. Hungary is allied with Germany to protect its citizens from invasion, but in 1944 Hitler breaks his promise to keep the Nazis out of Hungary.The Nazi occupation forces the family into situations of growing panic and fear: first into a ghetto in their hometown; then a labor camp in Austria; and, finally, to the deadly Bergen Belsen camp deep in the heart of Germany. Separated from their father, 6-year-old Paul and 11-year-old Oscar must care for their increasingly sick mother, all while trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy amid the horrors of the camp.In the spring of 1945, the boys see British planes flying over the camp, and a spark of hope that the war will soon end ignites. And then, they are forced onto a dark, stinking boxcar by the Nazi guards. After four days on the train, the boys are convinced they will be killed, but through a twist of fate, the train is discovered and liberated by a battalion of American soldiers marching through Germany.The book concludes when Paul, now a grown man living in Canada, stumbles upon photographs on the internet of his train being liberated. After writing to the man who posted the pictures, Paul is presented with an opportunity to meet his rescuers at a reunion in New York — but first he must decide if he is prepared to reopen the wounds of his past.",1926973623,9781926973623),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

","In this combative, controversial book, Terry Eagleton takes issue with the prejudice that Marxism is dead and done with. Taking ten of the most common objections to Marxism—that it leads to political tyranny, that it reduces everything to the economic, that it is a form of historical determinism, and so on—he demonstrates in each case what a woeful travesty of Marx's own thought these assumptions are. In a world in which capitalism has been shaken to its roots by some major crises, Why Marx Was Right is as urgent and timely as it is brave and candid. Written with Eagleton's familiar wit, humor, and clarity, it will attract an audience far beyond the confines of academia.",English,English,Hardcover,,258 pages,"

","In this illuminating book, the renowned theoretical physicist Lee Smolin argues that fundamental physics -- the search for the laws of nature -- losing its way. Ambitious ideas about extra dimensions, exotic particles, multiple universes, and strings have captured the public’s imagination -- and the imagination of experts. But these ideas have not been tested experimentally, and some, like string theory, seem to offer no possibility of being tested. Yet these speculations dominate the field, attracting the best talent and much of the funding and creating a climate in which emerging physicists are often penalized for pursuing other avenues. As Smolin points out, the situation threatens to impede the very progress of science. With clarity, passion, and authority, Smolin offers an unblinking assessment of the troubles that face modern physics -- and an encouraging view of where the search for the next big idea may lead.",061891868X,9780618918683),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","This stirring novel is set in the climactic months before the opening of the Third Crusade, called the Kings' Crusade. The Brethren is a classic tale of love and chivalry, unfolding amidst the touching story of two English knights who are in love with the same maiden. The devotion of these men is tested when their beloved is carried away against her will to Palestine and eventually to the court of the famous Muslim leader, Saladin.Excerpt:From the sea-wall on the coast of Essex, Rosamund looked out across the ocean eastwards. To right and left, but a little behind her, like guards attending the person of their sovereign, stood her cousins, the twin brethren, Godwin and Wulf, tall and shapely men. Godwin was still as a statue, his hands folded over the hilt of the long, scabbarded sword, of which the point was set on the ground before him, but Wulf, his brother, moved restlessly, and at length yawned aloud. They were beautiful to look at, all three of them, as they appeared in the splendour of their youth and health. The imperial Rosamund, dark-haired and eyed, ivory skinned and slender-waisted, a posy of marsh flowers in her hand; the pale, stately Godwin, with his dreaming face; and the bold-fronted, blue-eyed warrior, Wulf, Saxon to his finger-tips, notwithstanding his father's Norman blood. At the sound of that unstifled yawn, Rosamund turned her head with the slow grace which marked her every movement. ""Would you sleep already, Wulf, and the sun not yet down?"" she asked in her rich, low voice, which, perhaps because of its foreign accent, seemed quite different to that of any other woman.",English,English,Paperback,,424 pages,"

","It is the glorious second day of May, 1942. The sun is drawing the damp from earth still heavy with the end of a long Quebec winter, the budding branches of the trees along rue Fabre and in Parc Lafontaine of the Plateau Mont Royal ache to release their leaves into the warm, clear air heralding the approach of summer.Seven women in this raucous Francophone working-class Montreal neighbourhood are pregnant—only one of them, “the fat woman,” is bearing a child of true love and affection. Next door to the home that is by times refuge, asylum, circus-arena, confessional and battleground to her extended family, with ancient roots in both rural Quebec and the primordial land of the Saskatchewan Cree, stands an immaculately kept but seemingly empty house where the fates, Rose, Mauve, Violet and their mother Florence, only ever fleetingly and uncertainly glimpsed by those in a state of emotional extremis, are knitting the booties of what will become the children of a whole new nation.In this first of six novels that became his Chronicles of the Plateau Mont Royal, Tremblay allows his imagination free reign, fictionalizing the lives of his beloved characters, dramatized so brilliantly in his plays and remembered so poignantly in his memoirs.“The fat woman” both is and is not Michel Tremblay’s mother—her extended family and neighbours more than a symbol of a colonized people: abandoned and mocked by France; conquered and exploited by England; abused and terrorized by the Church; and forced into a war by Canada supporting the very powers that have crushed their spirit and twisted their souls since time immemorial. This is a “divine comedy” of the extraordinary triumphs and tragedies of ordinary people caught up by circumstances that span the range of the ridiculous to the sublime.",0889221901,9780889221901),Paperback,,252 pages,"

He possesses an extraordinary gift which allows him to leave his body during the night and go anywhere, see anything—unseen, undetected. Unbeknownst to Paul, he is not alone in his ability--there are others who can do what he can, and they belong to Astralis, a government agency funded by the United Nations who train people like Paul to become spies. When one of their scouts recognizes Paul for what he is, he is offered a place in the agency. Paul makes a new life at Astralis, forging new friendships and inadvertently creating new enemies. Through the mentoring of the agency's director, Dr. Abrams, Paul finds a place where he finally feels he belongs. Unfortunately, Astralis is an organization under siege from within. Not everyone feels Dr. Abrams is a fit director, and some are willing to do anything to make a change of leadership--even murder.",English,English,ebook,Smashwords,322 pages,"

","Breaking nearly eight decades of silence, Essie Mae Washington–Williams comes forward with a story of unique historical magnitude and incredible human drama. Her father, the late Strom Thurmond, was once the nation's leading voice for racial segregation (one of his signature political achievements was his 24–hour filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1957, done in the name of saving the South from ""mongrelization""). Her mother, however, was a black teenager named Carrie Butler who worked as a maid on the Thurmond family's South Carolina plantation.Set against the explosively changing times of the civil rights movement, this poignant memoir recalls how she struggled with the discrepancy between the father she knew–one who was financially generous, supportive of her education, even affectionate–and the Old Southern politician, railing against greater racial equality, who refused to acknowledge her publicly. From her richly told narrative, as well as the letters she and Thurmond wrote to each other over the years, emerges a nuanced, fascinating portrait of a father who counseled his daughter about her dreams and goals, and supported her in reaching them–but who was unwilling to break with the values of his Dixiecrat constituents.With elegance, dignity, and candor, Washington–Williams gives us a chapter of American history as it has never been written before–told in a voice that will be heard and cherished by future generations.",0060761423,9780060761424),Paperback,,240 pages,"

","She had no choice in the matter-none of the girls did. Her mission was to give birth to and raise many children in devoted service to a shared husband. Susan was fifteen years old when she became the sixth wife of Verlan LeBaron- one of the leaders of a rogue Mormon cult engaged in a blood feud with his brother that, from 1972 to 1988, claimed up to two dozen lives and led one prosecutor to call their descendants a Lord of the Flies generation. In this gripping and eloquent book, Susan Ray Schmidt tells the story of growing up on the inside and of her ultimate escape. Delving more deeply into this mysterious underworld than any previous work, Favorite Wife is a powerful account of the affairs of the heart, coming of age under exceptional circumstances, and the tough choices that are sometimes painfully necessary to preserve human dignity.",1599214946,9781599214948),Paperback,,416 pages,"

Troubled by his wife’s disturbing mental state and concerned about a mysterious plague sweeping through his slave population, Master Satterfield purchases Polly Shine, a slave reputed to be a healer. But Polly’s sharp tongue and troubling predictions cause unrest across the plantation. Complicating matters further, Polly recognizes “the gift” in Granada, the mistress’s pet, and a domestic battle of wills ensues.   Seventy-five years later, Granada, now known as Gran Gran, is still living on the plantation and must revive the buried memories of her past in order to heal a young girl abandoned to her care. Together they learn the power of story to heal the body, the spirit and the soul.  Rich in mood and atmosphere, The Healing is the kind of novel readers can’t put down—and can’t wait to recommend once they’ve finished.This download includes a 30-minute bonus feature.",0385534671,9780385534673),Hardcover,,352 pages,"

","""No man ever did more to alter and correct the map of the Earth,"" writes Percy Adams in his new Introduction, than James Cook, the Scotland-born British naval commander who rose from humble beginnings to pilot three great eighteenth-century voyages of discovery in the then practically uncharted Pacific. His explorations of the eastern coastline of Australia, leading to its eventual British colonization; his thorough charting of New Zealand, discovery of the Hawaiian Island, and his investigation of both the mythical 'Terra Incognita' in the southern ocean and the equally mythical Northwest Passage, as well as his contributions to cartography and to the cure and prevention of sea disease were all of immense scientific and political significance. Though lacking in formal education, Cook was a man of great intelligence and unbounded curiosity, and his journals reflect a wide-ranging interest in everything from island customs to specific problems of navigation, charting, command, and diplomacy.This reprinting of selections from Cook's journals, edited by A. Grenfell Price, celebrates the bicentennial anniversary of his explorations. It abounds in descriptions of newly discovered plant species, particulars of coastline and land features, details of navigation, and impressions of the various Pacific peoples he encountered. Cook's was a many-faceted genius, able at once to grasp the complexities of mathematics necessary for navigation and mapping and the subtle intricacies of politics and negotiation. He often recorded his keen judgments of both subordinates and native chieftains and priests in a way that displays his own great spirit and humanity. Always solicitous of the health of his crewmen, he took great pains to insure proper diet and conditions of cleanliness, and he carefully described these measures in his journal. His tragic death at the hands of Hawaiian islanders is fully rendered from eyewitness accounts, and the implications of his discoveries to the expansion of scientific knowledge are clearly presented by the editor.Although Cook's journals will prove of inestimable value to historians, anthropologists, and students of the history of science, they can be enjoyed equally as lively narratives of high adventure and discovery. Any sympathetically roving imagination will take unbounded delight in this great classic of exploration by a most ""curious and restless son of Earth.""",0140436472,9780140436471),Paperback,Abridged,672 pages,"

","Ever since the dawn of human life on this planet, Man has always sought to understand Nature, his own place in the scheme of Creation and the purpose of Life itself. In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and determined to a large extent, the course of history. While some religions have been based on books, claimed by their adherents to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience. Al-Qur'an, the main source of the Islamic faith, is a book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains Divine guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur'an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age. Does the Qur'an pass this test? In this booklet, I intend to give an objective analysis of the Muslim belief regarding the Divine origin of the Qur'an, in the light of established scientific discoveries. There was a time, in the history of world civilization, when 'miracles', or what was perceived to be a miracle, took precedence over human reason and logic. But how do we define the term 'miracle'? A miracle is anything that takes place out of the normal course of life and for which humankind has no explanation. However, we must be careful before we accept something as a miracle. An article in `The Times of India', Mumbai, in 1993 reported that 'a saint' by the name 'Baba Pilot' claimed to have stayed continuously submerged under water in a tank for three consecutive days and nights. However, when reporters wanted to examine the base of the tank of water where he claimed to have performed this 'miraculous' feat, he refused to let them do so. He argued by asking as to how one could examine the womb of a mother that gives birth to a child. The `Baba' was hiding something. It as a gimmick simply to gain publicity. Surely, no modern man with even the slightest inkling towards rational thinking would accept such a 'miracle'. If such false miracles are the tests of divinity, then we would have to accept Mr. P.C. Sorcar, the world famous magician known for his ingenious magical tricks and illusions, as the best god-man. A book, claiming Divine origin, is in effect, claiming to be a miracle. Such a claim should be easily verifiable in any age, according to the standards of that age. Muslims believe, that the Qur'an is the last and final revelation of God, the miracle of miracles revealed as a mercy to humankind. This book Quran and Modern Science will investigate the veracity of this belief written by great scholar Dr. Zakir Naik.",B00GJSZJW6,B00GJSZJW6,,,44 pages,"

Seumas Milne revealed for the first time the astonishing lengths to which the government and its intelligence machine were prepared to go to destroy the power of Britain’s miners’ union. There was an enemy within. It was the secret services of the British state, operating inside the NUM itself.Milne revealed for the first time the astonishing lengths to which the government and its intelligence machine were prepared to go to destroy the power of Britain’s miners’ union. Using phoney bank deposits, staged cash drops, forged documents, agents provocateurs and unrelenting surveillance, M15 and police Special Branch set out to discredit Scargill and other miners’ leaders. Planted tales of corruption were seized on by the media and both Tory and Labour politicians in what became an unprecedentedly savage smear campaign.In this new edition, published for the twentieth anniversary of Britain’s most important postwar social confrontation, new material brings the story up to date  – and, in the wake of the Iraq war intelligence scandals, highlights the continuing threat posed by the security services to democracy today.",1844675084,9781844675081),Paperback,,440 pages,"

","""I had the impression that here painting itself comes to the foreground; I wondered if it would not be possible to go further in this direction.""Thus did the young Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky (1866–1944) react to his first viewing of Monet's Haystack, included in an 1895 Moscow exhibit of French Impressionists. It was his first perception of the dematerialization of an object and presaged the later development of his influential theories of non-objective art.During study and travel in Europe, the young artist breathed the heady atmosphere of artistic experimentation. Fauvism, Cubism, Symbolism, and other movements played an important role in the development of his own revolutionary approach to painting. Decrying literal representation, Kandinsky emphasized instead the importance of form, color, rhythm, and the artist's inner need in expressing reality.In Point and Line to Plane, one of the most influential books in 20th-century art, Kandinsky presents a detailed exposition of the inner dynamics of non-objective painting. Relying on his own unique terminology, he develops the idea of point as the ""proto-element"" of painting, the role of point in nature, music, and other art, and the combination of point and line that results in a unique visual language. He then turns to an absorbing discussion of line — the influence of force on line, lyric and dramatic qualities, and the translation of various phenomena into forms of linear expression. With profound artistic insight, Kandinsky points out the organic relationship of the elements of painting, touching on the role of texture, the element of time, and the relationship of all these elements to the basic material plane called upon to receive the content of a work of art.Originally published in 1926, this essay represents the mature flowering of ideas first expressed in Kandinsky's earlier seminal book, Concerning the Spiritual in Art. As an influential member of the Bauhaus school and a leading theoretician of abstract expressionism, Kandinsky helped formulate the modern artistic temperament. This book amply demonstrates the importance of his contribution and its profound effect on 20th-century art.",0486238083,9780486238081),Paperback,,192 pages,"

","Annihilate Me, Volume 1The business of love is dangerous.For Jennifer Kent, a recent MBA graduate who has been searching for work in Manhattan for four long months, time and money are running out. If she doesn't find work soon, she'll need to return to her native Maine, where the job situation is even more bleak. And where her abusive parents lie in wait.But when an unorthodox arrangement is proposed, Jennifer decides to take it. She agrees to be the ""girlfriend"" of Alexander Wenn, the reluctant, billionaire CEO of Wenn Enterprises, who is so devastatingly good looking, he needs a beautiful woman like Jennifer on his arm to ""keep the wolves at bay."" In this case, the wolves are other women, all of whom vie for his attention so aggressively, they keep him from focusing on business at the exclusive events he must attend. It's there that deals are cut. What they want is his money and his power. Damaged by a past event, the only thing Alex wants to do is focus on work. And to forget the past.But can Jennifer deny their white-hot chemistry? As she's swept into this glittering otherworld of society and big business, she finds herself struggling to keep from falling for Alex, an almost impossible feat she nevertheless must meet.Armed with her MBA, Jennifer Kent knows about business. But what she doesn't know is what could destroy her--the business of protecting her own heart. And maybe her own life.This story unfolds over multiple volumes approximately 50,000 words each.",B00CJGUHR4,B00CJGUHR4,Kindle Edition,,312 pages,"

It speaks for the millions of people all over the world who have lived suspended between their old and new countries, fitting into neither. An account not of the physical hardship and abuse suffered by many refugees, but rather an exploration of the subtler privations of psychological displacement and loss of identity.",1859845614,9781859845615),Paperback,,456 pages,"

","Kale Pani is a love story written on the back drop of cellular jail in Andaman during British rule in India. Since the book is written in pre-independence period, in the guise of love story it serves other purpose of nation building. It subtly pays homage to martyrs of 1857 revolution. It explains strategic importance of Andaman and describes nomadic tribes residing over there. The book also criticizes blind faith prevalent during that time. Savarkar also tells us about the hardships faced by prisoners in Andaman and how these criminal and political convicts helped turn this once inhabitable land into human society.",//<![CDATA[,Combine,Paperback,,288 pages,"

","Čudo u Poskokovoj Dragi Ante Tomića novi je fenomenalni, humoristički roman ispunjen sjajnim dijalozima, iznenadnim obratima i napetim filmičnim situacijama. Tomićevi likovi čitatelje će ponovno nasmijati do suza jer autor i dalje voli svoje likove, čak i kada se čini da im se pomalo ruga. Ironija kojom presvlači naizgled grubi i primitivni mentalitet laka je poput najfinije svile. Čudo u Poskokovoj Dragi sigurno je najkompleksnije autorovo ostvarenje do sada. Umješno ispreplićući elemente vodvilja, stare holivudske komedije, trilera, romana ceste i komedije zabune, Tomić je napisao divan humoristički roman koji će čitatelji odmah zavoljeti. Ovo je nedvojbeni dokaz jednog velikog spisateljskog umijeća – svi romaneskni elementi ovoga su puta našli svoje mjesto u jednoj slatko-gorkoj komediji, smještenoj u prepoznatljivom vremenu i prostoru.",9789533031545,9789533031545,Hardcover,,261 pages,"

","The P-NP problem is the most important open problem in computer science, if not all of mathematics. Simply stated, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly checked by computer can also be quickly solved by computer. The Golden Ticket provides a nontechnical introduction to P-NP, its rich history, and its algorithmic implications for everything we do with computers and beyond. Lance Fortnow traces the history and development of P-NP, giving examples from a variety of disciplines, including economics, physics, and biology. He explores problems that capture the full difficulty of the P-NP dilemma, from discovering the shortest route through all the rides at Disney World to finding large groups of friends on Facebook. The Golden Ticket explores what we truly can and cannot achieve computationally, describing the benefits and unexpected challenges of this compelling problem.",,,Hardcover,,176 pages,"

","Briar Thompson had it all. The right clothes, the right friends, the right car. Being popular was all that mattered. Her parents were rich and treated like royalty throughout the community. She thought her senior year of high school was going perfectly, until the night her drink was spiked at a party by one of her so called friends. That was the night she met Chase McCree. Chase wanted to go back to Montana. To the ranch and the wild, wide blue sky that went on forever. He wanted nothing to do with flashy cars or spoiled rich kids. But he found himself head over boots for the quirky cheerleader who turned her back on her social status. She befriended him when no one else would.

","La distanza tra la Nigeria e gli Stati Uniti è enorme, e non solo in termini di chilometri. Partire alla volta di un mondo nuovo abbandonando la propria vita è difficile, anche se quel mondo ha i tratti di un paradiso, ma per Ifemelu è necessario. Il suo paese è asfittico, l'università in sciopero. E poi, in fondo, sa che ad accoglierla troverà zia Uju e che Obinze, il suo ragazzo dai tempi del liceo, presto la raggiungerà. Arrivata in America, Ifemelu deve imparare un'altra volta a parlare e comportarsi. Diverso è l'accento, ma anche il significato delle parole. Ciò che era normale viene guardato con sospetto. Ciò che era un lusso viene dato per scontato. La nuova realtà, inclemente e fatta di conti da pagare, impone scelte estreme. La frattura con il passato, compresi gli affetti più cari, è inevitabile. A complicare tutto c'è la questione della pelle. Ifemelu non aveva mai saputo di essere nera: lo scopre negli Stati Uniti, dove la società sembra stratificata in base al colore. L'ostilità verso l'Altro ha tanti modi di esprimersi e passa anche attraverso cose apparentemente futili, come l'imperare di canoni specifici per l'acconciatura. Se le treccine sono bollate come poco professionali, l'afro va domato a litri di lisciante. Esasperata, Ifemelu decide di dare voce al proprio scontento dalle pagine di un blog. I suoi post, acuti e scevri di vittimismo, si conquistano velocemente un folto pubblico di lettori, che cresce e cresce fino ad aprire a Ifemelu imprevisti e fortunati sbocchi sul piano professionale e privato. Ma tra le pieghe del successo e di una relazione con tutte le carte in regola si fa strada un'insoddisfazione strisciante. Ifemelu si sente estranea alla sua stessa vita e, lì dov'è, non riesce ad affondare le radici, pur sapendo che in Nigeria le esperienze accumulate e il nuovo modo di guardare il mondo le guadagnerebbero l'epiteto spregiativo di «Americanah». Eppure il suo paese le manca, e le manca Obinze, ormai sposato e con una figlia. Ancora una volta, con coraggio, riempie la valigia e si prepara a un salto nel buio.",8806201018,9788806201012),Hardcover,Supercoralli,466 pages,"

Graduating early from high school leaves the spring semester free, so Haven and her friends Dante and Lance head to the Big Easy to volunteer with community service projects. But their true mission becomes clear when they run across an enclave of devils known as the Krewe. New Orleans is a free-for-all for these shape-shifting devils, who are more reckless and vicious than any Haven, Lance, and Dante have encountered. And they soon discover their French Quarter housemates are also angels-in-training, and together they must face off with the Krewe in their quest for wings. But Haven’s resolve is tested when Lucian, the repentant devil with whom she was infatuated, resurfaces and asks her for help escaping the underworld. Can he be trusted? Or will aiding him cost Haven her angel wings—and her life?

","On a damp October night, 24-year-old Ashley Cordova is found dead in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding Ashley's life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror film director Stanislaus Cordova--a man who hasn't been seen in public for more than thirty years. For McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about Cordova's dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself. Driven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into Cordova's eerie, hypnotic world. The last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career. This time he might lose even more.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,624 pages,"

Two weeks later on the dangerous high seas, the U.S. Navy covertly tracks a Chinese ship rumoured to carry tons of chemicals to create biological weapons of mass-destruction. The President cannot let the ship reach its destination - a rogue Middle East nation. But he doesn't want the navy to attack and board it either, because decades of negotiations with China have at long last yielded a landmark human rights agreement that China is willing to sign. Covert-One operative Jon Smith is brought in to find solid proof of what the Chinese ship is ferrying. Then an agent is murdered and vital evidence destroyed. Smith must find the truth about the ship, a truth that probes the deepest secrets of the Chinese ruling party...",0752858769,9780752858760),Unknown Binding,,,"

","B.J. Novak's One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories is an endlessly entertaining, surprisingly sensitive, and startlingly original debut collection that signals the arrival of a welcome new voice in American fiction.Across a dazzling range of subjects, themes, tones, and narrative voices, Novak's assured prose and expansive imagination introduce readers to people, places, and premises that are hilarious, insightful, provocative, and moving-often at the same time.In One More Thing, a boy wins a $100,000 prize in a box of Frosted Flakes - only to discover that claiming the winnings may unravel his family. A woman sets out to seduce motivational speaker Tony Robbins - turning for help to the famed motivator himself. A school principal unveils a bold plan to permanently abolish arithmetic. An acclaimed ambulance driver seeks the courage to follow his heart and throw it all away to be a singer-songwriter. Author John Grisham contemplates a monumental typo. A new arrival in heaven, overwhelmed by infinite options, procrastinates over his long-ago promise to visit his grandmother. We meet a vengeance-minded hare, obsessed with scoring a rematch against the tortoise who ruined his life; and post-college friends who debate how to stage an intervention in the era of Facebook. We learn why wearing a red t-shirt every day is the key to finding love; how February got its name; and why the stock market is sometimes just... down.Finding inspiration in questions from the nature of perfection to the icing on carrot cake, from the deeply familiar to the intoxicatingly imaginative, One More Thing finds its heart in the most human of phenomena: love, fear, family, ambition, and the inner stirring for the one elusive element that might make a person complete. The stories in this collection are like nothing else, but they have one thing in common: they share the playful humor, deep heart, inquisitive mind, and altogether electrifying spirit of a writer with a fierce devotion to the entertainment of the reader.",0804164738,9780804164733),Audio CD,,6 pages,"

","Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did; So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no-nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town, riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car and fly a plane. And, with her husband, Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one who is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle.Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds: against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit. Half Broke Horses is Laura Ingalls Wilder for adults, as riveting and dramatic as Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa or Beryl Markham's West with the Night.

Out of necessity, unconsciously and very successfully, Josephine donned a disguise to keep all others at bay. She led a globetrotting lifestyle on the fringes of the fashion and music elite, but she kept herself distant.  While Josephine was trotting the globe, retired boxer Jake Spear was living in the same small town as Lydia. There was nothing disguised about Jake. Including the fact he made a habit of making very bad decisions about who to give his love.  But for Josephine and Jake, there was one person who adored them.

The deal between leading mafia families has more on the line than anyone knew, even if the Bratva and Cosa Nostra shouldn’t mix. When Vine’s family is murdered and she’s left with nothing more than her grief to survive the mob world alone, she believes the arrangement won’t see the light of day. Anton can’t allow the one woman he was supposed to love get away. At the possibility of her death, he steps in to save her with guns blazing, knowing exactly what it might cost him: everything. But it’s been nearly a decade since their last meeting, and he can’t help but wonder if the woman he took back is the same girl he fell for all those years before.

When an old flame of Anton’s shows up to rip the veil off the carefully constructed secrets he’d been hiding, she learns that nothing about her life is as it seems. But, that’s nothing compared to the bomb about to blow. Can Vine see beyond the pain and blood to take what she always wanted? And just how far will the mob prince go to keep her safe?In a world where violence, deceit, and greed reign, your life is not your own, and sometimes, love has to be arranged.",1440580650,9781440580659),ebook,,346 pages,"

Instead, it is the historical unfolding of God’s covenantal involvement in this world, the culmination of which is God’s coming into this world in the person of Jesus Christ.Far as the Curse if Found is a retelling of the biblical story of God’s unfolding covenant from creation to new creation. Readers are led to wonder anew at the redemptive work of God in our own history, in our own human flesh.

"," Marriage - Seven Principles of Making Marriage Work   Marriage is a long journey, which needs both partners to be committed 100%. There are so many things that we will need to experience in marriage on our own before we can get the understanding of marriage in reality. A lot of times we are told that arguments in marriages are bad. Sometimes the quarrels that take place are about trivial things such as where to put the laundry basket, how to use the toothpaste, etc. which should not be so. This can be stopped or put to an end when every partner realizes that they are an important part of making the marriage work.  A good marriage has nothing to do with finding your soul mate or some unique person who will always make you happy. It is also not by chance or about being lucky. Here in this book you are going to know about how to make your marriage successful and will also learn about the seven principles that one must follow to make their marriage work. I am sure if you will apply these 7 principles in your married life, then it will be successful and you will lead a happy and healthy life with your partner.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,68 pages,"

Returning to his native Paris, Florent finds a city he barely recognizes, with its working classes displaced to make way for broad boulevards and bourgeois flats. Living with his brother's family in the newly rebuilt Les Halles market, Florent is soon caught up in a dangerous maelstrom of food and politics. Amid intrigue among the market's sellers—the fishmonger, the charcutiere, the fruit girl, and the cheese vendor—and the glorious culinary bounty of their labors, we see the dramatic difference between ""fat and thin"" (the rich and the poor) and how the widening gulf between them strains a city to the breaking point.",1933382724,9781933382722),Paperback,,660 pages,"

","With bracing clarity, Blinder shows us how the U.S. financial system, which had grown far too complex for its own good-and too unregulated for the public good-experienced a perfect storm beginning in 2007. When America's financial structure crumbled, the damage proved to be not only deep, but wide. It took the crisis for the world to discover, to its horror, just how truly interconnected-and fragile-the global financial system is. The second part of the story explains how American and international government intervention kept us from a total meltdown. Many of the U.S. government's actions, particularly the Fed's, were previously unimaginable. And to an amazing-and certainly misunderstood-extent, they worked. The worst did not happen. Blinder offers clear-eyed answers to the questions still before us, even if some of the choices ahead are as divisive as they are unavoidable. After the Music Stopped is an essential history that we cannot afford to forget, because one thing history teaches is that it will happen here again.",1594205302,9781594205309),Hardcover,,496 pages,"

The earth is slowly submerging beneath the expanding Sea of Corruption, an enormous toxic forest that creates mutant insects and releases a miasma of poisonous spores into the air. At the periphery of the sea, tiny kingdoms are scattered on tiny parcels of land. Here lies the Valley of the Wind, a kingdom of barely 500 citizens; a nation given fragile protection from the decaying sea's poisons by the ocean breezes; and home to Nausicaä .Nausicaä, a young princess, has an emphatic bond with the giant Ohmu insects and animals of every creed. She fights to create tolerance, understanding and patience among empires that are fighting over the world's remaining precious natural resources.",1591164087,9781591164081),Paperback,,130 pages,"

","As I walked away from New Buildings, I found the man that Lewis had called ""Tollers"" sitting on one of the stone steps in front of the arcade.""How did you get on?"" he asked.""I think rather well. I think he will be a most interesting tutor to have.""""Interesting? Yes, he's certainly that,"" said the man, who I later learned was J. R. R. Tolkien. ""You'll never get to the bottom of him.""Over the next twenty-nine years, author George Sayer's first impression about C. S. Lewis proved true. He was interesting; but he was more than just that. He was a devout Christian, gifted literary scholar, best-selling author, and brilliant apologist. Sayer draws from a variety of sources, including his close friendship with Lewis and the million-word diary of Lewis's brother, to paint a portrait of the man whose friends knew him as Jack.Offering glimpses into Lewis's extraordinary relationships and experiences, Jack details the great scholar's life at the Kilns; days at Magdalen College; meetings with the Inklings; marriage to Joy Davidman Gresham; and the creative process that produced such world-famous works as the classic Chronicles of Narnia, Mere Christianity, and The Screwtape Letters.This book is an intimate account of the man who helped--and through his works, continues to help--generations hear and understand the heart of Christianity.",1581347391,9781581347395),Paperback,,457 pages,"

Dakin wants three things more than anything else: to visit the farthest-away mountain, to meet a gargoyle, and to marry a prince. Everyone in her village thinks she's crazy, especially since no one has ever been to the farthest-away mountain. But one day, when she is nearly 15, she hears the mountain calling her.

","Laura is happily married, a mother, and a successful novelist. Although prey to night terrors, she is adept at smoothing the disorder of reality into controlled prose. Interweaving memory, conversation, and reflection, Walking Naked telescopes the whole of Laura's life—childhood, marriages, triumphs, and disappointments—into a day in which the past and the present converge. It begins with a game of tennis played for duty rather than amusement and progresses, via an afternoon party of old friends and jaded emotions, to a bewildering visit to Laura's son, who is imprisoned on a drugs charge. At its close, the possibility of death within the family brings unresolved conflicts to center stage, and Laura strips herself of the posturing and self-deceit with which she has cloaked her vulnerability. Continually surprising, witty, and often disquieting, this is one of Nina Bawden's most impressive novels.",185381444X,9781853814440),Paperback,Virago Modern Classics,221 pages,"

A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnatses. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the boys build character by spending all day, every day digging holes exactly five feet wide and five feet deep. There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. But there are an awful lot of holes.It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. But what could be buried under a dried-up lake? Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment--and redemption.Includes a double bonus: an excerpt from Small Steps,  the follow-up to Holes,  as well as an excerpt from Louis Sachar's new middle-grade novel, Fuzzy Mud.

","Recounting twelve significant battles, and the reverberating consequences of their outcomes, that took place in the American West between the United States and American Indians from 1854 to 1890, this book is filled with harrowing stories of sacrifice and misdeeds that are well documented in the annals of history, as well as others that are less well known. Commonly and callously referred to at the time as the ?Indian Problem, ? this issue, and how it was handled, became the defining factor in shaping how American Indians live today and reflects interestingly on how the American military currently handles conflicts with insurgents throughout the world. Eloquently written by award-winning author of Dances With Wolves, Michael Blake presents these conflicts with a perspective that goes beyond the basic facts of date, place, and outcome. Blake's insightful accounts of these battles finally answers the less pondered, more human questions about this crucial part of America's history. Blake's narrative shatters stereotypes, eloquently bringing to light the undercurrents of conflict between nations that are familiar themes to a contemporary audience. Further reading suggestions are offered at the end of each chapter.",0873589076,9780873589079),Hardcover,,170 pages,"

","Twenty year old Anderson ""Andi"" Kelly curses the day she got roped into helping plan the wedding of her cousin to her cheating ex-boyfriend. To save face, she tells everyone her boyfriend is megastar, Lucas Greyson--currently Hollywood's hottest actor. In reality, Luke is Andi's boss and a good friend--and vacationing out of the country at the moment. It's the perfect lie; what could go wrong?  She finds out the hard way when Luke unexpectedly shows up at her family's front door. Caught, Andi is forced to tell him about her little white lie--and to her horror, Luke decides he wants to maintain the charade. Left with no choice, she assumes the enviable role of Lucas Greyson's besotted girlfriend.  And that's when things start to get really complicated. As they help each other navigate through ex-boyfriends and conniving co-stars, Andi begins to look at her famous boss in a new light. Soon the line between real and make believe gets blurred, and she finds herself with a difficult choice to make: keep her heart safe and grounded...or shoot for the stars.

White Fang, by contrast, is the tale of a crossbreed who is three-quarters wolf and a quarter dog, and who must endure considerable suffering in the wilderness before being tamed by an American and taken to live in California. Extraordinary both for the vividness of their descriptions and the success with which they imagine life from a non-human perspective, Jack London's classics of children’s literature are two of the greatest and most popular animal stories ever written.This beautiful Macmillan Collector’s Library edition of The Call of the Wild & White Fang features an afterword by Sam Gilpin.Designed to appeal to the booklover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautiful gift editions of much-loved classic titles.

","Os textos de 'Papéis avulsos' são decisivos na constituição do cânone de Machado de Assis. Com esse livro, a narrativa curta é legitimada como gênero de primeira importância no Brasil. Escritos no mesmo período da renovação de 'Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas', os contos reunidos no volume sistematizam traços estilísticos da forma livre, com que Machado de Assis inscreve sua obra no grande diálogo internacional da sátira menipéia, fundada no humor paródico e no relativismo cético. Além de conter apurado estabelecimento de texto, que partiu da primeira edição de 'Papéis avulsos', o presente volume oferece longo ensaio de Ivan Teixeira, especialmente escrito para esta publicação. Nele, o professor de literatura brasileira da ECA/USP demonstra que, por trás de aparente dispersão, os contos do livro são marcados por rigorosa conformidade artística, até aqui praticamente desconsiderada pelos estudos machadianos.Contos:- O alienista- Teoria do medalhão- A chinela turca- Na arca- D.

","Non è solo musica, il jazz. È anche un modo di stare nel mondo, e un modo di stare con gli altri. Al cuore della sua ""filosofia"" ci sono l'unicità e il potenziale di ciascun individuo, uniti però alla sua capacità di ascoltare gli altri e improvvisare insieme a loro. È stato creato dai discendenti degli schiavi, ma sa parlare di libertà. È figlio della malinconia del blues, ma sa lasciarsi andare alla felicità più pura. Le sue radici sono nella tradizione, ma la sua sfida è la continua innovazione. E anche se vive di tensioni armoniche e ritmiche, ha saputo e sa essere ancora messaggero di pace. Wynton Marsalis fa leva sulla sua eccezionale storia artistica e sull'eredità dei grandi maestri per introdurci in questo universo fatto di opposti che si riconciliano. Con la passione del protagonista racconta storie del presente e del passato. Con la competenza dello studioso spiega cosa e come ascoltare. E soprattutto mostra come le idee centrali del jazz possano aiutare le persone e le comunità a cambiare il loro modo di pensare e di agire, con se stesse e le une con le altre.",8807722461,9788807722462),Paperback,Universale Economica Saggi,176 pages,"

","Na Judeia, há dois mil anos, uma antiga profecia se transforma em realidade. Jesus de Nazaré, descendente do rei David, se revela o Filho de Deus – o Messias salvador da Humanidade. Caminhando entre os homens, curando, afastando espíritos malignos, iluminando consciências, o Divino Rabi da Galileia desperta o ódio daqueles que exploram a religião, dos poderosos que temem perder o poder absoluto para o Rei dos Judeus. Salmos de redenção – revelação do Espírito Ferdinando, edição revisada e ampliada pelo autor, um dos primeiros seguidores do Mestre –, é um romance histórico, empolgante narrativa que resgata episódios emocionantes ocorridos no início da Era Cristã.

The triangle quickly excludes Shyam, Radha's husband, who can only watch helplessly as she embraces Chris with a passion that he has never been able to draw from her.

When her ne’er-do-well father learns that his family is the last of a long noble line, the d’Urbervilles, he sends Tess on a journey to meet her supposed kin—a journey that will see her victimized by lust, poverty, and hypocrisy. Shaped by an acute sense of social injustice and by a vision of human fate cosmic in scope, her story is a singular blending of harsh realism and poignant beauty. Thomas Hardy created in Tess not a standard Victorian heroine but a woman whose intense vitality shines against the bleak backdrop of a dying way of life.

","From Harper Lee comes a landmark new novel set two decades after her beloved Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb, Alabama. Twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise Finch - 'Scout' - returns home from New York City to visit her aging father, Atticus. Set against the backdrop of the civil rights tensions and political turmoil that were transforming the South, Jean Louise's homecoming turns bittersweet when she learns disturbing truths about her close-knit family, the town and the people dearest to her. Memories from her childhood flood back, and her values and assumptions are thrown into doubt. Featuring many of the iconic characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman perfectly captures a young woman, and a world, in a painful yet necessary transition out of the illusions of the past - a journey that can be guided only by one's conscience. Written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman imparts a fuller, richer understanding and appreciation of Harper Lee. Here is an unforgettable novel of wisdom, humanity, passion, humor and effortless precision - a profoundly affecting work of art that is both wonderfully evocative of another era and relevant to our own times. It not only confirms the enduring brilliance of To Kill a Mockingbird, but also serves as its essential companion, adding depth, context and new meaning to an American classic.",1785150286,9781785150289),Hardcover,,278 pages,"

","18 years old and fresh out of high school, Karl Ove Knausgaard moves to a tiny fisherman’s village far north of the polar circle to work as a school teacher. He has no interest in the job itself – or in any other job for that matter. His intention is to save up enough money to travel while finding the space and time to start his writing career. Initially everything looks fine: He writes his first few short stories, finds himself accepted by the hospitable locals and receives flattering attention from several beautiful local girls.But then, as the darkness of the long polar nights start to cover the beautiful landscape, Karl Ove’s life also takes a darker turn. The stories he writes tend to repeat themselves, his drinking escalates and causes some disturbing blackouts, his repeated attempts at losing his virginity end in humiliation and shame, and to his own distress he also develops romantic feelings towards one of his 13-year-old students. Along the way, there are flashbacks to his high school years and the roots of his current problems. And then there is the shadow of his father, whose sharply increasing alcohol consumption serves as an ominous backdrop to Karl Ove’s own lifestyle.",0099581523,9780099581529),Paperback,,560 pages,"

","1941, and England invaded – and defeated – by the Germans...The King is a hostage in the tower, the Queen and Princesses have fled to Australia, Churchill has been executed by a firing squad, Englishmen are being deported to work in German factories and the dreaded SS is in charge of Scotland Yard. London is in shock. The very look of daily life is a walking nightmare of German uniforms, artifacts, regulations. There are collaborators. There are profiteers. But there are others working in hope, in secret, and desperate danger, against the invader. And still others are living strangely ambiguous lives – none more so than Detective Superintendent Douglas Archer (""Archer of the yard"" as the press like to call him), trying to maintain a peculiarly, almost sacredly, British institution under a Nazi chief. Archer has started work on what seems, at first, a routine murder case. But suddenly an SS Standartenführer from Himmler's personal staff flies in from Berlin to supervise the investigation, and Archer is plunged deep into an espionage battle for which he is completely unprepared, and where the stakes are incredibly high. ""We’re dealing with something that could prove so deadly that not even the Black Death would compare with the consequences"", the SS man tells him.Setting forth on a tight rope trail of violence, betrayal and danger, Archer moves into worlds within worlds of intrigue. The British resistance, wealthy collaborators, high-level scientists, German army and SS factions and vicious rivalry, a beautiful American reporter on assignment for the still-neutral papers back home – these are the players that Deighton's treacherously shifting drama, as it races toward its chattering climax that involves the fate of the King, and of England itself.SS–GB is fascinating in its premise, utterly authentic and convincing in its detail. It is the most gripping novel we have had from the author of The Ipcress File, Funeral in Berlin, and Bomber. Already, in England, it has become Len Deighton's greatest best seller.",0345304543,9780345304544),Paperback,,375 pages,"

Four years ago, his tattooed, wise-cracking, rule-breaking roommate cut him off without an explanation. So what if things got a little weird on the last night of hockey camp the summer they were eighteen? It was just a little drunken foolishness. Nobody died.Ryan Wesley’s biggest regret is coaxing his very straight friend into a bet that pushed the boundaries of their relationship. Now, with their college teams set to face off at the national championship, he’ll finally get a chance to apologize. But all it takes is one look at his longtime crush, and the ache is stronger than ever.Jamie has waited a long time for answers, but walks away with only more questions—can one night of sex ruin a friendship?

Fulfilling the destiny predicted for her, she has established the Third Druid Council and dedicated herself to its goals of peace, harmony among the races, and defense of the Four Lands. But despite her devotion to the greater good as Ard Rhys, the High Druid of Paranor, Grianne still has bitter enemies. Even her few allies—chief among them her trusted servant Tagwen—know of the plots against her. But they could never anticipate the sudden, ominous disappearance of the Ard Rhys, in the dead of night and without a trace. Now Tagwen joins Grianne’s brave young nephew, Pen Ohmsford, and the wise, powerful elf Ahren Elessedil on a desperate and dangerous mission of search and rescue—to deliver the High Druid of Shannara from an unspeakable fate.BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Measure of the Magic.",0345483898,9780345483898),Paperback,,416 pages,"

","In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's classic, frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put out fires--they start them in order to burn books. Bradbury's vividly painted society holds up the appearance of happiness as the highest goal--a place where trivial information is good, and knowledge and ideas are bad. Fire Captain Beatty explains it this way, ""Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs.... Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.""  Guy Montag is a book-burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. His wife spends all day with her television ""family,"" imploring Montag to work harder so that they can afford a fourth TV wall. Their dull, empty life sharply contrasts with that of his next-door neighbor Clarisse, a young girl thrilled by the ideas in books, and more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless chatter of the tube. When Clarisse disappears mysteriously, Montag is moved to make some changes, and starts hiding books in his home. Eventually, his wife turns him in, and he must answer the call to burn his secret cache of books. After fleeing to avoid arrest, Montag winds up joining an outlaw band of scholars who keep the contents of books in their heads, waiting for the time society will once again need the wisdom of literature. Bradbury--the author of more than 500 short stories, novels, plays, and poems, including The Martian Chronicles and The Illustrated Man--is the winner of many awards, including the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. Readers ages 13 to 93 will be swept up in the harrowing suspense of Fahrenheit 451, and no doubt will join the hordes of Bradbury fans worldwide. --Neil Roseman",0345284828,9780345284822),Mass Market Paperback,,184 pages,"

","“THAT’S NO MOON.”–Obi-Wan KenobiThe Death Star’s name says it all, with bone-chilling accuracy. It is a virtual world unto itself–equipped with uncanny power for a singularly brutal purpose: to obliterate entire planets in the blink of an eye. Its annihilation of the planet Alderaan, at the merciless command of Grand Moff Tarkin, lives in infamy. And its own ultimate destruction, at the hands of Luke Skywalker, is the stuff of legend. But what is the whole story, and who are the players, behind the creation of this world-killing satellite of doom?The near extermination of the Jedi order cleared the way for Palpatine–power-hungry Senator and Sith Lord–to seize control of the Republic, declare himself Emperor, and usher in a fearsome, totalitarian regime. But even with the dreaded Darth Vader enforcing Palpatine’s sinister will, the threat of rebellion still looms. And the Emperor knows that only abject fear–and the ability to punish dissent with devastating consequences–can ensure his unchallenged control of the galaxy. Enter ambitious and ruthless government official Wilhuff Tarkin, architect of the Emperor’s terrifying dream come true. From inception to completion, construction of the unprecedented Death Star is awash in the intrigues, hidden agendas, unexpected revelations, and daring gambits of those involved on every level. The brightest minds and boldest egos, the most ambitious and corrupt, the desperate and the devious, all have a stake in the Death Star–and its potential to control the fate of the galaxy.Soldiers and slaves, loyalists and Rebels, spies and avengers, the innocent and the evil–all their paths and fates will cross and intertwine as the Death Star moves from its maiden voyage to its final showdown. And a shadowy chapter of Star Wars history is stunningly illuminated in a thrilling, unforgettable adventure.",0345477421,9780345477422),Hardcover,First Edition,363 pages,"

","One of the world's greatest suspense writers returns with this gripping, powerful new novel featuring Inspector Alan Banks, hailed by Michael Connelly as ""a man for all seasons.""Life. Death.Good. Evil.Innocence. Guilt.All can be found IN THE DARK PLACES.It's a double mystery: two young men have vanished, and the investigation leads to two troubling clues in two different locations.As Inspector Banks and his team scramble for answers, the inquiry takes an even darker turn when a truck careens off an icy road in a freak hailstorm. In the wreckage, rescuers find the driver, who was killed on impact, as well as another corpse . . . that of someone who was dead well before the crash.Snow falls. The body count rises. And Banks, perceptive and curious as ever, feels himself being drawn deeper into a web of crime . . . and at its center something—or someone—dark and dangerous lying in wait.Vibrating with tension, ingeniously plotted, and filled with soul and poignancy, In the Dark Places is a remarkable achievement from this masterful talent. For readers of Michael Connelly, Louise Penny, and Tess Gerritsen, this is a novel to be read with white knuckles and a fast-beating heart.",0771076428,9780771076428),Hardcover,,384 pages,"

","Dostoyevsky’s epic masterpiece, unabridged, with an afterword by Robin Feuer MillerOne of the world’s greatest novels, Crime and Punishment is the story of a murder and its consequences—an unparalleled tale of suspense set in the midst of nineteenth-century Russia’s troubled transition to the modern age. In the slums of czarist St. Petersburg lives young Raskolnikov, a sensitive, intellectual student. The poverty he has always known drives him to believe that he is exempt from moral law. But when he puts this belief to the test, he suffers unbearably. Crime and punishment, the novel reminds us, grow from the same seed. “No other novelist,” wrote Irving Howe of Dostoyevsky, “has dramatized so powerfully the values and dangers, the uses and corruptions of systematized thought.” And Friedrich Nietzsche called him “the only psychologist I have anything to learn from.”With an Introduction by Leonard J. Stanton and James D. Hardy Jr.and an Afterword by Robin Feuer Miller",English,English,Paperback,,560 pages,"

Now that she faces a future of exile and scorn, Gauri has nothing left to lose. But should she trust Vikram, the notoriously cunning prince of a neighboring land? He promises her freedom in exchange for her battle prowess. Together they can team up and win the Tournament of Wishes, a competition held in a mythical city where the Lord of Wealth promises a wish to the victor.

New trials will test their devotion, strength, and wits.

Aytmatov, kaçınılmaz olan bu çöküşü eserleriyle hızlandıran yazarların başında gelir.Yedigey, ölen emektar arkadaşı Kazangap’ın cenazesini mezarına götürürken, kendisinin ve milletinin geçmişini, acı-tatlı, düşündürücü yanlarıyla bir bir gözlerinin önünden geçirir. O gün “asra bedel bir gün olur” onun için. Sevdikleri kişinin cenazesini Nayman’ların kutsal mezarlığına götürdükleri zaman, orada bir uzay üssünün kurulmuş olduğunu görürler ve cenazenin gömülmesine izin verilmez. Öte yandan, Rus-Amerikan ortak araştırması sonunda kozmonotlar, uygarlık düzeyi Dünyanınkinden çok daha yüksek bir gezegen keşfederler. Bu gezegende yaşayanlar dünyalılarla ilişki kurmak isterler. Fakat daha yüksek bir uygarlığı, daha iyi bir yönetimi kendileri için zararlı gören dünyalı yöneticiler bu isteği reddederler. Kurgu-bilime dayanan bu bölüm, eseri asla bir kurgu-bilim romanı haline getirmez. Yazar bu eserde, geçmişi, bugünü ve yarını bir arada gözler önüne sermek ustalığı gösterir…Romanda derin ve temiz aşklar, efsane ve masallar, KGB’nin acımasız uygulamaları, okuru heyecandan heyecana sürükler. Aytmatov, o eşsiz anlatım gücü ile “insanlarımızı mankurt olmaktan kurtaralım” mesajını vermektedir. Neden mankurt? Bunu romanda anlatılan bir Nayman efsanesinden öğreniyoruz: Juan-Juan’lar, tutsak ettikleri genç savaşçılara, akıl almaz bir işkence usulü ile geçmişlerini unuttururlar. Geçmişini unutan tutsak, artık bir “mankurt”tur. Anasını babasını, çocuklarını bile tanımaz. Yeni efendisinin emriyle ve ona yaranmak için öz anasını öldürmekten çekinmez…Bu kadar da değil… Aytmatov, birbirinden ilginç ve sürükleyici konuları bütünleştirerek sunmasını en iyi bilen yazardır.",9758651099,9758651099,Paperback,,400 pages,"

","Acclaimed scientist Hope Jahren has built three laboratories in which she’s studied trees, flowers, seeds, and soil. Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more. Lab Girl is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.",1101874937,9781101874936),Hardcover,,290 pages,"

","FROM THE AUTHOR OF THE INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED SILISTRA QUARTET.  The cruisers called.  She answered.  Cruiser Dreams, Book II in the three-book Kerrion Empire saga Cruiser Dreams . . . She is heir to an empire beyond all imagining, where interstellar cruisers have become increasingly sentient and man's role among the stars is transformed.  In this epic of political treachery, interstellar security, human passion, and artificial intelligence, Morris continues the saga of the fiery girl Shebat, stolen away from a decaying and primitive Earth to become the adoptive heir to the Kerrion Empire. Molded to serve the designs of the Kerrion state, Shebat instead becomes the harbinger of change sweeping the civilized stars.  Against the chaotic background of simultaneous social and technological revolutions, Shebat struggles to face the fact that the man she loves is her implacable enemy, that the man she reluctantly married is perhaps her only ally, and that her space-faring cruiser may be her only true friend. Praise for Dream Dancer (use font from Dream Dancer cover) Book I in the three-part saga of the Kerrion Empire:  ""A fascinating and lyrical story, told with great invention..."" - Peter Straub, author of Shadowland and Ghost Story  ""Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity!"" Eric Van Lustbader, author of The Ninja and The Bourne Legacy.  Praise for Cruiser Dreams::  ""Packed with intrigue, spiced with romance . . ."" -- Publishers Weekly  ""Fascinating . . . Recommended!"" -- Booklist   Janet Morris is an international best-selling author who lives with her husband on Cape Cod.  Everything you've seen or read till now took you only to the brink . . .  Neither pure fantasy, nor straight science fiction, nor earthbound dynastic saga, Dream Dancer is a stunning amalgam of all three. It is a family saga with the epic appeal of Dune and the action and excitement of Star Wars. It is a saga of love, power and treachery that will appeal to men and women equally; full of action, compulsively readable and quite unlike anything being published in the realms of fantasy today.  The heroine, Shebat, is a remarkable girl from Earth. She is brought to the vast empire of the Kerrion family by a renegade son; named as its future ruler on a whim of his autocratic father; abducted to the slums where the Kerrions' slaves drug themselves with powerful mystical sorcery; and finally rescued to take part in a great rebellion. She falls in love with one brother but marries another and becomes more Kerrion than some born to the name. A magical seductress of men, passionate in her lust for power, Shebat moves among those who control the destinies of millions, for whom treachery and betrayal are as easy as murder.  Set in the timeless future on a primitive, savage Earth and on the sophisticated habitats of deep space, Dream Dancer is the first volume of a three-part saga. . ""Not since Dune have we witnessed a power struggle of such awesome intensity. Dream, Dancer may well be the I, Claudius of fantasy novels. A literary feast!"" - Eric Van Lustbader, author of The Ninja . ""Dream Dancer is a fascinating and lyrical story, told with great invention . . ."" -- Peter Straub, author of Ghost Story . ""The pacing is brisk; fascinating concepts abound."" -- Booklist ",B07G4DX3V3,B07G4DX3V3,Kindle Edition,,308 pages,"

","An enemy so intractable that it cannot be reasoned with. The entire race thinks with one mind and strives toward one purpose: to add our biological distinctiveness to their own and wipe out individuality, to make every living thing Borg.In over two centuries, the Federation has never encountered a greater threat. Twice Starfleet assembled and threw countless starships to stand against them. The Borg were stopped, the price paid in blood. Humanity breathed a sigh of relief, assuming it was safe. And with the destruction of the transwarp conduits, the Federation believed that the killing blow had finally been struck against the Borg.Driven to the point of extinction, the Borg continue to fight for their very existence, for their culture. They will not be denied. They must not be stopped. The old rules and assumptions regarding how the Collective should act have been dismissed. Now the Borg kill first, assimilate later.When the Enterprise manages to thwart them once again, the Borg turn inward. The dark places that even the drones never realized existed are turned outward against the enemy they have never been able to defeat.

Dopo i primi successi, però, accade qualcosa d'inspiegabile e alcuni uomini muoiono tra sofferenze atroci. Ben presto, Ryland si convince che l'unica speranza di sopravvivere per lui e i suoi compagni sia evadere da quella sorta di prigione, ma i suoi piani sono sconvolti dall'arrivo di Lily, una scienziata che, sin dall'infanzia, ha dimostrato notevoli capacità telepatiche e che potrebbe far luce sul mistero. Tra Ryland e la giovane donna si scatena infatti un'attrazione fisica e mentale irresistibile, che tuttavia nessuno coglie e che sfugge soprattutto al padre di Lily, responsabile dell'esperimento, cui però non sfugge l'enorme rischio che stanno correndo quegli uomini.

","Fantastyczna epopeja Władca Pierścieni to jedno z największych dzieł literackich. Tolkien tchnął nowe życie w dawne tradycje i na ich kanwie zbudował jedyną w swoim rodzaju powieść przygodową ze starożytną legendą i prostą ogólnoludzką prawdą moralną jako osnową. Wątki Hobbita zostały rozwinięte i podbudowane głębszą refleksją. Ogniwem łączącym obie powieści jest Pierścień - w trylogii już nie tylko magiczny przedmiot, lecz potężne narzędzie zła, decydujące o losach całego świata. Kaprysy historii XX wieku sprawiły, że dzieło Tolkiena stało się aktualne. Pisarz przeciwny był jednak odczytywaniu Władcy Pierścieni jako alegorii naszych czasów, uważając ją za zbyt wąską. W postaci hobbita Froda przedstawił bowiem uniwersalnego szarego człowieka każdej epoki. Ostatecznie przecież to nie potęga umysłu czy siła fizyczna staje się ratunkiem dla świata, ale zwykły odruch serca, czysto ludzka zdolność do okazania miłosierdzia, która pozwala zwyciężyć zło.W zamierzchłych czasach kowale elfów wykuli Pierścienie Mocy. Lecz Sauron, Mroczny Władca, stworzył w tajemnicy Jedyny Pierścień, napełniając go swą potęgą, aby rządził pozostałymi. Ale Pierścień zniknął i przepadł gdzieś w Śródziemiu. Minęło wiele wieków, zanim się odnalazł i trafił w ręce hobbita, którego przeznaczeniem stała się wędrówka do Krainy Cienia, by zniszczyć Jedyny Pierścień...Drużyna Pierścienia wyrusza z Shire. Żaden z uczestników wyprawy - hobbici Frodo, Sam, Pippin i Merry, czarodziej Gandalf, krasnolud Gimli, elf Legolas, Boromir z Gondoru i tajemniczy Obieżyświat - nie wie, co czeka u kresu podróży. Ale są pewni jednego: jeśli nie wypełnią misji, świat ogarną Ciemności...",8373194223,9788373194229),Hardcover,,534 pages,"

",""" Ce livre, dont le titre : Fleurs du Mal, - dit tout, est revêtu [...] d'une beauté sinistre et froide ; il a été fait avec fureur et patience. D'ailleurs, la preuve de sa valeur positive est dans tout le mal qu'on en dit. Le livre met les gens en fureur "", écrivait Baudelaire à sa mère, le 9 juillet 1857. La première édition des Fleurs du Mal venait d'être publiée ; le procès qui s'ensuivit allait donner raison au poète : six pièces furent condamnées au motif qu'elles "" conduisaient nécessairement à l'excitation des sens ""... En 1861 parut la seconde version des Fleurs du Mal, dont Baudelaire, peu avant sa mort. affirmait : "" Faut-il vous dire [...] que dans ce livre atroce, j'ai mis tout mon cœur, toute ma tendresse, toute ma religion (travestie), toute ma haine ? Il est vrai que j'écrirai le contraire, que je jurerai mes grands dieux que c'est un livre d'art pur, de singerie, de jonglerie ; et je mentirai comme un arracheur de dents "" (lettre à Ancelle du 18 février 1866).Introduction, notes, chronologie et bibliographie mises à jour par Jacques Dupont",2080712926,9782080712929),Paperback,,371 pages,"

","Eva was arrested by the Nazis on her fifteenth birthday and sent to Auschwitz. Her survival depended on endless strokes of luck, her own determination and the love and protection of her mother Fritzi, who was deported with her.When Auschwitz was liberated, Eva and Fritzi began the long journey home. They searched desperately for Eva's father and brother, from whom they had been separated. The news came some months later. Tragically, both men had been killed.Before the war, in Amsterdam, Eva had become friendly with a young girl called Anne Frank. Though their fates were very different, Eva's life was set to be entwined with her friend's for ever more, after her mother Fritzi married Anne's father Otto Frank in 1953.This is a searingly honest account of how an ordinary person survived the Holocaust. Eva's memories and descriptions are heartbreakingly clear, her account brings the horror as close as it can possibly be.But this is also an exploration of what happened next, of Eva's struggle to live with herself after the war and to continue the work of her step-father Otto, ensuring that the legacy of Anne Frank is never forgotten.",English,English,Hardcover,,336 pages,"

","Requiem per un campesino espanol"" was first published under the title Mosen Millan in Coleccion Aquelarre, Mexico, 1953. The present text follows the first Spanish edition published by Destino, Barcelona, 1974, which bears a few minor variants, mainly in paragraph structure. It has been reprinted a number of times and translated into many languages and is one of the most widely read Spanish texts in the 20th century. This edition is aimed primarily at sixth-formers and university undergraduates and the introduction and notes have been compiled in the light of recent socio-politial topic-based syllabuses and communication studies courses. The inclusion in the introduction of a substantial section on the now out-of-print ""Contraataque"" (1937), the wartime narrative which contains the germ of the post-war novel, is intended to provide the student with a context for the study of the process in Sender's writing inspired by the Civil War - from explicit militant propaganda penned in the heat of battle to implicit poetic parable, historical emotion recollected in the comparative tranquillity and distance of exile. It is hoped that such a juxtaposition will illuminate both the content and literary achievement of ""Requiem",842330860X,9788423308606),Hardcover,,,"

Somehow The Crimson Kiss (a romance novel she’s become obsessed with) and Four Steps to Living Your Fantasy (a self-help book she’s reading) have fused in Evangeline’s mind and sent her on a quest for a kiss. But the path to perfection is paved with many bad kisses—the smash mouth, the ear licker, the “misser.” The phrase “I don’t kiss and tell” means nothing to the boys in her school. And worse: someone starts writing her name and number on bathroom walls. And worst of all: the boy she's just kissed turns out to be her best friend’s new crush.

In response to the interest of millions of Patrick O'Brian fans, here is the final, partial installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series.
Blue at the Mizzen (novel #20) ended with Jack Aubrey getting the news, in Chile, of his elevation to flag rank: Rear Admiral of the Blue Squadron, with orders to sail to the South Africa station. The next novel, unfinished and untitled at the time of the author's death, would have been the chronicle of that mission, and much else besides. The three chapters left on O'Brian's desk at the time of his death are presented here both in printed version-including his corrections to the typescript-and a facsimile of his manuscript, which goes several pages beyond the end of the typescript to include a duel between Stephen Maturin and an impertinent officer who is courting his fiancée.  Of course we would rather have had the whole story; instead we have this proof that O'Brian's powers of observation, his humor, and his understanding of his characters were undiminished to the end.",039306025X,9780393060256),Hardcover,,144 pages,"

","In the wake of Sassy and as an alternative to the more staid reporting of Ms. Magazine, Bitch was launched in the mid-nineties as a Xerox-and-staple zine covering the landscape of popular culture from a feminist perspective. Both unabashed in its love for the guilty pleasures of consumer culture and deeply thoughtful about the way the pop landscape reflects and impacts women's lives, Bitch grew to be a popular, full-scale magazine with a readership that stretched worldwide. Today it stands as a touchstone of hip, young feminist thought, looking with both wit and irreverence at the way pop culture informs feminism--and vice versa--and encouraging readers to think critically about the messages lurking behind our favorite television shows, movies, music, books, blogs, and the like. BITCHFest offers an assortment of the most provocative essays, reporting, rants, and raves from the magazine's first ten years, along with new pieces written especially for the collection. Smart, nuanced, cranky, outrageous, and clear-eyed, the anthology covers everything from a 1996 celebration of pre-scandal Martha Stewart to a more recent critical look at the ""gayby boom""; from a time line of black women on sitcoms to an analysis of fat suits as the new blackface; from an attempt to fashion a feminist vulgarity to a reclamation of female virginity. It's a recent history of feminist pop-culture critique and an arrow toward feminism's future.",0374113432,9780374113438),Paperback,,372 pages,"

","Na-o-mi. The three syllables of this name, unusual in 1920s Japan, captivate a 28-year-old engineer, who soon becomes infatuated with the girl so named, a teenaged café waitress. Drawn to her Eurasian features and innocent demeanor, Joji is eager to whisk young Naomi away from the seamy underbelly of post—World War I Tokyo and to mold her into his ideal wife. But when the two come together to indulge their shared passion for Western culture, Joji discovers that Naomi is far from being the naïve girl of his fantasies, and his passion descends into a comically helpless masochism.A literary masterpiece that helped to establish Junichiro Tanizaki as Japan's greatest novelist, Naomi is both a hilarious story of one man's obsession and torment, and a brilliant evocation of a nation's cultural confusion.",0865474575,9780865474574),Paperback,,237 pages,"

","Ethan and Derek Taggart: they're the men of Gemini, and when it comes to sheet-scorching undercover work, nobody does it better. The only one they answer to is big brother Danny--that is, until the right women come along to grab the reins and crack the whip as hard as the Taggart men like it. . .  Security is Derek Taggart's game, and he plays it straight--no margin for error, no time to fool around. . .except with one hot little number who changes everything. He takes her home when she needs a ride--one she'll never forget. The problem is Derek can't forget her, a total about-face for a guy who keeps his enemies closer than his lovers. Then he finds out the sexy dynamo is Alyssa Miles, notorious party girl and darling of the gossip rags. It's time to walk away and never look back, which would be a hell of a lot easier if his agency didn't desperately need the high-profile gig her family's offering: a minor detail that consists mainly of Derek watching Alyssa 24/7. Keeping an eagle eye on every inch of Alyssa's nubile body isn't exactly a hardship--the problem is keeping his hands off and his brain on when things go dangerously wrong. . .",0758225474,9780758225474),Audible Audio,,,"

She shoots him at a hunting party--accidentally, of course. Though the shot grazes his shoulder, her beauty pierces his heart.

","A fateful mistake... Stepping into the wrong carriage at a Sussex village, Elinor Rochdale is swept up in a thrilling and dangerous adventure. Elinor is rather surprised that her prospective employer is quite rich, and more so at tile decayed grandeur of the house to which she is transported. Elinor thought she was entering Highnoons as a governess, but Eduard Carlyon, the handsomely fashionable gentleman who carefully interviewed her obviously needed no governess. Carlyon was seeking a wife-not for himself, but for his young cousin, Eustace Cheviot, the dissipated and profligate owner of the ruined estate, who now lay on his deathbed. Surprised and repulsed as she was by this strange proposal, Elinor was nevertheless unable to resist Carlyon and his mystifying plans. Ned persuades Elinor to marry his cousin as a simple business arrangement.A momentous decision... And so in the short span of a few hours would-be governess became a bride - and a widow almost as soon as the ring is on her finger. Even as she assumed the duties of mistress of Highnoons, even as she tried to solve the puzzle that placed her in this unusual situation, Elinor found herself inextricably- drawn to Ned Carlyon, the aloof, caustic man who treated her with nothing more than cousinly respect - the last thing that spirited Elinor wanted.... As partner in a secret conspiracy to save a family's name she finds herself embroiled with uninvited guests, housebreakers, missing government papers, an Napoleonic spy ring, and a shocking murder. And mysterious conspirator Lord Carlyon won't let her leave....",0099468077,9780099468073),Paperback,,278 pages,"

","“I only know one man who might be able to tell me where I come from, and that man is a liar and a fraud.”  As far back as he can remember, the orphan Grady has tramped from village to village in the company of a huckster named Floyd. With his adolescent accomplice, Floyd perpetrates a variety of hoaxes and flimflams on the good citizens of the Corenwald frontier, such as the Ugliest Boy in the World act. It’s a hard way to make a living, made harder by the memory of fatter times when audiences thronged to see young Grady perform as “The Wild Man of the Feechiefen Swamp.” But what can they do? Nobody believes in feechies anymore.  When Floyd stages an elaborate plot to revive Corenwalders’ belief in the mythical swamp-dwellers known as the feechiefolk, he overshoots the mark. Floyd’s Great Feechie Scare becomes widespread panic. Eager audiences become angry mobs, and in the ensuing chaos, the Charlatan’s Boy discovers the truth that has evaded him all his life—and will change his path forever.",English,English,Paperback,,320 pages,"

A Tale of Two Gentlemen's Marriages to Two Most Devoted Sisters
 Three days before their double wedding, Charles Bingley is desperate to have a word with his dear friend Fitzwilliam Darcy, seeking advice of a most delicate nature. Bingley is shocked when Darcy gives him a copy of The Kama Sutra - but it does tell him everything he needs to know. Eventually, of course, Jane finds this remarkable volume and in utmost secrecy shows it to her dear sister Elizabeth, who goes searching for a copy in the Pemberley library... By turns hilarious and sweet, The Darcys & the Bingleys follows the two couples and the cast of characters surrounding them. Miss Caroline Bingley, it turns out, has such good reasons for being the way she is that the reader can't help but hold her in charity. Delightfully, she makes a most eligible match, and in spite of Darcy's abhorrence of being asked for advice, he and Bingley have a most enduring and adventure-prone friendship.",Pride,#1,Nook,,434 pages,"

","“To the novel—everyone’s novel—Sorrentino brings honor, tradition, and relentless passion.”—Don DeLillo“Sorrentino [is] a writer like no other. He’s learned, companionable, ribald, brave, mathematical, at once virtuosic and somehow without ego. Sorrentino’s books break free of the routine that inevitably accompanies traditional narrative and through a passionate renunciation shine with an unforgiving, yet cleansing, light.”—Jeffrey Eugenides“For a compelling, hilarious, and ultimately compassionate rendering of life in mid-20th-century America, forget the conscientious subjectors and take Gilbert Sorrentino at his golden Word.”—Harry Mathews“One of [Brooklyn]’s most intriguing and authentic homegrown talents, Sorrentino’s Bay Ridge deserves to be appreciated alongside Malamud’s Crown Heights, Arthur Miller’s Coney Island, Henry Miller’s and Betty Smith’s Williamsburg, Hamill’s and Auster’s Park Slope, and Lethem’s Boerum Hill.”—BookforumTitled after a line from Henry James, Gilbert Sorrentino’s final novel consists of fifty narrative set pieces full of savage humor and cathartic passion—an elegiac paean to the bleak world he so brilliantly captured in his long and storied career. Mirroring the inexplicable coincidences, encounters, and hallmarks of modern life, this novel revisits familiar characters—the aging artists, miserable couples, crackerjack salesmen, and drunken soldiers of previous books, placing them in familiar landscapes lost in time between the Depression era and some fraudulent bohemia of the present.A luminary of American literature, Gilbert Sorrentino was a boyhood friend of Hubert Selby, Jr., a confidant of William Carlos Williams, a two-time PEN/Faulkner Award finalist, and the recipient of a Lannan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award. He taught at Stanford for many years before returning to his native Brooklyn and published over thirty books before his death in 2006.",English,English,Paperback,,144 pages,"

","The vivid, often startling memoir of a young woman shaped by two dramatically disparate worlds. Saira Shah is the English-born daughter of an Afghan aristocrat, inspired by his dazzling stories to rediscover the now lost life their forebears presided over for nine hundred years within sight of the minarets and lush gardens of Kabul and the snow-topped mountains of the Hindu Kush. Part sophisticated, sensitive Western liberal, part fearless, passionate Afghan, falling in love with her ancestral myth-chasing Afghanistan-Shah becomes, at twenty-one, a correspondent at the front of the war between the Soviets and the Afghan resistance. Then, imprisoning herself in a burqa, she risks her life to film Beneath the Veil, her acclaimed record of the devastation of women's lives by the Taliban. Discovering her extended family, discovering a world of intense family ritual, of community, of male primacy, of arranged marriages, and finding at last the now war-ravaged family seat, she discovers as well what she wants and what she rejects of her extraordinary heritage.About the Author: Saira Shah lives in London and is a freelance journalist. She was born in Britain of an Afghan family, the daughter of Idries Shah, a writer of Sufi fables. She first visited Afghanistan at age twenty-one and worked there for three years as a freelance journalist, covering the guerilla war against the Soviet occupiers. Later, working for Britain's Channel 4 News, she covered some of the world's most troubled spots, including Algeria, Kosovo, and Kinshasa, as well as Baghdad and other parts of the Middle East. Her documentary Beneath the Veil was broadcast on CNN.",1400031478,9781400031474),Paperback,,272 pages,"

","A sleeper hit when first published in 1986, Jeannette Haien's exquisite, beloved first novel is a deceptively simple story that has the power and resonance of myth. The story begins on a rainy morning as Father Declan de Loughry stands fishing in an Irish salmon stream, pondering the recent deathbed confession of one of his parishioners. Kevin Dennehy and his wife, Enda, have been sweetly living a lie for some 50 years, a lie the full extent of which Father Declan learns only when Enda finally confides ""the all of it."" Her tale of suffering mesmerizes the priest, who recognizes that it is also a tale of sin and scandal, a transgression he cannot ignore. The resolution of his dilemma is a triumph of strength and empathy that, as Benedict Kiely has said, makes The All of It  ""a book to remember"".",087923623X,9780879236236),Hardcover,,145 pages,"

","Le célèbre roman de Germaine Guèvremont raconte l’arrivée d’un étranger, un soir d’automne, dans une famille du Chenal du Moine, près de Sorel. Le passage du Survenant transforme complètement la vie de cette petite communauté jusque-là fermée au monde. L’habile inconnu conquiert rapidement l’admiration du père Didace, qui l’aimerait bien comme fils, d’autant qu’Amable, son unique enfant, est malhabile, insignifiant et paresseux. Angélina, la fille du voisin, qui n’a jamais eu de succès auprès des hommes, s’épanouit au contact de l’étranger. Celui-ci repart comme il est venu, non sans avoir suscité de grandes rivalités dans son entourage. On parle dès lors de l’avant et de l’après Survenant. Roman régionaliste, Le Survenant est d’abord et avant tout un grand roman d’amour et de liberté. En 2005, l’œuvre est adaptée pour le cinéma, sur un scénario de Diane Cailhier et dans une réalisation d’Érik Canuel, avec Jean-Nicolas Verreault dans le rôle titre.",2894060440,9782894060445),Paperback,,221 pages,"

","New York State Assemblyman, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, New York City Police Commissioner, Governor of New York, Vice President and, at forty-two, the youngest President ever-in his own words, Theodore Roosevelt “rose like a rocket.” He was also a cowboy, a soldier, a historian, an intrepid explorer, and an unsurpassed environmentalist-all in all, perhaps the most accomplished Chief Executive in our nation’s history. In Lion in the White House: A Life of Theodore Roosevelt, historian Aida Donald masterfully chronicles the life of this first modern president. TR’s accomplishments in office were immense. As President, Roosevelt redesigned the office of Chief Executive and the workings of the Republican Party to meet the challenges of the new industrial economy. Believing that the emerging aristocracy of wealth represented a genuine threat to democracy, TR broke trusts to curb the rapacity of big business. He improved economic and social conditions for the average American. Roosevelt built the Panama Canal and engaged the country in world affairs, putting a temporary end to American isolationism. And he won the Nobel Peace Prize-the only sitting president ever so honored. Throughout his public career, TR fought valiantly to steer the GOP back to its noblest ideals as embodied by Abraham Lincoln. Alas, his hopes for his party were quashed by the GOP’s strong rightward turn in the years after he left office. But his vision for America lives on. In lapidary prose, this concise biography recounts the courageous life of one of the greatest leaders our nation has ever known.",0465002137,9780465002139),Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","Written between 1920 and 1937, when F. Scott Fitzgerald was at the height of his creative powers, these ten lyric tales represent some of the author's finest fiction. In them, Fitzgerald creates vivid, timeless characters -- a dissatisfied southern belle seeking adventure in the north; the tragic hero of the title story who lost more than money in the stock market; giddy and dissipated young men and women of the interwar period. From the lazy town of Tarleton, Georgia, to the glittering cosmopolitan centers of New York and Paris, Fitzgerald brings the society of the ""Lost Generation"" to life in these masterfully crafted gems, showcasing the many gifts of one of our most popular writers.",0684824485,9780684824482),Paperback,,260 pages,"

Thus mourned Ester Ried, for it seemed to her that her days consisted of nothing but monotony. Every day she made beds, baked endless pies in a hot kitchen, ironed, and raced against the clock to get tea on the table for the boarders. Every evening she fell into bed, too weary even for prayers, much less any Bible reading. As she nursed her suffering soul, she snapped at her sisters and brother until her very crossness added still more to her suffering and made her crosser still!Then a letter arrived from a well-to-do cousin in New York City—and thing ""did"" begin to happen. Ester was invited for a visit, and when she accepted, she had no idea that the coming days would change her life in ways she had never imagined.Heartwarming stories of faith and love by Grace Livingston Hill's aunt—Isabella Alden.

","Pilot, navigator, engineer, doctor, scientist--ship's cat? All are essential to the well-staffed space vessel. Since the early days of interstellar travel, when Tuxedo Thomas, a Maine coon cat, showed what a cat could do for a ship and its crew, the so-called Barque Cats have become highly prized crew members. Thomas's carefully bred progeny, ably assisted by humans--Cat Persons--with whom they share a deep and loving bond, now travel the galaxy, responsible for keeping spacecraft free of vermin, for alerting human crews to potential environmental hazards, and for acting as morale officers. Even among Barque Cats, Chessie is something special. Her pedigree, skills, and intelligence, as well as the close rapport she has with her human, Janina, make her the most valuable crew member aboard the Molly Daise. And the litter of kittens in her belly only adds to her value. Then the unthinkable happens. Chessie is kidnapped--er, catnapped--from Dr. Jared Vlast's vet clinic at Hood Station by a grizzled spacer named Carl Poindexter. But Chessie's newborn kittens turn out to be even more extraordinary than their mother. For while Chessie's connection to Janina is close and intuitive, the bond that the kitten Chester forms with Carl's son, Jubal, is downright telepathic. And when Chester is sent into space to learn his trade, neither he nor Jubal will rest until they're reunited.  But the announcement of a widespread epidemic affecting livestock on numerous planets throws their future into doubt. Suddenly the galactic government announces a plan to impound and possibly destroy all exposed animals. Not even the Barque Cats will be spared.  With the clock racing against them, Janina, Jubal, Dr. Vlast, and a handful of very special kittens will join forces with the mysterious Pshaw-Ra--an alien-looking cat with a hidden agenda--to save the Barque Cats, other animals, and quite possibly the universe as they know it from total destruction.",0345513762,9780345513762),Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","The world of the samurai - the legendary elite warrior cult of old Japan - has for too long been associated solely with military history and has remained a mystery to the general reader. In this exciting new book, Stephen Turnbull, the world's leading authority on the samurai, goes beyond the battlefield to paint a picture of the samurai as they really were. Familiar topics such as the cult of suicide, ritualised revenge and the lore of the samurai sword are seen in the context of an all-encompassing warrior culture that was expressed through art and poetry as much as through violence. Using themed chapters, the book studies the samurai through their historical development and their relationship to the world around them - relationships that are shown to persist in Japan even today.",1841769517,9781841769516),Paperback,,224 pages,"

Men who shrugged, men who ran, men who fought and tragic men like Mathieu, who had dedicated his life to finding personal freedom, now overwhelmed by remorse and bitterness, who must learn to kill. Iron in the Soul, the third volume of Sartre's Roads to Freedom Trilogy, is a harrowing depiction of war, and what it means to lose.",0141186577,9780141186573),Paperback,,348 pages,"

James may or may not be the center of the universe-as he thinks-but there's no arguing that he is indeed at the heart of one of the most inventive ""kid"" strips to hit the funny pages in almost a decade.With his equally lovable and quirky conspirators along for the ride, James explores the world and himself-laying bare the fragile and eccentric humanity in all of us. In a neighborhood where shirt gerbils prance and hungry shadows raid refrigerators, James chugs life like a summertime slurpy-without the brain freeze.Using his clean spontaneous pen line, Mark Tonra again marries insight and whimsy to deliver a book that's both hilarious and enlightening. Hey, James! is a satisfying celebration of every reader's inner and outer child. Enjoy!",9789726629412,9789726629412,Paperback,,128 pages,"

In fact, she's an unconventional princess who spends her days trying to disprove the nonsensical ideas of magic and myth. As she stands on the edge of achieving the life she has only dreamed about, Sondra's handsome suitor, Derek, prepares to propose, and her poverty-stricken kingdom of Ariva uncovers a valuable resource that will change its future forever.  Everything seems perfect in Sondra's life until she encounters a wizard who transforms her into a monstrous dragon. Forced to flee from the man she adores, Sondra blunders into the territory of Tolmac, a powerful and ancient black dragon.  Instead of killing her as she anticipates, Tolmac takes her under his wing, unknowingly training the human princess in the fine art of being a dragon. As Sondra soon discovers, she must constantly sacrifice to make the right choices as she grows to love and admire her new mentor. With her homeland poised on the brink of war, Sondra finds herself facing an unbearable decision; she must choose between her heart and her duty to her country.",The,#1,Paperback,,255 pages,"

","THE STONE ANGEL is the portrait of a proud, energetic and impulsive woman - Hagar Shipley - as seen through her own eyes at the age of ninety. Her reflections on her past form a vividly-etched chronicle of a girlhood shaped and dominated by her father; of a breakaway marriage to a virile but negligent farmer; of her complex ties to two sons - the conventional Marvin, and the flamboyant, adored John, whom she eventually destroys. Hagar in widowhood is still fiercely responsible, still armored by her steely humor, still isolated by her life-long habits of pride and self-reliance. But she does not remain untouched. In Hagar's ultimate self-confrontation, her final reckoning of the wages of love, Margaret Laurence has created one of contemporary literature's most stunning images of a woman's fate.THE STONE ANGEL is the first part of the acclaimed Manawaka series which also includes A Jest of God, The Fire-Dwellers, A Bird in the House, and The Diviners.",English,English,Paperback,,280 pages,"

","A page-turning epic about the making of a borderland crime family, Country of the Bad Wolfes will appeal both to aficionados of family sagas and to fans of hard-knuckled crime novels by the likes of Donald Pollack, Elmore Leonard, James Lee Burke and James Ellroy.Basing the novel partly on his own ancestors, Blake presents the story of the Wolfe family — spanning three generations, centering on two sets of identical twins and the women they love, and ranging from New England to the heart of Mexico before arriving at its powerful climax at the Rio Grande.Begat by an Irish-English pirate in New Hampshire in 1828, the Wolfe family follows its manifest destiny into war-torn Mexico. There, through the connection of a mysterious American named Edward Little, their fortunes intertwine with those of Porfirio Díaz, who will rule the country for more than thirty years before his overthrow by the Revolution of 1910. In the course of those tumultuous chapters in American and Mexican history, as Díaz grows in power, the Wolfes grow rich and forge a violent history of their own, spawning a fearsome legacy that will pursue them to a climactic reckoning at the Río Grande.A master of the historical novel, James Carlos Blake has been hailed as “a poet of the damned who writes like an angel” (Donald Newlove, Kirkus Reviews). Library Journal says of Blake's latest novel that it is ""brawling, high-spirited, and superbly realized ... this novel offers many pleasures, including endearing characters, unlikely love stories, and all manner of mayhem.""James Carlos Blake was born in Mexico and grew up in Texas and Florida. He is the author of nine other novels and a collection of short works. Among his literary honors are the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, the Southwest Book Award, and the Falcon Award.",English,English,Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Here is the story of Jerry Weintraub: the self-made, Brooklyn-born, Bronx-raised impresario, Hollywood producer, legendary deal maker, and friend of politicians and stars. No matter where nature has placed him--the club rooms of Brooklyn, the Mafia dives of New York's Lower East Side, the wilds of Alaska, or the hills of Hollywood--he has found a way to put on a show and sell tickets at the door. ""All life was a theater and I wanted to put it up on a stage,"" he writes. ""I wanted to set the world under a marquee that read: 'Jerry Weintraub Presents.'""In WHEN I STOP TALKING, YOU'LL KNOW I'M DEAD, we follow Weintraub from his first great success at age twenty-six with Elvis Presley, whom he took on the road with the help of Colonel Tom Parker; to the immortal days with Sinatra and Rat Pack glory; to his crowning hits as a movie producer, starting with Robert Altman and Nashville, continuing with Oh, God!, The Karate Kid movies, and Diner, among others, and summiting with Steven Soderbergh and Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen.Along the way, we'll watch as Jerry moves from the poker tables of Palm Springs (the games went on for days), to the power rooms of Hollywood, to the halls of the White House, to Red Square in Moscow and the Great Palace in Beijing-all the while counseling potentates, poets, and kings, with clients and confidants like George Clooney, Bruce Willis, George H. W. Bush, Armand Hammer, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, John Denver, Bobby Fischer . . .well, the list goes on forever.And of course, the story is not yet over . . .as the old-timers say, ""The best is yet to come.""As Weintraub says, ""When I stop talking, you'll know I'm dead.""With wit, wisdom, and the cool confidence that has colored his remarkable career, Jerry chronicles a quintessentially American journey, one marked by luck, love, and improvisation. The stories he tells and the lessons we learn are essential, not just for those who love movies and music, but for businessmen, entrepreneurs, artists . . . everyone.",English,English,Hardcover,,291 pages,"

","“Hall, whose Beyond Culture and The Silent Language won a wider readership, has written a ground-breaking investigation of the ways we use and abuse time, rich in insights applicable to our lives. Business readers will enjoy the cross-cultural comparison of American know-how with practices of compartmentalized German, centralized French, and ceremonious Japanese firms.”— Publishers WeeklyIn his pioneering work The Hidden Dimension, Edward T. Hall spoke of different cultures’ concepts of space. The Dance of Life reveals the ways in which individuals in culture are tied together by invisible threads of rhythm and yet isolated from each other by hidden walls of time. Hall shows how time is an organizer of activities, a synthesizer and integrator, and a special language that reveals how we really feel about each other. Time plays a central role in the diversity of cultures such as the American and the Japanese, which Hall shows to be mirror images of each other. He also deals with how time influences relations among Western Europeans, Latin Americans, Anglo-Americans, and Native Americans.First published in 1983, this book studies how people are tied together and yet isolated by hidden threads of rhythm and walls of time.  Time is treated as a language, organizer, and message system revealing people's feelings about each other and reflecting differences between cultures.",0385192487,9780385192484),Paperback,,256 pages,"

Instead of blowing away drug dealers, he kills three innocent people, their deaths starting an investigation that sees him and his conscience heading for trouble.Less than twelve hours later, Milne is out on the streets again. Eighteen-year-old Miriam Fox has been found dead by Regent's Canal---her throat slashed.

","Life for Irene Spencer was a series of devastating disappointments and hardships. Irene's first book, Shattered Dreams, is the staggering chronicle of her struggle to provide for her children in abject poverty and feelings of abandonment each time her husband left to be with one of his other wives. Irene was raised to believe polygamy was the way of life necessary for her ticket to heaven. The hard knocks of her environment were just the beginning of Irene's shocking tale. Insanity ran rampant in her husband's family and was the source of inconceivable events that unfolded throughout Irene's adult life. CULT INSANITY takes readers deeper into her story to uncover the outrageous behavior of her brother-in-law Ervil -- a self-proclaimed prophet who determined he was called to set the house of God in order -- and how he terrorized their colony. Claiming to be God's avenger and to have a license to kill in the name of God, Ervil ordered the murders of friends and family members, eliminating all those who challenged his authority. For those who were gripped by Shattered Dreams, the rest of the story will blow them away. CULT INSANITY is a riveting, terrifying memoir of polygamist life under the tyranny of a madman.",0446538191,9780446538190),Hardcover,,330 pages,"

Now, they’re hiding out in an abandoned house in Vancouver with a ragtag group of surviving teens, and trying to figure out their next move.

","The Descent of Woman is a pioneering work, the first to argue for the equal role of women in human evolution. On its first publication in 1972 it sparked an international debate and became a rallying-point for feminism, changing the terminology of anthropologists forever. Starting with her demolition of the Biblical myth that woman was an afterthought to the creation of man, Elaine Morgan rewrites human history and evolution.This lively, informative book sets out to solve the riddle of our origins; its answer is controversial. Elaine Morgan has made The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and The Descent of Woman first set out an understanding of who humans are and where they came from.Elaine Morgan was best known as a writer for television until the publication of The Descent of Woman in 1972, which became an international bestseller. She then spent ten years researching human evolution before publishing The Aquatic Ape (published by Souvenir Press as a revised edition, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis) in 1982. In the years since, The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis has gone on to win widespread support among scientists.It is a measure of Elaine Morgan's enduring importance, provocative thought and international reputation that in January 2006, the first Chinese translation of The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis became a Number 1 bestseller in Taiwan.",0285627007,9780285627000),Paperback,,288 pages,"

","More than any of their contemporaries, Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron are challenging the boundaries between architecture and art. Natural History explores that challenge, examining how the work of this formidable pair has drawn upon the art of both past and present, and brought architecture into dialogue with the art of our time. Echoing an encyclopedia, this publication reflects the natural history museum structure of the exhibition which it accompanies, organized by the Canadian Centre for Architecture. Models and projects by Herzog & de Meuron, as well as by other artists, are structured around six thematic portfolios that suggest an evolutionary history of the architects' work: Appropriation & Reconstruction, Transformation & Alienation, Stacking & Compression, Imprints & Moulds, Interlocking Spaces, and Beauty & Atmosphere. Each section is introduced with a statement from Herzog, and more than 20 artists, scholars, and architects have contributed essays, including Carrie Asman, Georges Didi-Huberman, Kurt W. Forster, Boris Groys, Ulrike Meyer Stump, Peggy Phelan, Thomas Ruff, Rebecca Schneider, Adolf Max Vogt, and Jeff Wall.",3907078853,9783907078853),Hardcover,,,"

Her father a champion trainer, she shared her life with more than 100 thoroughbred racehorses, mares, foals and ponies, as well as an ever-present pack of boxers and lurchers. As a toddler she would happily ride the legendary Mill Reef and take breakfast with the Queen.She and her younger brother came very low down the pecking order. Left to their own devices, they had to learn life's toughest lessons through the animals, and through their adventures in the stables and the idyllic Hampshire Downs. From the protective Candy to the pot-bellied Valkyrie and the frisky Hattie, each horse and each dog had their own character and their own special part to play.The running family joke was that ""women ain't people"". Clare had to prove them wrong, to make her voice heard - but first she had to make sure she had something to say.My Animals and Other Family is a funny, brave, tender story of self- discovery.",English,English,Hardcover,,258 pages,"

","The first trade paperback edition of the New York Times best-seller about West Point's Class of 1966, by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Atkinson.This is the story of the twenty-five-year adventure of the generation of officers who fought in Vietnam. With novelistic detail, Atkinson tells the story of West Point's Class of 1966 primarily through the experiences of three classmates and the women they loved--from the boisterous cadet years and youthful romances to the fires of Vietnam, where dozens of their classmates died and hundreds more grew disillusioned, to the hard peace and family adjustments that followed. The rich cast of characters includes Douglas MacArthur, William Westmoreland, and a score of other memorable figures. The West Point Class of 1966 straddled a fault line in American history, and Rick Atkinson's masterly book speaks for a generation of American men and women about innocence, patriotism, and the price we pay for our dreams.",0805062912,9780805062915),Paperback,,608 pages,"

","About the Book :Immortals of Meluha :1900 BC. In what modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha – a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived.This once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis. To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills.The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend: ‘When evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge.’Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero? And does he want to be that hero at all? Drawn suddenly to his destiny, by duty as well as by love, will Shiva lead the Suryavanshi vengeance and destroy evil?This is the first book in a trilogy on Shiva, the simple man whose karma re-cast him as our Mahadev, the God of Gods.The Secret of the Nagas :Today, He is a God.4000 years ago, He was just a man.The hunt is on. The sinister Naga warrior has killed his friend Brahaspati and now stalks his wife Sati. Shiva, the Tibetan immigrant who is the prophesied destroyer of evil, will not rest till he finds his demonic adversary. His vengeance and the path to evil will lead him to the door of the Nagas, the serpent people. Of that he is certain. The evidence of the malevolent rise of evil is everywhere. A kingdom is dying as it is held to ransom for a miracle drug. A crown prince is murdered. The Vasudevs – Shiva’s philosopher guides – betray his unquestioning faith as they take the aid of the dark side. Even the perfect empire, Meluha is riddled with a terrible secret in Maika, the city of births. Unknown to Shiva, a master puppeteer is playing a grand game. In a journey that will take him across the length and breadth of ancient India, Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems.Fierce battles will be fought. Surprising alliances will be forged. Unbelievable secrets will be revealed in this second book of the Shiva Trilogy, the sequel to the #1 national bestseller, The Immortals of Meluha.The Oath of the Vayuputras - Shiva Trilogy 3 :The Oath of Vayuputras is the eagerly awaited third and final part of the Shiva Trilogy by Amish. Shiva, as portrayed in the previous books of the series, is a mortal Tibetan Tribal Chief who becomes the savior of the people of Meluha and joins hands with the Nagas. In this part, Shiva realizes that Nagas are not his enemies and determines to unveil the root of all evil and his true enemy.In this final part of the Shiva Trilogy, Shiva reaches to Panchvati, the capital of the Nagas and comes face to face with Evil, a name which instills fear in the hearts of the fiercest of warriors. Shiva who is also known as Neelkanth by now, prepares for a holy war against his true enemy. Come what may, Shiva must not fail now. A series of brutal battles begins and it convulses India. In desperation to win over Evil, Shiva reaches out to the Vayuputras, who have never offered any help to him previously. He meets the chiefs of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha.Shiva also comes to know the reality about many characters that he thinks are close to him and many new characters have been introduced too in this part by the writer. Many people die in the battles but will Shiva succeed in overthrowing Evil? If so, at what cost to himself and to India? Will he finally emerge as a God from a normal mortal existence? This final part of the trilogy reveals the last and the vigorous journey that Shiva undertakes in order to destroy the evil.",English,English,Paperback,,1426 pages,"

Devorah Manikian had been rehearsing for a starring role in Carmen and was living in Eggerscliffe, a 1920s-style pseudo-castle belonging to wealthy and eccentric impresario, Annajean Eggers. Devorah was gone only a few weeks before Lee was notified that she was dead—killed in a tower fire at Eggerscliffe. But as Lee stands alone on a deserted patch of beach just below the castle, she hears Devorah singing. Is it the cocktail of tranquilizers, sleeping pills, anti-depressants, and anti-anxiety drugs Lee has been taking since the announcement of Devorah’s death that makes her hallucinate her beloved’s voice—or is Devorah being kept a prisoner somewhere in Eggerscliffe?",English,English,Paperback,,264 pages,"

Gabriella knew it was all too good to be true. The way his touch radiated electricity right to her core, the way his ice blue eyes somehow made panties drop involuntarily, how his sexy half-smile crumbled the barriers around her heart…Dorian was extraordinary in every way. She ignored the alarm bells for the sake of pleasure and a little slice of peace from her mixed-up life. She thought that whatever he was, she could help him. Maybe even change him. But now that the proof of Dorian’s true identity and what he was sent for is staring her in the face, Gabriella can’t deny the inevitable. And confronting that truth could very well slaughter more than just her fragile heart.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,445 pages,"

","Thomas Cromwell era il figlio di un fabbro di Putney. Un uomo capace di redigere un contratto e addestrare un falco, di disegnare una mappa e sedare una rissa, di arredare una casa e corrompere una giuria. Architetto machiavellico del regno di Enrico Vili e artefice dei destini della dinastia dei Tudor, il protagonista del pluripremiato romanzo di Hilary Mantel emerge qui in tutta la sua contraddittoria umanità. Cromwell venuto dal nulla, dedito ai mestieri più disparati - mercenario in Francia, banchiere a Firenze, commerciante di tessuti ad Anversa - in virtù delle sole doti intellettuali; Cromwell, di cui il re si servirà per ottenere il divorzio da Caterina d'Aragona e sposare Anna Bolena, dando così un nuovo corso alla storia della Chiesa inglese. Hilary Mantel ci dà un ritratto dell'Inghilterra dei Tudor nel quale il fascino di un'epoca lontana conosce uno splendore rinnovato, che pur senza tradire la cronaca degli eventi nulla ha in comune con la polverosa distanza di una remota pagina di storia: perché in Wolf Hall riusciamo a sentire l'odore acre della lana impregnata dalla pioggia e della terra sotto i piedi, il rilievo delle ossa sotto la pelle, il solco lasciato dai carri nel fango, il fruscio dei topi nei materassi. La pregnanza della scrittura di un'autrice già celeberrima in patria, che dà ora voce e sostanza al suo capolavoro, dilaga in una decodifica, ironica e precisa, della corte inglese: fino a mostrarne l'ossatura segreta, a ribaltarne le prospettive e il canone.",9788864114057,9788864114057,ebook,Prima edizione digitale,779 pages,"

","Erich Auerbach's Mimesis still stands as a monumental achievement in literary criticism. A brilliant display of erudition, wit, and wisdom, his exploration of how great European writers from Homer to Virginia Woolf depicted reality has taught generations how to read Western literature.""There is no other work in contemporary literary criticism known to me that is comparable in scope, in analytical and historical richness; it is actually a history of European literature from the Odyssey to Ulysses and shows a quiet mastery of all the literatures of the West. I can never pick up this book without learning from it and without marveling at the penetration with which Auerbach's handling of his subject—the different forms by which the great European writers have shaped their ideas of reality—lead him to a new understanding of all postclassical literature."" -- Alfred Kazin, American Scholar",0691012695,0691012695,Paperback,1st paper,576 pages,"

But it's not long before Tony and DCI Carol Jordan realise it's just the start of a brutal and ruthless campaign targeting an apparently unconnected group of young people. Their chameleon-like killer is chatting with them online, pretending to share their interests and beliefs - and then luring them to their deaths.But just when Tony should be at the heart of the hunt, he's pushed to the margins by Carol's cost-cutting boss and replaced by a dangerously inexperienced profiler. Struggling with the newly awakened ghosts of his own past and desperate for distraction in his work, Tony battles to find the answers that will give him personal and professional satisfaction in his most nerve-shattering investigation yet.Psychologically gripping and relentlessly paced, 'Fever of the Bone' is the perfect introduction for those who have not yet discovered the damaged but brilliant criminal profiler Tony Hill and DCI Carol Jordan, best known from ITV's award-winning 'Wire in the Blood'.",1408701987,9781408701980),Hardcover,,432 pages,"

Old rivals from the past and bad blood from the present have mixed in the worst way, threatening to take away the things Viviana loves the very most. No matter what, she can’t let that happen. Both Viviana and Anton know there’s only one way this can all end and it’s up to them to do it. But, who is behind the veiled threats and personal attacks, and how far are they willing to go to get what they want? When the truth finally surfaces, the consequences will be devastating and no one could have seen it coming.

","Sometimes, the hardest part of becoming a success is keeping a straight face...Jamie & Laura Newman have recently become quite the successful - and mildly wealthy - couple, thanks to the fact they've managed to write a series of popular romantic comedies together. This has come as a complete surprise to the hapless pair, and is - needless to say - a turn of events neither is in the slightest bit equipped to deal with.They get invited to posh events where they feel endlessly out of place, have long lost relatives turn up out of the blue, raise an aspiring diva for a daughter, and go on holiday to exotic places they really have no place being. It's enough to make anyone crawl under the nearest rock.If you're Jamie, you also get to turn 40 - and there's not a damn thing he can do to stop it. As for Laura, well let's say that just because you can afford to purchase expensive beauty products, it doesn't necessarily mean that you should.‘Money can't buy you happiness’ as the old saying goes. Nor can it stop the Newmans being the Newmans, with all their quirks, eccentricities - and the uncanny ability to embarrass themselves in public at the drop of a hat.LOVE... AMONG THE STARS is the fourth book by Nick Spalding about Jamie & Laura, and is full of the warts-and-all, laugh out loud comedy you've come to know and love.***Reviews for Nick Spalding & Love...

","O Livro 3 revela o estilo forte e truculento de uma personagem única, Ushikawa de seu nome. A par de Tengo e Aomame, a voz da Ushikawa ecoa nas páginas do terceiro volume de 1Q84 e provoca as reações mais intensas. Amem-no ou detestem-no, mas deixem-no entregue à sua sorte. Tengo e Aomame continuam sem saber, mas aquele é o único lugar perfeito no mundo. Um lugar perfeitamente isolado e, ao mesmo tempo, o único que escapa às malhas da solidão. Este mundo também deverá ter as suas ameaças, os seus perigos, claro, e estar cheio dos seus próprios enigmas e de contradições. Mas não faz mal. A páginas tantas, é preciso acreditar. Sob as duas luas de 1Q84, Aomame e Tengo deixam de estar sozinhos... Inspirado em parte no romance 1984, de George Orwell, 1Q84 é uma surpreendente obra de ficção, escrita de forma poderosa e imaginativa - a um tempo um thriller e uma tocante história de amor. Murakami continua a provocar o espanto e a emoção, comunicando com milhões de pessoas de todas as idades, espalhadas pelo mundo inteiro.

Preferring chaos to bullying, Del makes it her mission to save her dad's crumbling café, the Flywheel, while he 'finds himself' overseas. Accompanied by her charming troublemaker best friend Charlie, Del sets out to save the cafe, keep Charlie out of prison, and maybe get a date with Rosa, the beautiful flamenco dancer from across the road. But when life is messy enough as it is, can girl-on-girl romance ever have a happy ending? This hilarious and accident-prone novel is about how to be heartbroken and how to fall in love; about rising above high-school drama and wrestling with problems that are (almost) too big. It speaks directly to teens and assures them that they’re not alone, and does it all with an abundance of heart.",English,English,Paperback,,309 pages,"

","Meet the Cooke family. Our narrator is Rosemary Cooke. As a child, she never stopped talking; now that she's started college, she has wrapped herself in silence: the silence of intentional forgetting, of protective cover. Rosemary is now an only child, but she used to have a sister the same age as her, and an older brother. Both are now gone—vanished from her life. Her once lively mother is a shell of her former self, her clever and imperious father now a distant, brooding man. And there was something unique about Rosemary's sister, Fern.You'll have to find out for yourself what it is that makes her unhappy family unlike any other.",0142180823,9780142180822),Paperback,,320 pages,"

","This is the absorbing story of Neil deGrasse Tyson’s lifelong fascination with the night sky, a restless wonder that began some thirty years ago on the roof of his Bronx apartment building and eventually led him to become the director of the Hayden Planetarium. A unique chronicle of a young man who at one time was both nerd and jock, Tyson’s memoir could well inspire other similarly curious youngsters to pursue their dreams.Like many athletic kids he played baseball, won medals in track and swimming, and was captain of his high school wrestling team. But at the same time he was setting up a telescope on winter nights, taking an advanced astronomy course at the Hayden Planetarium, and spending a summer vacation at an astronomy camp in the Mojave Desert.Eventually, his scientific curiosity prevailed, and he went on to graduate in physics from Harvard and to earn a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Columbia. There followed postdoctoral research at Princeton. In 1996, he became the director of the Hayden Planetarium, where some twenty-five years earlier he had been awed by the spectacular vista in the sky theater.Tyson pays tribute to the key teachers and mentors who recognized his precocious interests and abilities, and helped him succeed. He intersperses personal reminiscences with thoughts on scientific literacy, careful science vs. media hype, the possibility that a meteor could someday hit the Earth, dealing with society’s racial stereotypes, what science can and cannot say about the existence of God, and many other interesting insights about science, society, and the nature of the universe.Now available in paperback with a new preface and other additions, this engaging memoir will enlighten and inspire an appreciation of astronomy and the wonders of our universe.",159102188X,9781591021889),Paperback,,203 pages,"

","A la fin d’une chasse, pendant la curée, les chiens dévorent les entrailles de la bête tuée. Pour le jeune Zola, qui déteste son époque, c’est le cœur de Paris, entaillé par les larges avenues de Napoléon III, que des spéculateurs véreux s’arrachent. Ce deuxième volume des Rougon-Macquart, histoire naturelle et sociale d’une famille sous le Second Empire, est l’un des plus violents. Zola ne pardonne pas ces fortunes rapides qui inondent les allées du Bois d’attelages élégants, de toilettes de Worms et de bijoux éclatants. Aristide Saccard a réussi. Mais tout s’est dénaturé autour de lui : son épouse, Renée, la femme qui se conduit en homme, si belle et désœuvrée ; son fils, Maxime, l’amant efféminé de sa belle-mère. On accusa Zola d’obscénité. Il répliqua : « Une société n’est forte que lorsqu’elle met la vérité sous la grande lumière du soleil. »",2253003662,9782253003663),Paperback,,412 pages,"

","In the vein of Prozac Nation and Girl, Interrupted, an electrifying memoir about a young woman's promiscuous and self-destructive spiral after being cast out of her ultra-Orthodox Jewish family Leah Vincent was born into the Yeshivish community, a fundamentalist sect of ultra-Orthodox Judaism. As the daughter of an influential rabbi, Leah and her ten siblings were raised to worship two things: God and the men who ruled their world. But the tradition-bound future Leah envisioned for herself was cut short when, at sixteen, she was caught exchanging letters with a male friend, a violation of religious law that forbids contact between members of the opposite sex. Leah's parents were unforgiving. Afraid, in part, that her behavior would affect the marriage prospects of their other children, they put her on a plane and cut off ties. Cast out in New York City, without a father or husband tethering her to the Orthodox community, Leah was unprepared to navigate the freedoms of secular life. She spent the next few years using her sexuality as a way of attracting the male approval she had been conditioned to seek out as a child, while becoming increasingly unfaithful to the religious dogma of her past. Fast-paced, mesmerizing, and brutally honest, Cut Me Loose tells the story of one woman's harrowing struggle to define herself as an individual. Through Leah's eyes, we confront not only the oppressive world of religious fundamentalism, but also the broader issues that face even the most secular young women as they grapple with sexuality and identity.",English,English,Hardcover,,228 pages,"

","The Worldly Philosophers not only enables us to see more deeply into our history but helps us better understand our own times. In this seventh edition, Robert L. Heilbroner provides a new theme that connects thinkers as diverse as Adam Smith and Karl Marx. The theme is the common focus of their highly varied ideas—namely, the search to understand how a capitalist society works. It is a focus never more needed than in this age of confusing economic headlines.In a bold new concluding chapter entitled “The End of the Worldly Philosophy?” Heilbroner reminds us that the word “end” refers to both the purpose and limits of economics. This chapter conveys a concern that today’s increasingly “scientific” economics may overlook fundamental social and political issues that are central to economics. Thus, unlike its predecessors, this new edition provides not just an indispensable illumination of our past but a call to action for our future.

","To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, she has endured a tumultuous year of temptation, loss and strife to reach the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fate of two tribes hangs. Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life - first discovered in TWILIGHT, then scattered and torn in NEW MOON and ECLIPSE - seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed...forever?",1905654286,9781905654284),Hardcover,,768 pages,"

But nothing could have prepared them for this: Pitch has disappeared and taken Katherine with him. And now the Guardians are not only down one member, but a young girl is missing.Fortunately, MiM knows just the man to join the team.

","In 1855, a small volume appeared, self-published by a failed Brooklyn journalist and carpenter: twelve untitled poems and a preface announcing the author's aims. A commercial failure, this book was the first stage of a massive, lifelong enterprise. Six editions and thirty-seven years later, Leaves of Grass had been recognized as one of the central masterworks of world poetry. This Library of America Paperback Classic includes two complete texts: the 1855 first edition and the magnificent culminating edition of 1891-1892. For almost thirty years, The Library of America has presented America's best and most significant writing in acclaimed hardcover editions. Now, a new series, Library of America Paperback Classics, offers attractive and affordable books that bring The Library of America's authoritative texts within easy reach of every reader. Each book features an introductory essay by one of a leading writer, as well as a detailed chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the choice and history of the text, and notes. The contents of this Paperback Classic are drawn from Walt Whitman: Poetry and Prose, edited by Justin Kaplan, volume #3 in the Library of America series.",1598530976,9781598530971),Paperback,,757 pages,"

","Taking its title from T.S. Eliot's modernist poem The Waste Land, Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust is a chronicle of Britain's decadence and social disintegration between the First and Second World Wars. This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Robert Murray Davis.After seven years of marriage, the beautiful Lady Brenda Last is bored with life at Hetton Abbey, the Gothic mansion that is the pride and joy of her husband, Tony. She drifts into an affair with the shallow socialite John Beaver and forsakes Tony for the Belgravia set. Brilliantly combining tragedy, comedy and savage irony, A Handful of Dust captures the irresponsible mood of the 'crazy and sterile generation' between the wars. This breakdown of the Last marriage is a painful, comic re-working of Waugh's own divorce, and a symbol of the disintegration of society.If you enjouyed A Handful of Dust, you might like Waugh's Vile Bodies, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.'One of the twentieth century's most chilling and bitter novels; and one of its best'Nicholas Lezard, Guardian'One of the most distinguished novels of the century'Frank Kermode'This is a masterpiece of stylish satire, and is funny, too ... a marvellous book'John Banville, Irish Times",0141183969,9780141183961),Paperback,,255 pages,"

","Las Iluminaciones, de Jean-Arthur Rimbaud, fueron escritas entre 1873 y 1875. Se publicaron por primera vez en cinco entregas en el periódico de los simbolistas La Vogue, en 1886. No es posible pensar la poesía del siglo XX sin el aporte de este pequeño pero significativo libro, que junto con las Poesías y Una temporada en el infierno revolucionaría el modo de concebir la escritura e influiría decisivamente en las primeras vanguardias, especialmente en el surrealismo. La obra de Rimbaud, al igual que las de Lautréamont, Mallarmé, Jarry y Verlaine, implica un quiebre radical con el romanticismo y el realismo decimonónicos. A partir de ellos nace una nueva concepción de la literatura, cuyas consecuencias serán apreciadas más tarde con la crítica, con la reflexión de Barthes, Blanchot y Camus, entre otros escritores.",9505630093,9789505630097),Paperback,Edición Bilingue,103 pages,"

She is thrilled to have the opportunity to travel, lecture, and give cooking demonstrations on the very latest kitchen revolution--the gas stove--and certainly doesn't mind that the gas company has hired the handsome Lewis Mathis to perform at her lectures.

This is an account of the world's greatest ‘intellectual virtuosos,' who are also humanity's greatest doubters and disbelievers, from the ancient Greek philosophers, Jesus, and the Eastern religions, to modern secular equivalents Marx, Freud and Darwin—and their attempts to reconcile the seeming meaninglessness of the universe with the human need for meaning,This remarkable book ranges from the early Greeks, Hebrew figures such as Job and Ecclesiastes, Eastern critical wisdom, Roman stoicism, Jesus as a man of doubt, Gnosticism and Christian mystics, medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian skeptics, secularism, the rise of science, modern and contemporary critical thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, the existentialists.",0060097957,9780060097950),Paperback,,576 pages,"

","Alcohol was ""the gasoline of all adventure"" for Sarah Hepola. She spent her evenings at cocktail parties and dark bars where she proudly stayed till last call. Drinking felt like freedom, part of her birthright as a strong, enlightened twenty-first-century woman. But there was a price. She often blacked out, waking up with a blank space where four hours should have been. Mornings became detective work on her own life. What did I say last night? How did I meet that guy? She apologized for things she couldn't remember doing, as though she were cleaning up after an evil twin. Publicly, she covered her shame with self-deprecating jokes, and her career flourished, but as the blackouts accumulated, she could no longer avoid a sinking truth. The fuel she thought she needed was draining her spirit instead.A memoir of unblinking honesty and poignant, laugh-out-loud humor, Blackout is the story of a woman stumbling into a new kind of adventure--the sober life she never wanted.

","Nova edição do clássico de Machado de Assis com o apuro editorial da coleção Penguin-CompanhiaEm 1881, Machado de Assis lançou aquele que seria um divisor de águas não só em sua obra, mas na literatura brasileira: Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas. Ao mesmo tempo em que marca a fase mais madura do autor, o livro é considerado a transição do romantismo para o realismo. Num primeiro momento, a prosa fragmentária e livre de Memórias póstumas, misturando elegância e abuso, refinamento e humor negro, causou estranheza, inclusive entre a crítica. Com o tempo, no entanto, o defunto autor que dedica sua obra ao verme que primeiro roeu as frias carnes de seu cadáver tornou-se um dos personagens mais populares da nossa literatura. Sua história, uma celebração do nada que foi sua vida, foi transformada em filmes, peças e HQs, e teve incontáveis edições no Brasil e no mundo, conquistando admiradores que vão de Susan Sontag a Woody Allen. Esta edição reproduz o prólogo do próprio autor à terceira edição do livro, em que ele responde às dúvidas dos primeiros leitores. Traz ainda prefácio e notas de Marta de Senna, cocriadora e editora da revista eletrônica Machado de Assis em Linha, e Marcelo Diego, pesquisador da obra de Machado na Universidade Princeton.",8582850018,9788582850015),Paperback,,368 pages,"

","Questo libro non è l'autobiografia di Giovanni Allevi che, musicista e filosofo timido, non avrebbe mai pensato di scriverne una. La sua storia però, che lo ha portato dal pianoforte scordato di una scuola di provincia al fedele Bösendorfer con cui oggi registra i suoi successi, è davvero eccezionale. Ma è solo il filo conduttore di queste pagine che sono un doveroso omaggio, una dichiarazione d'amore alla ""strega capricciosa"" che ha monopolizzato la sua vita: la musica, che ha sempre preteso da lui dedizione assoluta. Da quando si sono incontrati ha plasmato il suo pensiero, ha assorbito ogni energia. Per la musica, Allevi ha lavorato come cameriere, come supplente, ha distribuito volantini sui Navigli milanesi. Per lei è volato a New York a conquistarsi una possibilità nel tempio mondiale del jazz. E anche adesso che sono arrivati i dischi di platino, il tutto esaurito dagli Stati Uniti fino alla Cina, le collaborazioni con orchestre internazionali, la musica non gli dà pace e bussa nella sua testa per liberare, attraverso le sue mani, la propria voce. Perché Giovanni Allevi ringrazia questa entità tiranna, che una volta lo ha persino portato a guardare il mondo attraverso il vetro di un'ambulanza? Perché grazie a lei ha potuto esprimere emozioni e sentimenti oltre la barriera della parola. In questo libro racconta il pensiero e l'intenzione che animano la sua musica, in un libro che intreccia vita e filosofia e vibra della freschezza di uno sguardo che non vuole smettere di stupirsi.",8817022039,9788817022033),Paperback,,219 pages,"

","A tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave the author the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an ""excitement addict."" Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever. Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home. What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms. For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story.",1442339705,9781442339705),Audio CD,Unabridged,11 pages,"

","Londonistan to debiut, który stał się sensacją Targów Książki we Frankfurcie w 2005 roku. W Wielkiej Brytanii powieść ukazała się wiosną 2006 roku i błyskawicznie stała się bestsellerem. Prawa do przekładu nabyły wydawnictwa z kilkunastu krajów. Mieszkający w Londynie, dziewiętnastoletni Jas, bohater powieści i jednocześnie jej narrator, przyłącza się do gangu rówieśników - Hadrjita, Raviego i Amita - którzy przemoc uważają za manifestację odrębności. Najbrutalniejszy jest sikh Hardjit, konfliktowy przywódca grupy. Pogardza tymi, którzy upodabniają się do białych. Nazywa ich kokosiakami, bo zupełnie tak jak orzech kokosowy na zewnątrz są brązowi, wewnątrz zaś biali. Ravi i Amit to Hindusi. Pierwszy jest całkowicie podporządkowany grupie, drugi – poza życiem gangu – ma na głowie rodzinne niesnaski związane ze ślubem brata. Jas, ostatni z całej czwórki, do niedawna sam jeszcze zaliczał się do kokosiaków. Teraz pragnie zerwać ze swą ""niechlubną"" przeszłością, zapomnieć, czego nauczył się w angielskiej szkole. Na przeszkodzie stanie jednak wiele rzeczy. Przede wszystkim miłość do muzułmanki Samiry, która z pewnością nie zostałaby zaakceptowana przez kolegów. Po publikacji Londonistanu Malkani został okrzyknięty pisarzem posiadającym bezbłędny słuch literacki. Szokujące lingwistyczne eksperymenty i realistyczny sposób ukazania życia ulicznego gangu może przywodzić na myśl Mechaniczną pomarańczę. Malkani jednak, w przeciwieństwie do Anthony'ego Burgessa, nie tworzy sztucznego języka, lecz potrafi doskonale przekładać młodzieżowy slang, mowę ulicy oraz hiphopowe teksty na znakomitą literaturę.",8374142057,9788374142052),Hardcover,,431 pages,"

","È il maggio del 1816 e a Londra i ministri degli Esteri britannico e francese stanno per firmare un accordo che segnerà inesorabilmente le sorti di una parte del mondo cruciale dal punto di vista politico ed economico: il Medio Oriente. L’Impero Ottomano infatti ha i giorni contati e la sua caduta sta per lasciare un vuoto di potere dall’Egitto all’Iraq al Libano alla Palestina. Inglesi e francesi si spartiscono le future zone di influenza in un patto segreto tra le loro diplomazie, noto alla storia come «trattato Sykes-Picot».Ma, chiede Jean-François Levent, un giovane diplomatico francese presente alla firma degli accordi, e gli arabi? «Gli arabi non esistono, sono solo un miserabile aggregato di tribù, piccole fazioni gelose le une delle altre e incapaci di coesione », è la sprezzante risposta del ministro inglese. Parole che provocherebbero incredulità e indignazione se le udisse Hussein Shahid, produttore di agrumi in Palestina, o Farid Lufti, coltivatore di cotone al Cairo, o Nidal El-Safi, colto patriarca di un’influente famiglia di Baghdad. Queste tre famiglie arabe, così come i Tarbush di Haifa, o come la famiglia ebrea dei Marcus, fuggita dai pogrom della Polonia per stabilirsi in Palestina, conducono la loro esistenza in una maniera ben diversa da quella immaginata dai ministri occidentali. Seguono rispettosamente tradizioni millenarie, ma allo stesso tempo sono culturalmente aperte, capaci di convivere in sintonia e amicizia con arabi di diverse origini e con gli ebrei.Tuttavia, mentre i pazienti e colti patriarchi non si capacitano che le potenze occidentali possano sul serio intervenire in maniera tanto profonda e inconsapevole nella loro terra, i loro figli già inneggiano a rivolte contro i traditori e invasori, i quali addirittura si dice abbiano avvallato l’apertura agli ebrei di un numeroso e indipendente insediamento in Palestina.Murad Shahid figlio di Hussein, Taymur Lufti, giovane egiziano, Shams e Dunia El-Safi, fratelli iracheni, continuano a vivere la loro vita fatta di istruzione e lavoro, nuovi sentimenti, trascurabili incomprensioni con i propri padri e piccole ribellioni contro inglesi e francesi, ma negli animi loro e dei loro coetanei si insinuano ferite inguaribili che porteranno alla nascita di nazionalismi locali e del fondamentalismo arabo, con odi violenti tra popolazioni che da secoli vivevano in armonia sotto un lontano giogo.Prima opera di una serie dedicata al Medio Oriente, La terra dei gelsomini mostra lo straordinario talento di Gilbert Sinoué nel restituirci in forma romanzata le trasformazioni avvenute nel Ventesimo secolo in quel lembo di terra e le responsabilità delle incomprensioni, dei tradimenti, dei massacri tra le popolazioni locali e nei confronti dell’Occidente",2081219107,9782081219106),Paperback,,,"

Fallen from the height of power and influence and left for dead in a foreign place, Aaron has lost everything, and now he must humbly beg for food from those who saved his life.In Artimé, Alex chooses his people over his brother and abandons his search for Aaron, closing the door on that relationship forever. The Artimeans need his focus now more than ever as they face the terrifying power of a new enemy who has taken control of Quill—the notoriously evil Gondoleery Rattrapp.Desperate to stop her, Alex embarks on a risky mission to enlist help from an unlikely ally, and along the way he’s determined to rescue a lone sailor from monstrous beasts with mysterious origins—a sailor who just might show Alex a different world. As he prepares for an epic war with all of Quill and Artime hanging in the balance, Alex must place his faith in a reckless plan...and hope that he and all of his friends make it through alive.",1442493364,9781442493360),ebook,,528 pages,"

","Also available in Legends IIBONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Terry Brooks's The Measure of the Magic.The time of the Shannara follows in the wake of an apocalypse that has destroyed the old world and very nearly annihilated its people as well. A thousand years of savagery and barbarism have concluded at the start the series with the emergence of a new civilization in which magic has replaced science as the dominant source of power. A Druid Council comprised of the most talented of the new races–Men, Dwarves, Trolls, Gnomes, and Elves, names taken from the old legends–has begun the arduous task of rebuilding the world and putting an end to the racial warfare that has consumed the survivors of the so-called Great Wars since their conclusion.But the wars continue, albeit in a different form. Magic, like science, is often mercurial, can be used for good or evil, and can have a positive or negative effect on those who come in contact with it. In The Sword of Shannara, a Druid subverted by his craving for magic’ s power manipulated Trolls and Gnomes in his effort to gain mastery over the other races. He failed because of Shea Ohmsford, the last of an Elven family with the Shannara surname. Shea, with the help of his brother and a small band of companions, was able to wield the fabled Sword of Shannara to destroy the Dark Lord. Subsequently, in the Elfstones of the Shannara, his grandson Wil was faced with another sort of challenge, one that required the use of a magic contained in a set of Elfstones. But use of the Stones altered Wil’s genetic makeup, so that his own children were born with magic in their blood. As a result, in the third book of the series, the Wishsong of Shannara, Brin and her brother Jair were recruited by the Druid Allanon to seek out and destroy the Ildatch, the book of dark magic that had subverted the Warlock Lord, and was now doing the same with the Mord wraiths.The story that follows takes place several years after the conclusion of The Wishsong and again features Jair Ohmsford, who must come to terms with his obsession with the past and his use of his magic that his sister has warned him not to trust...Indomitable by Terry Brooks, appearing soon in the Legends II anthology. TERRY BROOKS adds an exciting epilogue to The Wishsong of Shannara in “Indomitable,” the tale of Jair Ohmsford’s desperate quest to complete the destruction of the evil Ildatch . . . armed only with the magic of illusion.",0345471105,9780345471109),ebook,,96 pages,"

","When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.",0060745908,9780060745905),Paperback,Musical Tie-in Edition,409 pages,"

Malise Ruthven presents a full overview of the religion in its historical, geographic, and social settings.  For this revised and long-awaited second edition, Ruthven divides his original chapters into more accessible sub-sections and provides new headings. Also included is a new concluding chapter that focuses on women in Islam, the challenges Islam faces in today's climate of globalization, and the key developments in Islamic political history since 1984--an especially fertile period that has seen, among other things, the Taliban movement in Afghanistan and the controversial publication of Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Islam and the World, Second Edition likewise features a new preface, redrawn maps, updated data on population and dispersal, and a new chronology of events with genealogical charts.",0195138414,9780195138412),Paperback,,472 pages,"

Филолог, специалист по древнерусской литературе, он не любит исторических романов, их навязчивого этнографизма - кокошников, повойников, портов, зипунов и прочую унылую стилизацию. Используя интонации древнерусских текстов, Водолазкин причудливо смешивает разные эпохи и языковые стихии, даря читателю не гербарий, но живой букет. Герой нового романа Лавр - средневековый врач. Обладая даром исцеления, он тем не менее не может спасти свою возлюбленную и принимает решение пройти земной путь вместо нее. Так жизнь превращается в житие. Он выхаживает чумных и раненых, убогих и немощных, и чем больше жертвует собой, тем очевиднее крепнет его дар. Но возможно ли любовью и жертвой спасти душу человека, не сумев уберечь ее земной оболочки. ""Есть то, о чем легче говорить в древнерусском контексте. Например, о Боге.

","A fully illustrated guide to the world-famous comic character Tintin, and his adventures. This well-researched and gorgeously presented overview follows Tintin through the 23 titles of the complete series. Tintin is the classic example of groundbreaking graphic narrative that all others can be compared to. Written and drawn between 1929 and 1976, the 23 adventures of Tintin, his dog Snowy and an unforgettable cast of characters has become a defining standard of graphic literature. The Complete Companion contextualizes the work of Tintin's creator, Herge, and places it in its historical context. Author Michael Farr shows Herge's drawings side by side with their references, demonstrating how he established believable backgrounds and realistic details. The Companion includes a large number of sketches, which Herge would re-work and polish until he found the clearest, most easily readable line-giving birth to a style that would later be called Clear Line.The Adventures of Tintin mix universal appeal, adventure and slapstick, drama and humor in a collection of stories that have stood the test of time and whose art style has been adopted by new generations of European cartoonists. This is the ultimate companion to the Adventures of Tintin.Book Details:

","“Don’t you know? Animals like you have no soul.”   Could God ever love a half-blood all of society looks upon with such fear and disdain? Jace once believed so, but when a tragic loss shatters the only peace he’s ever known, his faith crumbles as the nagging doubts he’s tried to put behind him descend on his grieving heart. With them come the haunting memories of the bloodstained past he longs to forget, but can never escape.   Taken from home at a young age and raised to serve the emperor, Kyrin Altair lives every day under a dangerous pretense of loyalty. After her unique observation skills and perfect memory place her into direct service to the emperor, Kyrin finds herself in further jeopardy as it becomes increasingly difficult to hide her belief in Elôm, the one true God.  Following the emperor’s declaration to enforce the worship of false gods under the penalty of death, many lives are endangered. But there are those willing to risk everything to take a stand and offer aid to the persecuted. With their lives traveling paths they never could have imagined, Jace and Kyrin must fight to overcome their own fears and conflicts with society as they become part of the resistance.

","Cameron Bates (Cam) could have almost any girl at Franklin High School…except for the one he wants. Unfortunately Bebe seems to be immune to his flirty charm and good looks, which means one of two things: a) she’s completely oblivious to how he feels, or b) she’s just not into him. If that’s the case, declaring his love would be disastrous for their friendship.  Bianca Barnes (Bebe) has a huge problem: the universe hates her. Every time she admits feelings for a boy, he ends up falling for her sweet, popular, and beautiful sister Beth. To avoid a broken heart, Bebe has sworn herself to secrecy. Nobody can know how she feels about Cam…Ever!  Neither person wants to confess their feelings, but the universe has its own plan. Out of the blue, Bebe is courted by a secret admirer. Cam has to step up his game and Bebe has to make a choice. Play it safe and accept the affections of her mystery man or challenge fate and take a chance on the boy she loves.  Content Description: This is a stand-alone YA contemporary romance with companion novels to follow. It contains minor language, innuendo, crude humor and steamy tension but is generally very clean.

","Detta är den största retrospektiva boken över Sune Jonssons livsverk som någonsin har gjorts. Han räknas som en av Sveriges genom tiderna viktigaste dokumentärfotografer; de inträngande och stillsamma porträtten tar tag i var och en som ser dem. Hans bildvärld befolkas av människor som kan tyckas avlägsna, men de befinner sig bara några decennier bort. Bilderna är viktiga dokument men också tidlös poesi.Sune Jonsson (1930-2009) verkade under nästan hela sitt liv i Västerbottens län. Han tog som sin livsuppgift att dokumentera de jordbrukarliv som han såg försvinna då ett alltmer storskaligt och urbant samhälle ersatte det gamla odlingslandskapet.Monografin Livstycken spänner över större delen av Sune Jonssons verk, från debutboken Byn med det blå huset via Bilder från den stora flyttningen till Och tiden blir ett förunderligt ting. Texten är skriven av Val Williams, Professor of the History and Culture of Photography vid University of the Arts London och tidigare curator vid Hasselblad Center. Sune Jonssons egna texter ger ingångar till hans olika projekt.Boken, som även utkommer på engelska med titeln Life and Work, görs i samarbete med Sune Jonsson Centrum för dokumentärfotografi vid Västerbottens museum.",9789171262431,9789171262431,Hardcover,,,"

","« L'uomo che ha accettato una volta per sempre la terribile presenza del divino nella sua povera vita », cosi Bernanos definisce il protagonista del suo Diario di un curato di campagna: questa disarmata figura di prete cattolico che si consuma fino al limite della tentazione nell'impari lotta con il male impersonato dalla tragica opacità del mondo borghese di uno sperduto villaggio della Fiandra. Egli non deve salvare soltanto se stesso ma anche le anime dei suoi parrocchiani che gli sono ostili, o lo accettano passivamente trascinandolo nelle loro ipocrisie. Giunge fin quasi al punto di abiurare, ma proprio sull'orlo della perdizione la coscienza della morte vicina lo salva. « Un corpo a corpo fra il soprannaturale e il mondo; ma il mondo non è mai stato sentito da Bernanos con una comprensione più potente e più tenera », cosi scrisse André Rousseaux del Diario di un curato di campagna, un romanzo che ha in sé fin dalle prime pagine una carica drammatica che si va facendo via via sempre più febbrile e compressa ed esplode poi, ad un tratto, in tutta la sua pienezza dinnanzi all'illuminazione.",8804315636,9788804315636),Paperback,,244 pages,"

A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. Dear Ijeawele is Adichie's letter of response.Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions--compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive--for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can ""allow"" women to have full careers, Dear Ijeawele goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.",0008241031,9780008241032),Hardcover,,80 pages,"

","Science-fiction superstar and multiple Hugo and Nebula Award winner Nancy Kress comes to YA in this brain-twisting thrillerHow far would you go? The Collapse has ransacked the economy, making work almost impossible to find and forcing Amy from college hopeful to sole provider for her terminally-ill grandmother and rebellious younger sister. To make ends meet, Amy auditions for a slot on a new reality TV show, which promises both a hefty salary and full medical benefits for her entire family. Somehow, she gets chosen, and she leaps to sign a contract despite her misgivings.   The show in which she’ll take part has an irresistible premise: audience members can win millions by predicting the behavior of each member of the cast in a crisis. But the producers are willing to do anything to maintain ratings, including using blatant setups, 24/7 surveillance, and even state-of-the-art holographic technology to simulate danger. But soon, the danger becomes all too real, and Amy—on and off the camera—must fight for her life….",0142427462,9780142427460),Paperback,,512 pages,"

","BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Tess Gerritsen's The Silent Girl. Unknown bones, untold secrets, and unsolved crimes from the distant past cast ominous shadows on the present in the dazzling new thriller from New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen.  Present day: Julia Hamill has made a horrifying discovery on the grounds of her new home in rural Massachusetts: a skull buried in the rocky soil–human, female, and, according to the trained eye of Boston medical examiner Maura Isles, scarred with the unmistakable marks of murder. But whoever this nameless woman was, and whatever befell her, is knowledge lost to another time. . . .   Boston, 1830: In order to pay for his education, Norris Marshall, a talented but penniless student at Boston Medical College, has joined the ranks of local “resurrectionists”–those who plunder graveyards and harvest the dead for sale on the black market. Yet even this ghoulish commerce pales beside the shocking murder of a nurse found mutilated on the university hospital grounds. And when a distinguished doctor meets the same grisly fate, Norris finds that trafficking in the illicit cadaver trade has made him a prime suspect.   To prove his innocence, Norris must track down the only witness to have glimpsed the killer: Rose Connolly, a beautiful seamstress from the Boston slums who fears she may be the next victim. Joined by a sardonic, keenly intelligent young man named Oliver Wendell Holmes, Norris and Rose comb the city–from its grim cemeteries and autopsy suites to its glittering mansions and centers of Brahmin power–on the trail of a maniacal fiend who lurks where least expected . . . and who waits for his next lethal opportunity.   With unflagging suspense and pitch-perfect period detail, The Bone Garden deftly interweaves the thrilling narratives of its nineteenth- and twenty-first century protagonists, tracing the dark mystery at its heart across time and place to a finale as ingeniously conceived as it is shocking. Bold, bloody, and brilliant, this is Tess Gerritsen’s finest achievement to date.  ""An old mystery is crossed with a modern story in the latest from Gerritsen (The Mephisto Club, 2006, etc.).Julia Hamill, newly divorced and still smarting, purchases an old house outside Boston. Determined to dig a garden, she instead finds the bones of a long-dead woman–the apparent victim of murder–which starts her on a journey to ferret out the story behind her death. Julia connects with Henry, a no-nonsense 89-year-old with boxes of documents that once belonged to the now-deceased previous owner of Julia’s home. The two discover a mystery dating back to the 1830s. At the heart of it is a baby named Meggie, born to the beautiful but doomed Irish chambermaid, Aurnia. Married to a man who cares nothing for her, Aurnia lays dying in a maternity ward with her sister, Rose, at her side. Rose, a spirited 17-year-old, takes Meggie to protect her from Aurnia’s husband, but soon finds herself the target of a bizarre manhunt. Someone is after the child–and Rose, as well, because she witnessed a horrifying murder. The body count piles up as Rose struggles to remain free of those who would take Meggie from her. Meanwhile, a young medical student becomes the chief suspect of the West End Reaper killings when he stumbles onto another terrible homicide. Although he fights the prospect, eventually he and Rose join forces to solve the murders and protect the baby at the heart of the mysterious deaths. Readers with delicate stomachs may find Gerritsen’s graphic descriptions of corpse dissection hard to take, but the story, which digs up a dark Boston of times long past, entices readers to keep turning pages long after their bedtimes.""  - Kirkus Reviews (starred)",0345497600,9780345497604),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

","Scattered among poor, desolate farms, the clans of the Uplands possess gifts. Wondrous gifts: the ability—with a glance, a gesture, a word—to summon animals, bring forth fire, move the land. Fearsome gifts: They can twist a limb, chain a mind, inflict a wasting illness. The Uplanders live in constant fear that one family might unleash its gift against another. Two young people, friends since childhood, decide not to use their gifts. One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill. In this beautifully crafted story, Ursula K. Le Guin writes of the proud cruelty of power, of how hard it is to grow up, and of how much harder still it is to find, in the world's darkness, gifts of light.",0152051244,9780152051242),Paperback,Second Edition,286 pages,"

Libby drew the pictures, May wrote the tales, and their heroine, Princess X, slayed all the dragons and scaled all the mountains their imaginations could conjure. Once upon a few years later, Libby was in the car with her mom, driving across the Ballard Bridge on a rainy night. When the car went over the side, Libby passed away, and Princess X died with her. Once upon a now: May is sixteen and lonely, wandering the streets of Seattle, when she sees a sticker slapped in a corner window. Princess X? When May looks around, she sees the Princess everywhere: Stickers. Patches. Graffiti. There's an entire underground culture, focused around a webcomic at IAmPrincessX.com.

","Andrew George's ""masterly new translation"" (The Times) of the world's first truly great work of literatureMiraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world’s oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh’s adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, the Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind’s eternal struggle with the fear of death.The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George’s gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluent narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

","Les Contes de Perrault sont le résultat d'une censure assez nette de tous les éléments et des motifs qui, dans la version originale, pouvaient choquer ou simplement ne pas être compris par un public mondain. Mais Perrault ne se contente pas de retrancher ce que les contes pouvaient avoir de vulgaire; il transforme le récit et l'adapte à la société de son temps, ajoutant des glaces et des parquets au logis de Cendrillon, restituant l'action du Petit Poucet à l'époque de la grande famine de 1693. Parallèlement, il les teinte d'un humour spirituel, agrémente le récit de plaisanteries parfois piquantes, destinées à ne pas prendre le merveilleux des contes trop au sérieux, déclarant par exemple que l'ogresse de la Belle au bois dormant veut manger la petite Aurore à la sauce Robert, que le prince et sa belle ne dormirent pas beaucoup après leurs retrouvailles, ou encore que les bottes du Chat botté n'étaient pas très commodes pour marcher sur les tuiles des toits. Ce faisant, il adapte son style à l'idée qu'il veut donner des Contes de ma mère l'Oye, multipliant les archaïsmes et les tournures vieillies, utilisant le dialogue, le présent de narration ou le jeu des formulettes («Anne ma sœur Anne, ne vois-tu rien venir?»; «Ma mère-grand, comme vous avez de grands bras»), qui rappellent l'origine orale des contes et leur vivacité. Intégrant les éléments populaires du conte à une trame romanesque, multipliant les signes d'une pseudo-oralité, ainsi que ceux d'une fausse innocence, Perrault transforme le conte populaire, en réalisant un des chefs-d'œuvre de la littérature universelle, et sauve de l'oubli les huit récits traditionnels, aujourd'hui célébrissimes, qui composent son recueil.",1421206021,9781421206028),Paperback,,280 pages,"

","Roman in curs de ecranizare in regia lui Martin ScorseseO carte despre credinta si indoiala, Tacere descrie persecutiile la care erau supusi crestinii in Japonia secolului al XVII-lea, in timpul shogunatului Tokugawa. Trimis sa verifice zvonurile despre apostazia mentorului sau, Cristovao Ferreira, unul dintre cei mai de seama membri ai misiunii iezuite din Japonia, preotul Sebastian Rodrigues descopera in aceasta tara mai multe comunitati clandestine de crestini. Asistind neputincios la martiriul acestora, Rodrigues isi vede propria credinta pusa la incercare si incepe sa se indoiasca de un Dumnezeu care raspunde la suferintele credinciosilor sai doar printr-o tacere indiferenta. Vindut la rindul lui autoritatilor, supus la torturi cumplite si silit sa se dezica de credinta sa, Rodrigues are constiinta dureroasa a esecului, dar si revelatia faptului ca Dumnezeu este prezent intotdeauna, chiar si in tacere.„O opera remarcabila: sumbra, delicata si uluitor de empatica.” (John Updike) „Tacere este o capodopera, o drama lucida si eleganta.” (The New York Times Review of Books) „Cel mai bun roman al lui Endo... O carte splendida si tulburatoare, care i-a adus un prestigios premiu literar in Japonia si a fost tradusa in numeroase limbi.” (Times Literary Supplement) „Tacere este unul dintre cele mai frumoase romane istorice scrise vreodata... Pur si simplu fara cusur.” (The Washington Post)",9734645307,9789734645305),Paperback,2,256 pages,"

","We have a marvelous, almost legendary image of the circumstances in which the composition of this great poem began. Rainer Maria Rilke was staying at Duino Castle, on a rocky headland of the Adriatic Sea near Trieste. One morning he walked out onto the battlements and climbed down to where the cliffs dropped sharply to the sea. From out of the fierce wind, Rilke seemed to hear a voice: Wer, wenn ich schriee, horte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen? (If I cried out, who would hear me up there, among the angelic orders?). He wrote these words, the opening of the first Duino Elegy, in his notebook, then went inside to continue what was to be his major opus—completely only after another ten, tormented years of effort—and one of the literary masterpieces of the century. Duino Elegies speaks in a voice that is both intimate and majestic on the mysteries of human life and our attempt, in the words of the translator David Young, “to use our self-consciousness to some advantage: to transcend, through art and the imagination, our self-deception and our fear.”",0393328848,9780393328844),Paperback,,208 pages,"

","Set on the Korean island of Jeju, The Island of Sea Women follows Mi-ja and Young-sook, two girls from very different backgrounds, as they begin working in the sea with their village’s all-female diving collective. Over many decades—through the Japanese colonialism of the 1930s and 1940s, World War II, the Korean War, and the era of cellphones and wet suits for the women divers—Mi-ja and Young-sook develop the closest of bonds. Nevertheless, their differences are impossible to ignore: Mi-ja is the daughter of a Japanese collaborator, forever marking her, and Young-sook was born into a long line of haenyeo and will inherit her mother’s position leading the divers. After hundreds of dives and years of friendship, forces outside their control will push their relationship to the breaking point.This beautiful, thoughtful novel illuminates a unique and unforgettable culture, one where the women are in charge, engaging in dangerous physical work, and the men take care of the children. A classic Lisa See story—one of women’s friendships and the larger forces that shape them—The Island of Sea Women introduces readers to the fierce female divers of Jeju Island and the dramatic history that shaped their lives.",English,English,Hardcover,,374 pages,"

","Deming offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. ""Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment.""According to W. Edwards Deming, American companies require nothing less than a transformation of management style and of governmental relations with industry. In Out of the Crisis, originally published in 1982, Deming offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future, he claims, brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved product and service. In simple, direct language, he explains the principles of management transformation and how to apply them.Previously published by MIT-CAES",0262541157,9780262541152),Paperback,,524 pages,"

","George Washington Carver was born a slave in Missouri about 1864 and was raised by the childless white couple who had owned his mother. In 1877 he left home in search of an education, eventually earning a master's degree. In 1896, Booker T. Washington invited Carver to start the agricultural department at the all-black-staffed Tuskegee Institute, where he spent the rest of his life seeking solutions to the poverty among landless black farmers by developing new uses for soil-replenishing crops such as peanuts, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes. Carver's achievements as a botanist and inventor were balanced by his gifts as a painter, musician, and teacher. This Newbery Honor Book and Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book by Marilyn Nelson provides a compelling and revealing portrait of Carver's complex, richly interior, profoundly devout life.",1886910537,9781886910539),Hardcover,,112 pages,"

April, a stripper, has brought her daughter to work at the Puma Club for Men. There she encounters Bassam, a foreign client both remote and too personal and free with his money. Meanwhile, another man, AJ, has been thrown out of the club, and he’s drunk, angry, and lonely.

","With nearly a million copies sold, Joanna Weaver's popular book shows women how to blend intimacy with Jesus and service for Him.   An invitation for every woman who feels she isn't godly enough...isn't loving enough...isn't doing enough. The life of a woman today isn't really all that different from that of Mary and Martha in the New Testament. Like Mary, you long to sit at the Lord's feet...but the daily demands of a busy world just won't leave you alone. Like Martha, you love Jesus and really want to serve him...yet you struggle with weariness, resentment, and feelings of inadequacy. Then comes Jesus, right into the midst of your busy Mary/Martha life-and he extends the same invitation he issued long ago to the two sisters of Bethany. Tenderly he invites you to choose ""the better part""-a joyful life of ""living-room"" intimacy with him that flows naturally into ""kitchen service"" for him. How can you make that choice? With her fresh approach to the familiar Bible story and its creative, practical strategies, Joanna shows how all of us -Marys and Marthas alike- can draw closer to our Lord, deepening our devotion, strengthening our service, and doing both with less stress and greater joy. This book includes a twelve-week Bible study. Also look for the ten-week DVD study pack companion product to this book, which includes three DVDs and a separate, revised and expanded study guide.",1578562589,9781578562589),Paperback,,256 pages,"

","Dawn Prince-Hughes is an extraordinary researcher. She does not experiment or measure but instead sits on a wooden bench for hours each day, watching captive gorillas through the enclosure where other visitors average five-second stops. Her patience is rewarded with astounding observations—she watches gorillas make and use tools, bury a dead crow, give birth, and comfort and care for each other.In Gorillas among Us, Prince-Hughes has compressed years of gorilla observation into a composite diary chronicling the days of one gorilla family. She creates a blended portrait of both peoples—gorilla and human. The entries capture significant observations, which often prompt brief discussions of gorillas’ captivity, diet, communication, aesthetic preferences, social behavior, and play. Several chapters end with thought-provoking meditations on human values. The final section, “More about Gorillas,” provides a concise, accessible introduction to gorilla natural history.This book will delight and move anyone with an interest in animals, and it also makes a significant contribution to the scarce literature on captive gorillas. Prince-Hughes's observations of tool use by gorillas will interest scientists, and even a casual reader will come away with a new sense of the power of observation. The author hopes to change the way we look at animals in the wild and in captivity, and laments that zoo visitors pause so briefly in front of the gorilla enclosure, rushing on with their assumptions unchanged, without really seeing the gorillas.By turns opinionated and descriptive, quirky and authoritative, Prince-Hughes draws us into the family life of captive gorillas and into a consideration of our own culture. Readers will learn something new about gorillas and themselves on every page of this poignant story. The book testifies to the potential for interspecies compassion and the love that one person can find in a family of gorillas.",0816521514,9780816521517),Paperback,,153 pages,"

""Just remember,"" Yoshio said quietly to his grandsons. ""Every day of your lives, you must always be sure what you're fighting for."" It is Tokyo in 1939. On the Street of a Thousand Blossoms, two orphaned brothers are growing up with their loving grandparents, who inspire them to dream of a future firmly rooted in tradition. The older boy, Hiroshi, shows unusual skill at the national obsession of sumo wrestling, while Kenji is fascinated by the art of creating hard-carved masks for actors in the Noh theater.Across town, a renowned sumo master, Sho Tanaka, lives with his wife and their two young daughters: the delicate, daydreaming Aki and her independent sister, Haru. Life seems full of promise as Kenji begins an informal apprenticeship with the most famous mask-maker in Japan and Hiroshi receives a coveted invitation to train with Tanaka. But then Pearl Harbor changes everything. As the ripples of war spread to both families' quiet neighborhoods, all of the generations must put their dreams on hold---and then find their way in a new Japan.In an exquisitely moving story that spans almost thirty years, Gail Tsukiyama draws us irresistibly into the world of the brothers and the women who love them. It is a world of tradition and change, of heartbreaking loss and surprising hope, and of the impact of events beyond their control on ordinary, decent men and women. Above all, The Street of a Thousand Blossoms is a masterpiece about love and family from a glorious storyteller at the height of her powers.

But Parmenion, most powerful warrior of ancient Greece, had won a small victory over the darkness that sought to rule through Alexander. The boy's soul had not been destroyed by evil, but instead had merged with it -- and now Parmenion aided Alexander in the battle between light and dark that constantly raged within him.But there was another world, where the creatures of Greece's legends still flourished. There, the chaos spirit already ruled, through a demon king. In this Greece, there was a prophecy that a child of great power, the legendary golden child, would come and restore the fading magic of the land to the creatures of myth. The demon king believed also that devouring the heart of this fabled child would give him immortality. He believed Alexander, with the power of the chaos spirit within him, to be that child. And so he called Alexander into his world . . .Only Parmenion, guided by the seeress Derae, his lost love from another life, could hope to save Alexander from the demon king.

","Pliny’s Natural History is an astonishingly ambitious work that ranges from astronomy to art and from geography to zoology. Mingling acute observation with often wild speculation, it offers a fascinating view of the world as it was understood in the first century AD, whether describing the danger of diving for sponges, the first water-clock, or the use of asses’ milk to remove wrinkles. Pliny himself died while investigating the volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii in AD 79, and the natural curiosity that brought about his death is also very much evident in the Natural History — a book that proved highly influential right up until the Renaissance and that his nephew, Pliny the younger, described ‘as full of variety as nature itself’. John F. Healy has made a fascinating and varied selection from the Natural History for this clear, modern translation. In his introduction, he discusses the book and its sources topic by topic.

She is on a vengeful mission to track down and kill the murderous Kelso brothers. The group is joined by a jumble of other characters en route, each of whom are forced to confront their own demons.

","In Alaska, somebody disappears every day. Hunters who head into the wilderness… Fishermen who brave the great rivers…Tourists who attempt to do both. In Aleut detective Kate Shugak’s Park, people have been falling off the grid quite a bit lately. And as she and state trooper Jim Chopin are about to realize, it’s got something to do with the recent discovery of the world’s second-largest gold mine in their very own backyard.A hostile environmental activist organization has embraced Alaska’s Suulutaq Mine as its reason for being, attracting more attention than many of the locals can tolerate. So it’s almost a relief when Kate finally finds a body—this, more than politics, she can handle. Until the identity of the body vanishes, too… Now it’s up to Kate and Jim to dig deeper into the mining controversy and find the truth about what’s going on in her homeland. Even if that means facing down an enemy who will kill to keep certain secrets buried…",0312559097,9780312559090),Hardcover,,322 pages,"

It's the way she feels about the blonde with the silver-blue eyes leaning over her hospital bed when she finally wakes up. Sylvan, the Alpha of the Adirondack Timberlake Pack—the one woman Drake can't have. And the only one she wants. The first in the Midnight Hunters series.",English,English,Paperback,,288 pages,"

","The Unnamable consists entirely of a disjointed monologue from the perspective of an unnamed (presumably unnamable) and immobile protagonist. There is no concrete plot or setting - and whether the other characters (""Mahood"" (formerly ""Basil"") and ""Worm"") actually exist or whether they are facets of the narrator himself is debatable. The protagonist also claims authorship of the main characters in the two previous novels of the Trilogy and Beckett's earlier novels Murphy, Mercier and Camier, and Watt. The novel is a mix of recollections and existential musings on the part of its narrator, many of which pertain specifically to the possibility that the narrator is constructed by the language he speaks. Other 'characters' (a stretch to call them distinctly different than the narrator) serve as the passive recipient of the dialogue and in many places (as the narrator suggests) the dialogue's genesis. The novel builds in its despairing tone until the ending, which consists mainly of very long run-on sentences. It closes with the phrase ""I can't go on, I'll go on,"" which was later used as the title of an anthology of Beckett works.The Unnamable is a 1953 novel by Samuel Beckett. It is the third and final entry in Beckett's ""Trilogy"" of novels, which begins with Molloy followed by Malone Dies. It was originally published in French as L'Innommable and later translated by the author into English.

","Award-winning short story writer Ron Carlson delivers a stirring novel about three men confronting their pasts and their purpose  Beloved story writer Ron Carlson’s first novel in thirty years, Five Skies is the story of three men gathered high in the Rocky Mountains for a construction project that is to last the summer. Having participated in a spectacular betrayal in Los Angeles, the giant, silent Arthur Key drifts into work as a carpenter in southern Idaho. Here he is hired, along with the shiftless and charming Ronnie Panelli, to build a stunt ramp beside a cavernous void. The two will be led by Darwin Gallegos, the foreman of the local ranch who is filled with a primeval rage at God, at man, at life. As they endeavor upon this simple, grand project, the three reveal themselves in cautiously resonant, profound ways. And in a voice of striking intimacy and grace, Carlson’s novel reveals itself as a story of biblical, almost spiritual force. A bellwether return from one of our greatest craftsmen, Five Skies is sure to be one of the most praised and cherished novels of the year.",English,English,Hardcover,,256 pages,"

","Having put his personal stamp on the contemporary theater, David Mamet now performs the supremely audacious feat of reinventing the theater of the past. He does so by telling his own ingenious and eerily moving version of the tragedy of Dr. Faustus.Mamet’s Faustus—like Marlowe’s and Goethe’s before him—is a philosopher whose life’s work has been the pursuit of “the secret engine of the world.” He is also the distracted father of a small, adoring son. Out of the clash between love and intellect and the fatal operation of Faustus’ pride, Mamet fashions a work that is at once caustic and heart-wrenching and whose resplendent language marries metaphysics to conman’s patter. A meditation on reason and folly, fathers and sons, and a breathtaking display of magic both literal and theatrical, Faustus is a triumph.",0822221292,9780822221296),Paperback,,48 pages,"

","Dear Reader:In a previous life, before the time of Plum, I wrote twelve short romance novels. Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All went out-of-print immediately and then could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now beingre-released by HarperCollins. Love Overboard is second inthe lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. I've done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around. And I changed the title because I thought the original title (Ivan Takes a Wife) was boring!Love Overboard is a romantic tale about a handsome ship'scaptain; a wary wench from Jersey City; a hundred-year-old, two-masted schooner; and an entire town of shoemakers. There's some getting naked, some blueberry pie, more getting naked, and at the end . . . Okay, I won't tell you about the end, but it's really good and it'll make you feel happy.I took my family on the road trip from heck to research this book. When we finally got to Maine it was all worthwhile because we fell in love with the boats and the people who sailed them.Enjoy!",0060598840,9780060598846),Mass Market Paperback,,244 pages,"

","The acclaimed author of the groundbreaking bestseller Schoolgirls reveals the dark side of pink and pretty: the rise of the girlie-girl, she warns, is not that innocent.Sweet and sassy or predatory and hardened, sexualized girlhood influences our daughters from infancy onward, telling them that how a girl looks matters more than who she is. Somewhere between the exhilarating rise of Girl Power in the 1990s and today, the pursuit of physical perfection has been recast as the source of female empowerment. And commercialization has spread the message faster and farther, reaching girls at ever-younger ages. But how dangerous is pink and pretty, anyway? Being a princess is just make-believe; eventually they grow out of it . . . or do they?In search of answers, Peggy Orenstein visited Disneyland, trolled American Girl Place, and met parents of beauty-pageant preschoolers tricked out like Vegas showgirls. The stakes turn out to be higher than she ever imagined. From premature sexualization to the risk of depression to rising rates of narcissism, the potential negative impact of this new girlie-girl culture is undeniable—yet armed with awareness and recognition, parents can effectively counterbalance its influence in their daughters' lives.",0061711527,9780061711527),Hardcover,,245 pages,"

Before long, the two families' lives become entwined in unexpected ways, to the delight of Gracie, the sweetest of the Templeton children. In the years that follow, the relationships between the Templetons and the two Donovans twist and turn in unpredictable and life-changing directions, until a tragedy tears them all apart.

","DEATH MAGIC opens with Special Agent Lily Yu in Washington, D.C. with her fiancé--lupi prince Rule Turner—to testify before a Senate subcommittee about her role in the magical collapse of a mountain last month. She is not there to tell them about the strange legacy she carries from that event—or about the arcane bond between her and Rule--or what her boss in Unit Twelve of the FBI’s Magical Crimes Division is really up to. She sure won’t tell them that the lupi are at war with an Old One who wants to remake humanity in her own image. Lily is managing the conflict between her duty as an officer of the law and the need for secrecy pretty well . . . until the rabidly anti-magic senator who chairs that committee is murdered. The line between right and wrong, always so clear to her, becomes hopelessly blurred as events catapult them all towards disaster, and prophecies of a cataclysmic end to the country she loves and serves--and to the entire race of lupi--seem well on their way to being fulfilled.",B0052RDJXG,B0052RDJXG,Kindle Edition,1st Edition,377 pages,"

","A thrilling and powerful novel about a young boy lured to sea by the promise of adventure and reward, with echoes of Great Expectations, Moby-Dick, and The Voyage of the Narwhal.Jamrach’s Menagerie tells the story of a nineteenth-century street urchin named Jaffy Brown. Following an incident with an escaped tiger, Jaffy goes to work for Mr. Charles Jamrach, the famed importer of exotic animals, alongside Tim, a good but sometimes spitefully competitive boy. Thus begins a long, close friendship fraught with ambiguity and rivalry. Mr. Jamrach recruits the two boys to capture a fabled dragon during the course of a three-year whaling expedi­tion. Onboard, Jaffy and Tim enjoy the rough brotherhood of sailors and the brutal art of whale hunting. They even succeed in catching the reptilian beast. But when the ship’s whaling venture falls short of expecta­tions, the crew begins to regard the dragon—seething with feral power in its cage—as bad luck, a feeling that is cruelly reinforced when a violent storm sinks the ship. Drifting across an increasingly hallucinatory ocean, the sur­vivors, including Jaffy and Tim, are forced to confront their own place in the animal kingdom. Masterfully told, wildly atmospheric, and thundering with tension, Jamrach’s Mena­gerie is a truly haunting novel about friendship, sacrifice, and survival.",038553440X,9780385534406),Hardcover,,295 pages,"

","In Catalyst, award-winning authors Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough introduced readers to the beguiling Barque Cats: spacefaring felines who serve aboard starships as full-fledged members of the crew. Highly evolved, the cats share an almost telepathic bond with their minders, or Cat Persons—until, suddenly, there is no “almost” about it, and a particular Barque Cat, Chester, learns to exchange thoughts with his human friend, Jubal. Other cats soon gain the same ability.  Behind the seeming miracle is a mysterious cat named Pshaw-Ra, who possesses knowledge and technology far beyond anything the Barque Cats—or their humans—have ever seen. When fear of a virulent plague leads the government first to quarantine and then to kill all animals suspected of infection, Pshaw-Ra—with the help of Chester, Jubal, and the crew of the starship Ranzo—activates a “mousehole” in space that carries the refugees to a place of safety: Pshaw-Ra’s home planet of Mau, where godlike cats are worshiped by human slaves.  But Pshaw-Ra’s actions are less noble than they appear. The scheming cat plans to mate the Barque Cats with his own feline stock, creating a hybrid race of superior cats—a race destined to conquer the universe. Yet right from the start, his plans go awry.For one thing, there’s a new queen on Mau: Pshaw-Ra’s daughter Nefure, a spoiled brat—er, cat—with a temper as short as her attention span. Pshaw-Ra’s other daughter, the rightful queen Renpet, is exiled, running for her life in the only direction available to her—down into the vast catacombs beneath the Mauan desert. Far from receiving the hero’s welcome he expected, Pshaw-Ra must use every bit of his considerable cleverness just to survive.Meanwhile, as usual, Chester and Jubal stumble right into the middle of things, in the process uncovering the lost secrets of the Mauan civilization. But that’s not all they uncover. In the forgotten catacombs deep below the Mauan capital, something has awakened. Something as old as the universe. Something that hungers to devour all light and life—and that bears an undying hatred for cats.",English,English,Hardcover,,236 pages,"

","A desire of a homeschooling mother's heart is to have a meek and quiet spirit instead of discouragement, fear, and anger. She can cope with the myriad of daily difficulties and decisions that a homeschooling lifestyle brings with it, as long as she is having the right responses to them. Let her be fearful, worried, anxious, frustrated, irritated, or angry and a mom soon realizes she is undermining all she wants to accomplish by homeschooling. Because Teri Maxwell, a mother of eight, has walked the homeschooling path since 1985, she knows first-hand the struggle for a meek and quiet spirit. The memories from her early homeschooling years of often being worried and angry rather than having a meek and quiet spirit are not what she would like them to be.Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit includes Teri sharing the work the Lord has done in her heart through homeschooling. Other homeschooling moms will be encouraged that He can do the same for them. Teri also desires that homeschooling mothers could learn from the lessons the Lord has taught her so that they would begin to have a meek and quiet spirit long before she did.Will the reader's journey toward a meek and quiet spirit be completed upon finding the perfect spelling curriculum or deciding which chores a child should be doing? Or does the answer lie on a different path? In these pages, Teri offers practical insights into gaining a meek and quiet spirit, along with chapter-by-chapter projects, that any mom can apply to her individual circumstances. She transparently shares the struggles God has brought her through and what He has shown her during these many homeschooling years.Throughout Homeschooling with a Meek and Quiet Spirit, the heart issues that will gently lead you to a meek and quiet spirit are discovered. The reader is encouraged to join Teri as they seek the Lord to homeschool with a meek and quiet spirit! .",0966910710,9780966910711),Paperback,,128 pages,"

Ava’s mother, the park’s indomitable headliner, has just died; her sister, Ossie, has fallen in love with a spooky character known as the Dredgeman, who may or may not be an actual ghost; and her brilliant big brother, Kiwi, who dreams of becoming a scholar, has just defected to the World of Darkness in a last-ditch effort to keep their family business from going under. Ava’s father, affectionately known as Chief Bigtree, is AWOL; and that leaves Ava, a resourceful but terrified thirteen, to manage ninety-eight gators and the vast, inscrutable landscape of her own grief. Against a backdrop of hauntingly fecund plant life animated by ancient lizards and lawless hungers, Karen Russell has written an utterly singular novel about a family’s struggle to stay afloat in a world that is inexorably sinking.

","Boca do Inferno é uma composição de peças humorísticas com a assinatura inconfundível de Ricardo Araújo Pereira. Das crónicas que pervertem os assuntos mais banais às que colocam na berlinda políticos de ponta, o traço comum é uma ironia certeira, um olhar sempre inesperado, que nos surpreende de cada vez que julgamos nada mais haver para inventar.No Posfácio Relativamente Interessantíssimo, de Manuel Rosado Baptista, pode ler-se: ""Falar deste conjunto de crónicas de Ricardo de Araújo Pereira é, acima de tudo, perder tempo. Nada se poderá dizer delas que o leitor não descubra logo à primeira leitura - ou ainda antes. No entanto, poucas coisas serão mais estimulantes para os ociosos do que uma tarefa fácil.""",9728955421,9789728955427),Paperback,,294 pages,"

","“The bard of biological weapons capturesthe drama of the front lines.”-Richard Danzig, former secretary of the navyThe first major bioterror event in the United States-the anthrax attacks in October 2001-was a clarion call for scientists who work with “hot” agents to find ways of protecting civilian populations against biological weapons. In The Demon in the Freezer, his first nonfiction book since The Hot Zone, a #1 New York Times bestseller, Richard Preston takes us into the heart of Usamriid, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, once the headquarters of the U.S. biological weapons program and now the epicenter of national biodefense.Peter Jahrling, the top scientist at Usamriid, a wry virologist who cut his teeth on Ebola, one of the world’s most lethal emerging viruses, has ORCON security clearance that gives him access to top secret information on bioweapons. His most urgent priority is to develop a drug that will take on smallpox-and win. Eradicated from the planet in 1979 in one of the great triumphs of modern science, the smallpox virus now resides, officially, in only two high-security freezers-at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and in Siberia, at a Russian virology institute called Vector. But the demon in the freezer has been set loose. It is almost certain that illegal stocks are in the possession of hostile states, including Iraq and North Korea. Jahrling is haunted by the thought that biologists in secret labs are using genetic engineering to create a new superpox virus, a smallpox resistant to all vaccines.Usamriid went into a state of Delta Alert on September 11 and activated its emergency response teams when the first anthrax letters were opened in New York and Washington, D.C. Preston reports, in unprecedented detail, on the government’s response to the attacks and takes us into the ongoing FBI investigation. His story is based on interviews with top-level FBI agents and with Dr. Steven Hatfill.Jahrling is leading a team of scientists doing controversial experiments with live smallpox virus at CDC. Preston takes us into the lab where Jahrling is reawakening smallpox and explains, with cool and devastating precision, what may be at stake if his last bold experiment fails.From the Hardcover edition.",English,English,Kindle Edition,,256 pages,"

","Every time a new Jacqueline Wilson book arrives, there is always a small part of every reviewer that dreads opening the book in case this time the author has missed the mark. But as yet, Wilson has never disappointed either the critics or her customers, and with Vicky Angel she once again pulls a little magic out of the hat and delivers another stunning novel with her trademark sensitivity and panache.Jade and Vicky are best friends, but when Vicky is killed in an accident she doesn't let a little old thing like being dead interfere with her life. Instead, she continues as normal, following Jade around, telling her what to do, how to think, how to behave and ruining any chance Jade may have to make new friends. Eventually Jade tires of it all, and although she still loves Vicky deeply, she realises she has to get on with her own life.Once again, Wilson digs deep and delves into tricky territory with a tenacity that at first shocks; but within a few minutes the shock subsides and the reader is drawn into Jade's world, willing her to come to terms with Vicky's death and praying that she will soon find her own way.As ever, Wilson's characters are beautifully observed, and the story is filled to the brim with an emotional truth that is awe inspiring and captivating. Jade's response to Vicky's death, her realisation that the pedestal on which Vicky was placed during her short life was not as stable as she first believed and the ultimate release from the burden of guilt and love are dealt with with a sleight of hand that allows the reader to become completely involved with the story without a hint of darkness, captured instead by a lightness of touch that can only serve to make Wilson's peers green with envy.The Illustrated Mum was the absolute best. Vicky Angel, a sort of Truly, Madly, Deeply for kids, runs an extraordinarily tight second. (Age 8 and over) --Susan Harrison",0440867800,9780440867807),Paperback,,256 pages,"

With enormous compassion, Dr. James Delaney tends to his hurt, sick, and poor neighbors, who include gangsters, day laborers, prostitutes, and housewives. If they can't pay, he treats them anyway. But in his own life, Delaney is emotionally numb, haunted by the slaughters of the Great War. His only daughter has left for Mexico, and his wife Molly vanished months before, leaving him to wonder if she is alive or dead. Then, on a snowy New Year's Day, the doctor returns home to find his three-year-old grandson on his doorstep, left by his mother in Delaney's care. Coping with this unexpected arrival, Delaney hires Rose, a tough, decent Sicilian woman with a secret in her past. Slowly, as Rose and the boy begin to care for the good doctor, the numbness in Delaney begins to melt.

","The patients of the Sacred Heart Hospital for All Ailments are looking for a miracle, and Alice Bhatti is looking for a job. Alice is a candidate for the position of junior nurse, grade 4. It is only a few weeks since her release from Borstal. She has returned to her childhood home in the French Colony, where her father, recently retired from his position as chief janitor, continues as part-time healer, and full-time headache for the local church. It seems she has inherited some of his gift.With guidance from the working nurse’s manual, and some tricks she picked up in prison, Alice brings succour to the thousands of patients littering the hospital’s corridors and concrete courtyard. In the process she attracts the attention of a lovesick patient, Teddy Bunt, apprentice to the nefarious ‘Gentleman Squad’ of the Karachi police. They fall in love; Teddy with sudden violence, Alice with cautious optimism.Their love is unexpected, but the consequences are not.Alice soon finds that her new life is built on foundations as unstable as those of her home. A Catholic snubbed by other Catholics, who are in turn hated by everyone around them, she is also put at risk by her husband, who does two things that no member of the Gentlemen Squad has ever done – fall in love with a working girl, and allow a potentially dangerous suspect to get away. Can Teddy and Alice ever live in peace? Can two people make a life together without destroying the very thing that united them? It seems unlikely, but then Alice Bhatti is no ordinary nurse...Filled with wit, colour and pathos, Our Lady of Alice Bhatti is a glorious story of second chances, thwarted ambitions and love in unlikely places, set in the febrile streets of downtown Karachi. It is the remarkable new novel from the author of A Case of Exploding Mangoes.",0224082051,9780224082051),Hardcover,,240 pages,"

A cobra has been found in Precious Ramotswe’s office. Then a nurse from a local medical clinic reveals that faulty blood–pressure readings are being recorded there. And Botswana has a new advice columnist, Aunty Emang, whose advice is rather curt for Mma Ramotswe’s taste.All this means a lot of work for our heroine and her inestimable assistant, Grace Makutsi, and they are, of course, up to the challenge. But there’s trouble brewing in Mma Makutsi’s own life. When Phuti Radiphuti misses their customary dinner date, she begins to wonder if he is having second thoughts about their engagement. And while Mma Makutsi may be able to buy that fashionably narrow (and uncomfortable) pair of blue shoes, it may not buy her the happiness that Mma Ramotswe promises her she’ll find in the simpler things—in contentment with the world and enough tea to smooth over the occasional bumps in the road.",1400075718,9781400075713),Paperback,,256 pages,"

This series revolves around contemporary issues in families and relationships.Steven Briggs is thirty-five, gorgeous and partially successful as an auto shop owner-wannabe. He loves women - young women to be exact. Moreover, he is not above manipulating any situation to have the women he wants. Independent twenty year old Jillian McConnell was once lucky to be a part of his world. Since Stevie was the only man to ever shatter her rough exterior, he knows that she would always keep coming back for more. But Jillian is only good enough some of the time. When the sensual Jessica Rodney comes of age, Stevie is enthralled. He shuns the older part time model, for the time being. But is Jessica's liveliness enough to sustain Stevie? Or will he keep turning back to the sensible relationship of his past, since he can always make Jillian believe that she should readily be a willing participant in this triangle. Damaged Girls is a complicated novel about the choices and outcomes, associated with the mistakes we make over time.Book Trailer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wf8B...",English,English,Paperback,,320 pages,"

","A tour de force of investigative journalism-this is the story of the violent rise and fall of Pablo Escobar, the head of the Colombian Medellin cocaine cartel. Escobar's criminal empire held a nation of thirty million hostage in a reign of terror that would only end with his death. In an intense, up-close account, award-winning journalist Mark Bowden exposes details never before revealed about the U.S.-led covert sixteen-month manhunt. With unprecedented access to important players-including Colombian president C&eacutesar Gaviria and the incorruptible head of the special police unit that pursued Escobar, Colonel Hugo Martinez-as well as top-secret documents and transcripts of Escobar's intercepted phone conversations, Bowden has produced a gripping narrative that is a stark portrayal of rough justice in the real world. ""The story of how the U.S. Army Intelligence and Delta Force commandos helped Colombian police track down and kill Pablo Escobar is a compelling, almost Shakespearean tale.""

But in 1995 a lost file from the State Archives turned up, a file that contained the complete interrogations of Rasputin’s inner circle.

","Chely Wright, singer, songwriter, country music star, writes in this moving, telling memoir about her life and her career; about growing up in America’s heartland, the youngest of three children; about barely remembering a time when she didn’t know she was different. She writes about her parents, putting down roots in their twenties in the farming town of Wellsville, Kansas, Old Glory flying atop the poles on the town’s manicured lawns, and being raised to believe that hard work, honesty, and determination would take her far.  She writes of making up her mind at a young age to become a country music star, knowing then that her feelings and crushes on girls were “sinful” and hoping and praying that she would somehow be “fixed.” (“Dear God, please don’t let me be gay. I promise not to lie. I promise not to steal. I promise to always believe in you . . . Please take it away.”) We see her, high school homecoming queen, heading out on her own at seventeen and landing a job as a featured vocalist on the Ozark Jubilee (the show that started Brenda Lee, Red Foley, and Porter Wagoner), being cast in Country Music U.S.A., doing four live shows a day, and—after only a few months in Nashville—her dream coming true, performing on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry . . .  She describes writing and singing her own songs for producers who’d discovered and recorded the likes of Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, and Toby Keith, who heard in her music something special and signed her to a record contract, releasing her first album and sending her out on the road on her first bus tour . . . She writes of sacrificing all for a shot at success that would come a couple of years later with her first hit single, “Shut Up And Drive” . . . her songs (from her fourth album, Single White Female) climbing the Billboard chart for twenty-nine weeks, hitting the #1 spot . . .   She writes about the friends she made along the way—Vince Gill, Brad Paisley, and others—writing songs, recording and touring together, some of the friendships developing into romantic attachments that did not end happily . . . Keeping the truth of who she was clutched deep inside, trying to ignore it in a world she longed to be a part of—and now was—a world in which country music stars had never been, could not be, openly gay . . . She writes of the very real prospect of losing everything she’d worked so hard to create . . . doing her best to have a real life—her best not good enough . . .  And in the face of everything she did to keep herself afloat, she writes about how the vortex of success and hiding who she was took its toll: her life, a tangled mess she didn’t see coming, didn’t want to; and, finally, finding the guts to untangle herself from the image of the country music star she’d become, an image steeped in long-standing ideals and notions about who—and what—a country artist is, and what their fans expect them to be . . . I am a songwriter,” she writes. “I am a singer of my songs—and I have a story to tell. As I’ve traveled this path that has delivered me to where I am today, my monument of thanks, paying honor to God, remains. I will do all I can with what I have been given . . .”  Like Me is fearless, inspiring, true. ",English,English,Hardcover,,304 pages,"

","A witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive read that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.The Antidote is a series of journeys among people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that it's our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative ""negative path"" to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clients' lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes we've made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the ""backwards"" business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a company's future. Burkeman's new book is a witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive read that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.",1429947608,9781429947602),ebook,,256 pages,"

","Welcome to Glacier Country! Luthor Devlin and his ranch hands were out tracking 20th-century rustlers when they stepped into a time warp! There on the jagged cliffs was a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a tawny, near-naked savage. She was a primal fantasy come true - that left him stunned!His gaze locked onto hers. ""I'd really appreciate an explanation of all this. You, the hairy elephant, and the cat with the overbite are not the norm in Montana. And I know you can understand my every word. So anytime you'd like to begin.""Her relaxed appraisal hadn't gone unnoticed by either the man or the large tiger. The latter proved her undoing. His mouth opened not to snarl again but to emit a long, loud, kittenish yawn. The tiger rolled over, rubbed his back and shoulders into the ground, his hind legs spread-eagle, yawned again, and pawed sleepily at his face. To the amazement of everyone, his sword-like teeth fell out.""Damn it, Pumpkin, why couldn't you have just growled!"" She extended her hand. ""Cam Stirling, action technician."" At his confused expression, she sighed. ""Stunt woman.""She was wild, irresistible - and he was the man to tame her.

","Four United States presidents have been assassinated -- in 1865, 1881, 1901, and 1963 -- each murder seemingly unrelated and separated by time.But what if those presidents were all killed for the same reason: a clause in the United States Constitution -- contained within Article 1, Section 8 -- that would shock Americans?This question is what faces former Justice Department operative Cotton Malone in his latest adventure. When a bold assassination attempt is made against President Danny Daniels in the heart of Manhattan, Malone risks his life to foil the killing -- only to find himself at dangerous odds with the Commonwealth, a secret society of pirates first assembled during the American Revolution. In their most perilous exploit yet, Malone and Cassiopeia Vitt race across the nation and take to the high seas. Along the way they break a secret cipher originally possessed by Thomas Jefferson, unravel a mystery concocted by Andrew Jackson, and unearth a centuries-old document forged by the Founding Fathers themselves, one powerful enough -- thanks to that clause in the Constitution -- to make the Commonwealth unstoppable.",0345505514,9780345505514),Hardcover,,456 pages,"

","In this cycle of 14 bittersweet stories, Walter Mosley breaks out of the genre--if not the setting--of his bestselling Easy Rawlins detective novels. Only eight years after serving out a prison sentence for murder, Socrates Fortlow lives in a tiny, two-room Watts apartment, where he cooks on a hot plate, scavenges for bottles, drinks and wrestles with his demons. Struggling to control a seemingly boundless rage--as well as the power of his massive ""rock-breaking"" hands--Socrates must find a way to live an honourable life as a black man on the margins of a white world, a task which takes every ounce of self-control he has.  Easy Rawlins fans might initially find themselves disappointed by the absence of a mystery to unravel. But it's a gripping inner drama that unfolds over the pages of these stories, as Socrates comes to grips with the chaos, poverty and violence around him. He tries to get and keep a job delivering groceries; takes in a young street kid named Darryl, who has his own murder to hide; and helps drive out the neighbourhood crack dealer. Throughout, Mosley captures the rhythms of Watts life in prose both lyrical and hard-edged, resulting in a haunting look at a life bounded by lust, violence, fear and a ruthlessly unsentimental moral vision.",1852427027,9781852427023),Paperback,,208 pages,"

For a decade they are unbeatable and inseparable, working as trail hands throughout the West until finally settling with Cal Brennan’s Slash Y. Their rough cowboy ethics see them through every imaginable challenge: blizzards, rustlers, outlaws, and card games gone wrong. Partial to pretty women, gambling, and practical jokes, Monte is often on the receiving end of trouble, while Chet is always there to break him out of jail or serve as a decoy until Monte can get out of town in a hurry. As the West begins to change, however—the automobile replacing the horse, the herds breaking up—the two friends part ways. Chet marries and goes on to become a successful merchant, banker, and politician; but Monte, unable to imagine anything but the cowboy’s way of life, refuses to the end to leave the range.",0803291213,9780803291218),Paperback,,442 pages,"

","There are places that I have never forgotten. A little cobbled street in a smoky mill town in the North of England has haunted me for the greater part of my life. It was inevitable that I should write about it and the people who lived on both sides of its ""Invisible Wall."" The narrow street where Harry Bernstein grew up, in a small English mill town, was seemingly unremarkable. It was identical to countless other streets in countless other working-class neighborhoods of the early 1900s, except for the ""invisible wall"" that ran down its center, dividing Jewish families on one side from Christian families on the other. Only a few feet of cobblestones separated Jews from Gentiles, but socially, it they were miles apart.On the eve of World War I, Harry's family struggles to make ends meet. His father earns little money at the Jewish tailoring shop and brings home even less, preferring to spend his wages drinking and gambling. Harry's mother, devoted to her children and fiercely resilient, survives on her dreams: new shoes that might secure Harry's admission to a fancy school; that her daughter might marry the local rabbi; that the entire family might one day be whisked off to the paradise of America.Then Harry's older sister, Lily, does the unthinkable: She falls in love with Arthur, a Christian boy from across the street. When Harry unwittingly discovers their secret affair, he must choose between the morals he's been taught all his life, his loyalty to his selfless mother, and what he knows to be true in his own heart.A wonderfully charming memoir written when the author was ninety-three, The Invisible Wall vibrantly brings to life an all-but-forgotten time and place. It is a moving tale of working-class life, and of the boundaries that can be overcome by love.",0345495802,9780345495808),Hardcover,,297 pages,"

","This trilogy of novels about World War II, largely based on his own experiences as an army officer, is the crowning achievement of Evelyn Waugh's career. Its central character is Guy Crouchback, head of an ancient but decayed Catholic family, who at first discovers new purpose in the challenge to defend Christian values against Nazi barbarism, but then gradually finds the complexities and cruelties of war too much for him. Yet, though often somber, the Sword of Honour trilogy is also a brilliant comedy, peopled by the fantastic figures so familiar from Waugh's early satires. The deepest pleasures these novels afford come from observing a great satiric writer employ his gifts with extraordinary subtlety, delicacy, and human feeling, for purposes that are ultimately anything but satiric.",0679431365,9780679431367),Hardcover,,711 pages,"

Is there room for love in a heart full of secrets? 
One year ago, before Fate took a wrecking ball to his life, Nichol was happily working on his doctorate in linguistics. Now he’s hip deep in sheep, mud and collies. His late brother and mother had been well suited to life on Seacliff Farm. Nichol? Not so much. As lambing season progresses in the teeth of an icy north wind, the last straw is the intruder Nichol catches in the barn. He says his name is Cam, and he’s on the run from a Glasgow gang. Something about the young man’s tired resignation touches Nichol deeply, and instead of giving him the business end of a shotgun, he offers Cam a blanket and a place to stay. Somehow, Cam quickly charms his way through Nichol’s defenses and into his heart. Even his grandfather takes to the cheeky city boy, whose hard work and good head for figures help set the farm back on its feet. As the cold Scottish springtime melts into summer, Nichol finds himself falling in love. When tragedy strikes, Cam’s resolutely held secret is finally revealed and Nichol must face the truth. He’s given his heart away, and it’s time to pay the price. Warning: Contains explicit M/M sex and the disruption of a quiet Scottish town by a fistfight and some tight designer jeans.

","Instant electronic access to digital information is the single most distinguishing attribute of the information age. The elaborate retrieval mechanisms that support such access are a product of technology. But technology is not enough. The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it. Just as the practical field of engineering has theoretical physics as its underlying base, the design of systems for organizing information rests on an intellectual foundation. The subject of this book is the systematized body of knowledge that constitutes this foundation.Integrating the disparate disciplines of descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging, indexing, and classification, the book adopts a conceptual framework that views the process of organizing information as the use of a special language of description called a bibliographic language. The book is divided into two parts. The first part is an analytic discussion of the intellectual foundation of information organization. The second part moves from generalities to particulars, presenting an overview of three bibliographic languages: work languages, document languages, and subject languages. It looks at these languages in terms of their vocabulary, semantics, and syntax. The book is written in an exceptionally clear style, at a level that makes it understandable to those outside the discipline of library and information science.",0262194333,9780262194334),Hardcover,,255 pages,"

Indeed, argues Bentham, Paul's works even contradict the teachings of Christ. It is likely the books ascribed to Paul, many of which are merely letters to early Christian churches, were added by the church because the doctrine of Paul allows the church to play a far larger role in the life of Christians than would be the case without the books included. Paul wanted the various churches he visited to practice Christianity his way. His letters tell them to do so, and apparently some influential leaders of the early and later church approved. Whatever the case, Bentham offers convincing proof that an infallible God could not have inspired the writings of Paul, which are far from infallible. In Bentham's view, Paul plays the role of an anti-Christ by making Christ subservient to Paul in the doctrine of Christianity.",English,English,Paperback,,280 pages,"

When Jamie's mother inherits a small island, and moves her little family from Harlem to Ireland, her troubled son sees a chance to start over, far away from the bullies and the pitying stares. Cancer has left Jamie without an arm or the will to speak. But Muck Island offers more than solitude and sea views.

","Winner of a 2015 Alex Award""Delightfully odd...A fine cast of misfits and dreamers and foes. A."" —Entertainment Weekly  “A deliciously dark confection of a novel, and one of the most thoroughly enjoyable books I’ve read in years.” —Celeste Ng, author of Everything I Never Told You  “Warm, entertaining and thoughtful, and a glorious celebration of music.” — Minneapolis Star Tribune   Fifteen years ago, a murder-suicide in room 712 rocked the grand old Bellweather Hotel and the young bridesmaid who witnessed it, Minnie Graves. Now hundreds of high school musicians have gathered at the Bellweather for the annual Statewide festival; Minnie has returned to face her demons; and a blizzard is threatening to trap them all inside. When a young prodigy disappears from infamous room 712, the search for her entwines an eccentric cast of conductors and caretakers, teenagers on the verge and adults haunted by memories. A genre-bending page-turner, full of playful nods to pop-culture classics from The Shining to Agatha Christie to Glee, Bellweather Rhapsody is a winning new novel from a writer to watch.  “Funny and exuberant, twisty and captivating . . . For its darkness and its glee, I loved this novel.” — Robin Sloan, author of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore   “A rollicking story . . . Racculia’s exuberant voice inspires laugh-out-loud moments while also bringing to life broken people who find solace in each other’s heartaches.” — Wisconsin State Journal",B00E78IB0W,B00E78IB0W,Kindle Edition,,354 pages,"

","HeartbreakerThe ranch she'd inherited was nearly bankrupt, and now Michelle discovered that she was also deeply in debt to John Rafferty, the tough-talking, hard-loving rancher who'd fascinated her since their first meeting years ago. But that fascination also scared her, and never more so than now, when he suggested a bargain that was far more tempting than it should have been. She refused to become his mistress in exchange for canceling the loan, for self-preservation as much as for anything else...White LiesYou don't argue with the FBI. So when they summoned Jay Granger to identify her gravely injured, heavily bandaged ex-husband, she agreed to keep a bedside vigil. Strangely, even unconscious, Steve Crossfield wasn't at all like the husband she remembered. As he struggled toward awareness, he demonstrated a strength of character, a manly power, the old Steve had lacked. Ironically, she was more drawn to him than ever. When Steve finally awoke, Jay had a unique chance to recapture—and even embellish—the past. But would the new Steve ever share her cherished memories?Heartbreaker originally published as a Silhouette intimate moments, 1987.

","Mengapa sejarah menjadi penting? Alasan utamanya adalah karena dengan memahami sejarah segala hal yang ada sekarang menjadi make sense. Ya! Sejarah sedikit banyak membuat kita mengerti akan segala hal yang ada sekarang. Dengan memahami sejarah kita bisa menjadi maklum atau setidaknya mengerti mengapa Amerika menjadi pusat ilmu pengetahuan dan universitasnya menjadi acuan dunia saat ini atau kita juga jadi mengerti mengapa berbagai peperangan di masa lalu dimulai oleh negara-negara tertentu di sekitar asia tengah dan juga berbagai hal lainnya. Namun tentu saja buku perang eropa jilid II ini tidak bisa menjawab semua rasa ingin tahu kita. Tapi setidaknya buku ini cukup membuka wawasan kita akan beberapa hal.Buku ini adalah kelanjutan dari Perang Eropa Jilid I. Jika pada jilid I digambarkan terutama tentang kedigdayaan Jerman di medan perang sehingga bisa menguasai daratan Eropa dan afrika bagian utara (nyaris saja termasuk Uni Sovyet) tanpa ada perlawanan yang berarti dari negara yang diinvasinya, maka jilid II ini menggambarkan sebaliknya. Sekutu strikes back! Mungkin ini kalimat yang tepat menggambarkan keseluruhan buku ini.Walaupun dalam jilid I sudah mulai digambarkan sedikit pada bagian akhir buku itu tentang sekutu yang mulai unggul di kawasan afrika utara, jilid II ini menggambarkan lebih banyak lagi keunggulan sekutu di medan perang. Penggambaran keunggulan itu terutama penguasaan itali hingga hingga penyerbuan oleh angkatan udara sekutu ke pabrik penyulingan minyak di rumania juga penyerangan ke beberapa kota di jerman.Selain itu juga, digambarkan peranan para pejuang-pejuang bawah tanah di negara-negara dataran eropa yang berusaha mengusir pasukan jerman dari tanah airnya. Sehingga muncul nama-nama pemimpin pemberontakan itu seperti joseph broz tito di yugoslavia, odette di perancis, odd starheim di norwegia, dan beberapa orang di polandia.Unuk masalah teknologi perang, digambarkan juga beberapa teknologi dan persenjataan yang digunakan selama perang. Terakhir, yang juga ditonjolkan dalam buku ini adalah hubugan antara inggris dan amerika yang tergabung dalam sekutu. Digambarkan bagaimana perbedaan pemikiran diantaranya keduanya dan juga kerjasama yang dilakukan.",Indonesian,Indonesian,Paperback,,410 pages,"

But now a name from the past resurfaces, thanks to CIA agent Catherine Ling who knows all too well what it’s like to lose a child.After teaming up with Agent Ling to find her missing son, Eve and Catherine share a bond forged by their mutual pain. Now, Catherine challenges Eve with a name: John Gallo. A man from Eve’s past. A man, seemingly raised from the dead, whose whereabouts are unknown. Could Gallo be the missing piece to the puzzle that has haunted Eve for years? Why was he in Atlanta just before Bonnie’s disappearance? With a brilliant narrative that goes back to Eve Duncan’s early life, exploring her history and motivations like no other novel before, Eve reveals long-guarded secrets and is guaranteed to leave Johansen fans panting for more—soon to come in Quinn (October 2011).",0312651201,9780312651206),Hardcover,,378 pages,"

","Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.  That same morning, Jenni opens a bedroom door to find her husband devouring their toddler son. Fate puts Jenni and Katie—total strangers—together in a pickup, fleeing the suddenly zombie-filled streets of the Texas city in which they live. Before the sun has set, they have become more than just friends and allies—they are bonded as tightly as any two people who have been to war together. During their cross-Texas odyssey to find and rescue Jenni’s oldest son, Jenni discovers the joy of watching a zombie’s head explode when she shoots its brains out. Katie learns that she’s a terrific tactician—and a pretty good shot. A chance encounter puts them on the road to an isolated, fortified town, besieged by zombies, where fewer than one hundred people cling to the shreds of civilization. It looks like the end of the world. But Katie and Jenni and many others will do whatever they have to to stay alive. Run, fight, pick each other up when they stumble, fall in love…anything is possible at the end of the world.

After everything the Russian mob boss Anton Avdonin has done to keep his family safe from the dangers of the world surrounding them, he never thought it would come down to this. The officials are knocking, the charges are piling, his wife is hurting, and they’re facing a fate he never thought to consider. He didn’t just make one mistake … no, he made many. It’s time to answer for them all. Viviana “Vine” Avdonin is stuck watching the life she adores crumble around her. Bad decisions have led to terrible consequences in more ways than one. She doesn’t have time to recover from one devastating tragedy that leaves her shattered before the next one is crushing down, too.

Sometimes they have to walk it alone … because forgiveness isn’t always black and white and love can be blurred by pain. With the blissful ignorance gone and the blinders removed, how much of themselves will they have to sacrifice to come out on top one last time?When everyone has a score to settle, it’s hard to notice the person causing the most heartache is the one staring back in the mirror.

","I Want You to Be My Second is a short story collection about young people dating, hooking up, getting things wrong and trying to make them right. In his first book, John-Mark Davidson creates a less than perfect world of romance. The stories follow a handful of flawed characters from the confusing kisses of adolescence, through the blurry parties of college, to the this-isn't-where-I-thought-I-would-be mornings of adulthood. A newly-single man masters the science of picking up women in STD clinics. A college freshman's mistake prompts him to sneak off to North Dakota. And a traveling businessman neglects a multi-million-dollar crisis by stopping at a bar. Arrows whizz above a city. Lies are told. Truths are confessed. Consequences swell slowly. Lovers split, but never really leave. A dead man ascends. A young woman stumbles. And someone is hiding under the bed. I Want You to Be My Second is rich in emotion, snappy with dialogue and offers up as many jokes as it does heavy moments. This book is for everyone who didn't get it right the first time.

","Twelve miles above the Pacific Ocean, a missile strikes a jumbo passenger jet. The flight crew is crippled or dead. Now, defying both nature and man, three survivors must achieve the impossible. Land the plane. From master storyteller Nelson DeMille and master pilot Thomas Block comes Mayday, the classic bestseller that packs a supersonic shock at every turn of the page....the most terrifyingly realistic air disaster thriller ever. Like a growing tidal wave, the escaping air was gathering momentum. A teenaged girl in aisle 18, seat D, near the port-side aisle, her seat dislocated by the original impact, suddenly found herself gripping her seat track on the floor, her overturned seat still strapped to her body. The seatbelt failed and the seat shot down the aisle. She lost her grip and was dragged after it. Her eyes were filled with horror as she dug her nails into the carpet, as the racing air pulled her toward the yawning hole that led outside. Her cries were unheard by even those passengers who sat barely inches away from her struggle. The noise of the escaping air was so loud that it was no longer decipherable as sound, but seemed instead a solid thing pounding at the people in their seats......",0446604763,9780446604765),Paperback,Revision of 1979 original,480 pages,"

","The New York Times bestselling author of Better and Complications reveals the surprising power of the ordinary checklist We live in a world of great and increasing complexity, where even the most expert professionals struggle to master the tasks they face. Longer training, ever more advanced technologies‚neither seems to prevent grievous errors. But in a hopeful turn, acclaimed surgeon and writer Atul Gawande finds a remedy in the humblest and simplest of techniques: the checklist.First introduced decades ago by the U.S. Air Force, checklists have enabled pilots to fly aircraft of mind-boggling sophistication. Now innovative checklists are being adopted in hospitals around the world, helping doctors and nurses respond to everything from flu epidemics to avalanches. Even in the immensely complex world of surgery, a simple ninety-second variant has cut the rate of fatalities by more than a third.In riveting stories, Gawande takes us from Austria, where an emergency checklist saved a drowning victim who had spent half an hour underwater, to Michigan, where a cleanliness checklist in intensive care units virtually eliminated a type of deadly hospital infection. He explains how checklists actually work to prompt striking and immediate improvements. And he follows the checklist revolution into fields well beyond medicine, from homeland security to investment banking, skyscraper construction, and businesses of all kinds.An intellectual adventure in which lives are lost and saved and one simple idea makes a tremendous difference, The Checklist Manifesto is essential reading for anyone working to get things right.

","Nostradamus finally meets his match - internationally famous magician and debunker of New Age quackery - James Randi!The Mask of Nostradamus is the first in-depth biography of this intriguing sixteenth-century astrologer and physician whose book of prophecies, The Centuries, is claimed by many to have foretold the Great Fire of London, the French Revolution, the rise of Hitler, and other crucial historical events. In his superb study of Nostradamus' life and times, Randi shows the extent to which contemporary beliefs in magic and astrology adulterated sixteenth-century science, and how Nostradamus used his skills as a physician and poet to become a cherished counselor to the courts of Europe. Finally, Randi exposes some of the tricks used by Nostradamus to make his prophecies seem authentic, and the rationalizations of his predictions by his followers through the centuries.Four hundred years after his death, Nostradamus continues to fascinate us. This is the first serious exploration of this complex figure whose fame still echoes in our own time.",0879758309,9780879758301),Paperback,,265 pages,"

In fact, as the anniversary of the tragedy that destroyed her life looms large, she'll do anything to erase the painful memories, including overdoing the tequila and making a pass at the most annoyingly inappropriate man on the planet.

","Cartea de față este dedicată Dianei Sorescu (1987-2013), o talentată jurnalistă, plecată dintre noi prea devreme, la doar 26 de ani. Nu puțini au fost cei profund impresionați de destinul ei tragic, atât apropiați, cât și cei care nu o cunoșteau, dar care au auzit de povestea ei. Cu o experiență de 7 ani în domeniu, Diana a debutat în lumea presei încă din adolescență, știind că acesta este drumul pe care vrea să-l urmeze. De-a lungul timpului, ea a lucrat la diferite publicații din presa scrisă sau online precum Unica, Tonica, Miresici, www.feminis.ro, www.divahair.ro, dar și în cadrul posturilor Pro Tv și Antena 3. Ea era cunoscută de cititori și prieteni drept Diana cu Vanilie, numele sub care scria, cu vervă și franchețe, un blog despre oameni și viață, despre lumea din jurul ei. Această carte reunește gândurile împărtășite de Diana cu Vanilie pe blogul ei, grupate în trei capitole ,,Începuturi”, ,,Oameni” și ,,Nebuloase”, precum și 18 poezii ale autoarei. „Scriu aceste rânduri într-un avion, înainte de decolare, între două drumuri. Cam așa e mereu viața mea. Și mă gândesc adesea, înainte să urc printre nori, că orice astfel de moment e un exercițiu, o frântură din drumul pe care îl voi face odată, ca orice om, către cer, fără bilet de întoarcere. Nu e nimic dramatic sau trist în acest sentiment. Poate să pară ciudat, dar nici un pic de teamă nu mă încearcă atunci când știu că va veni momentul să mă înalț. Să întâlnesc acolo oameni ce mi-au zâmbit odată, aici, pe pământ, și care sunt Îngeri de-o vreme. Ca și mama mea odinioară, Diana și-a luat zborul lăsând în urmă zâmbet de femeie tânără, licărire de talent, inspirație și ceva în plus: mireasmă de vanilie. Ea nu a plecat de tot. Versurile ei îi trădează prezența suavă printre noi. Le voi așeza cuminte pe noptiera mea, revenind la ele de câte ori valul vieții mă face să uit ce înseamnă a trăi frumos, atât cât ți-e dat. Ce înseamnă feminitate. Mulțumesc, Diana, draga mea dragă!” Andreea Marin",Romanian,Romanian,Paperback,,176 pages,"

In the days before the Civil War, a runaway slave named Liz Spocott breaks free from her captors and escapes into the labyrinthine swamps of Maryland’s eastern shore, setting loose a drama of violence and hope among slave catchers, plantation owners, watermen, runaway slaves, and free blacks. Liz is near death, wracked by disturbing visions of the future, and armed with “the Code,” a fiercely guarded cryptic means of communication for slaves on the run. Liz’s flight and her dreams of tomorrow will thrust all those near her toward a mysterious, redemptive fate. Filled with rich, true details—much of the story is drawn from historical events—and told in McBride’s signature lyrical style, Song Yet Sung is a story of tragic triumph, violent decisions, and unexpected kindness.  ",1594489726,9781594489723),Hardcover,,368 pages,"

Now, on YouTube and blogs and Facebook and Twitter, we are media. And while we watch more television than ever before, how we watch it is changing in ways we have barely slowed down to register. No longer content in our traditional role as couch potatoes, we approach television shows, movies, even advertising as invitations to participate—as experiences to immerse ourselves in at will. Wired contributing editor Frank Rose introduces us to the people who are reshaping media for a two-way world—people like Will Wright (The Sims), James Cameron (Avatar), Damon Lindelof (Lost), and dozens of others whose ideas are changing how we play, how we chill, and even how we think.

","When twelve-year-old Nathan Bailey kills a guard at a juvenile detention center and runs away, the evidence is clear: The guard's murder is part of a brutal escape plan. Declared incorrigible by a judge, and sentenced to 18 months in the Juvenile Detention Center for stealing a car, there's simply no other explanation. Bailey's a thief, a jail breaker and a murderer, and he must be brought to justice. Or so it seems. In ""Nathan's Run,"" first time novelist John Gilstrap displays a unique talent for reaching into today's headlines. His compelling story is woven around two timely issues: the ease with which the juvenile justice system warehouses kids and removes them from our collective consciousness, and the ability of the news media to alter the public's view of individual criminal acts.Fueled by the fiery rhetoric of J. Daniel Petrelli, a local prosecutor with Senatorial ambitions, the public is outraged at Nathan's cold-bloodedness. However, Nathan declares that he killed in self-defense. Polite and articulate, he unwittingly moves beyond the labels that have been thrust upon him -- ""incorrigible"" and ""violent criminal"" -- and becomes to the public at-large what he is in real life; a young boy who's alone in the world, pitted against forces too large for him to comprehend.With it's exceptional realism, suspenseful narrative, and an expertly conveyed sense of desperation, ""Nathan's Run"" is destined to capture the attention of readers and provide John Gilstrap with a legion of fans.",0446604682,9780446604680),Paperback,,384 pages,"

De bekrompen dorpelingen reageren argwanend op zijn komst, zeker als blijkt dat hij drie kinderen van een paar weken oud bij zich heeft, die zelden te zien zijn.
